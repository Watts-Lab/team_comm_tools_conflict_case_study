Not many would begrudge the cop who kills in the line of duty when he had no other choice, and I think that's a valid question for superheroes: can I kill if it's the only way to stop someone without turning him over to the justice system?

The law doesn't perform prevention - the police catch the criminals who break the law (or prevent it from being broken), and the justice system punishes, cordons off, or rehabilitates the criminal. The superhero is an answer to the breakdown of the FIRST part of that system - the catching and preventing. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the second half is broken too.

First, you sound like you’re quite skeptical about therapy in general – it absolutely has the potential to make things worse (which is important to warn clients about), but this is not unlike many medical treatments that cause as much harm as good.  The vast majority of clients do improve, or, at worst, show no improvement.  Very few become markedly worse, and there are enormous studies showing this phenomena (with thousands of participants over many years – look for anything by Lambert, Strupp, or Crits-Christoph if interested).  Therapy works for most people, but it does not work for everyone.  If treatment has to work for everyone who tries it, you need to become equally outraged at the medical field as well.",Umdrehung,1393436976.0
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_2,"Also, it’s worth pointing out that the Rosenhan experiment does NOT show what you claim it does, and it is unfair to assume that it is representative of how commitment processes work.  Professionally, it would never occur to me that someone showing up at an inpatient psychiatric hospital requesting treatment would be “faking it”, and I imagine the people that worked there probably had similar thoughts.",Umdrehung,1393436976.0
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_3,"Second, your assertion that “And that it only takes the word of a psychologist to cause such a hold,” is outright wrong.  Here’s a blurb from Wikipedia:
&gt;In 1978, the Addington v. Texas set the bar for involuntary commitment for treatment by raising the burden of proof required to commit persons from the usual civil burden of proof of ""preponderance of the evidence"" to the higher standard of ""clear and convincing"" evidence.[24]
&gt;An example of involuntary commitment procedures is the Baker Act used in Florida. Under this law, a person may be committed only if they present a danger to themselves or others.
I have committed people before, and the rules about this process are universal as far as I know.  You seem to be under the impression that I can just snap my fingers and the person will be held for for 72 hours (or indefinitely).  The reality is that you need clear and convicing evidence that someone is a harm to themselves and others, and there are specific criteria for that, which involves a clinical interview (remember P.I.M.P - Previous attempts, Ideations, Means, Plan).  You must meet these criteria (not necessarily all 4, but usually the ‘IMP’ part) in order to even get a 72-hour hold.  In those 72-hours, TWO different professionals formally evaluate the person, in addition to the other staff and professionals who may offer their observations to the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrists will often follow up with family/friends (assuming the individual grants permission) in order to get information from as many sources as possible.  In the counties around me, I don’t even get to make the decision really – the hospitals all have a crisis intervention team who actually evaluates the person when they show up to the hospital (before they are ever committed).  They will take my opinion into account, but I have little say in whether or not the hospital agrees that they are dangerous enough to stay.  I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard of people getting to the hospital, regaining some control/composure/having the feelings pass, and then being sent home.",Umdrehung,1393436976.0

Very few become markedly worse, and there are enormous studies showing this phenomena (with thousands of participants over many years – look for anything by Lambert, Strupp, or Crits-Christoph if interested).

The big difference is patient consent. If I specifically do not want some medical treatment or find it harmful, I have a well established right to refuse.

A famous incident was Al Qaeda bombing  the headquarters of the U.N. Assistance mission in Iraq in 2003, which killed the U.N. high commissioner for human rights Sergio de Mello. The role of the soldier in these recent wars hasn't been solely to drop firepower, it has been to provide population security, facilitate good governance, political mediation, and improving the local economy through reconstruction funds, to name a few of the hats that soldiers have been made to wear.",cleaningotis,1382092982.0

Many people in the military and intelligence community included, in hindsight, view the Iraq war as a strategic mistake. But once inside the country, regardless of the motivations to invade, the American military was responsible for the well being of the Iraqi people. The occupation remained longer than expected because Iraq had descended into chaos, Al Qaeda sparked a religious civil war that took the form of ethnic cleansing campaigns by bombing one of the most holy mosques in Shia Islam in Feb 2006. This civil war is what accounts for the hundreds of thousands of civilian dead. The mission of the Iraq war was redefined to much more modest terms, to basically leave the country in a semi normal state of security as well as to foster political reconciliation between dissident groups and insurgents so the Iraqis could figure out there difference via politics rather than communal war, as well as destroyed Al Qaeda in Iraq.

Clearly, there are more purchasers of corporate goods than voters for any single government. A corporation can sell to all 50 states but a state government only has voters from that state. The US Federal government excludes anyone under 18, many felons, and non-citizens. By contrast, travelers, teenagers, non-citizen immigrants, and even people half-a-world away can participate in corporations either through purchasing power or through owning shares. So it would seem that in this sense, corporations give power to a wider group of individuals than governments. But is that a good thing? What if the actions of a corporation are negative for only one segment of the population but beneficial to the rest? Major tyranny of the majority! The US system is designed to divide people into polities by geography partly because it gives those people more autonomy than being awash in a mass-majority-rules situation. If there were no state, county, or town governments, 300 millions Americans would vote exactly where to put our uranium waste and wherever it went, those people would just have to deal. So here's an interesting paradox: spreading the power out to more people results in those people being disempowered relative to a smaller government with less participants deciding their actions for themselves.

2487_B,t1_catuwc7_7,"I won't go on because I don't have the time. Perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points. But I would like to make this point. Governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them. These issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars. There is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that. We must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more, and sometimes it means more regulation not less. I propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed. It is possible that the current US system is failing to facilitate this distribution, it may be the case the the US system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed. But I do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution, not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure (which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism). Therefore, I think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed. In contrast, the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages (violence, economic redistribution, oppression, suppression, etc) but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve (at the behest of the governed) and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed (and the violence of other governments, but that's another story).",FaustTheBird,1372701588.0

This is a false equivalence. You can't just say that gender equality already exists because men and women both have problems. Gender equality isn't a state where both genders are equally subject to social bias, it's a state where neither gender is.

e7boprr,e7dh7ns_1,"Eh, no, Bro.  Slang is a thing but come the fuck on.
Obviously Brett is a smart bastard and phrased everything correctly, but it's obvious he's lied about little things, which is almost worse than lying about big things because it speaks loud to character, which is what matters most in the Supreme Court.",hamletswords,1538970331.0
e7boprr,e7dhzcc,"[His testimony is 100% corroborated](https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/04/kavanaugh-devils-triangle-boofing/). Show me the lies. ""Come the fuck on"" is a terrible reason to accuse someone of perjury in the light of contrary evidence. But, if we're disregarding testimony, I guess Ford is even more of a perjurer because she has *less* corroborating evidence than Kavanaugh at this point. Give me one single quote of his and demonstrate it's a lie. If you cannot do that, then you have no reason to hold your opinion.",RuroniHS,1538971173.0
e7boprr,e7dj4hj,"Wait, what?  You're seriously bringing in unvetted witnesses?  All 7 of them?

Do you realize how many actual very close connections to Brett have come out proclaiming him a staggering drunk mess weekly?",hamletswords,1538972583.0
e7boprr,e7dj9xt,"They are named witnesses and they corroborate his story. You not liking facts doesn't make them untrue. And he never lied about his underaged drinking. So, still no perjury to be found. Not a mile away. ",RuroniHS,1538972778.0
e7boprr,e7dwpl5_1,"Wait so a few named witnesses outweigh over a thousand law professors, the Bar Association, a woman sacrificing her safety and about 10 named people that knew Brett and lived with him?
I'm all for giving a guy the benefit of the doubt.  I am a guy.  I've done dumb shit.  But this fucking stinks to high heaven.",hamletswords,1538997969.0
e7boprr,e7dwpl5_2,"The Supreme Court Justices cannot be ambiguously probably ok people and maybe not gang rapists.  They are the 9 people that decide the fate of all of us.  Traditionally, they've been above reproach.",hamletswords,1538997969.0
e7boprr,e7dx6rj_1,"The terms in his yearbook were not sexual. That is confirmed by his witnesses. None of the things you mentioned are authorities on the stuff in his yearbook.
He admitted to drinking. He admitted to drinking a lot. The two things he said were, ""I didn't black out,"" and ""I didn't have a drinking problem."" Being a sloppy rowdy drunk is not blacking out. So the witnesses are consistent with his testimony. Having a drinking problem is somewhat subjective, but being as nobody has brought up any therapy or recovery sessions, and he has never been referred to as a recovering alcoholic, it is safe to assume that this statement is true too. Where's the perjury?",RuroniHS,1538998782.0
e7boprr,e7dx6rj_2,"Give me a direct quote from Brett made under oath that is untrue, and then, directly beneath that quote, cite the specific evidence that proves he is a liar. You can namedrop all the professors that you want. It's all irrelevant if you can't even quote me a single false statement.",RuroniHS,1538998782.0
e7boprr,e7dy58a_1,"It's bullshit.  Have you ever drank alcohol to excess as Brett admitted he did?  If you have, you know you may sometimes forget stuff, or act like an idiot.
That is fine, you're expected to do that.  Fucking everyone in the world has done that.
But Brett acted like he drank a lot and somehow was 100% positive he never acted like an idiot.",hamletswords,1539000271.0
e7boprr,e7dy58a_2,"It's wreaks of bullshit.  It stinks so strong you can smell it in other countries.  And yet now here he is sitting on the Supreme Court.
Yes, there's a figurative explanation.  Brett is obviously hyper intelligent and will always leave room for that.  But regardless, the whole thing stinks.
Matt Damon nailed it on SNL, portraying Brett, yelling ""I was the drunkest Virgin that never thought about sex, ever!""",hamletswords,1539000271.0
e7boprr,e7etums,"Give me a direct quote from Brett made under oath that is untrue, and then, directly beneath that quote, cite the specific evidence that proves he is a liar. Nothing else you have to say is relevant. ",RuroniHS,1539029663.0

Ordinarily, this would be fine, and I think it is for the most part effective against ordinary criminals who are easily contained. When we consider supervillains, we consistently see that they either break free of capture or avoid getting captured in the first place. These villains often go on to pursue other schemes that result in significant harm or death to innocent civilians. If that's the case, then it would be better for heroes to apply lethal force in order to prevent villains from escaping and endangering more lives. Note that this does not always entail killing. A hero would not be justified in killing a villain if merely handicapping that villain would be equally or more effective at preventing harm. My basic argument boils down to:

1. It is justified to use the minimal amount of force necessary to safely prevent a person from infringing on others' rights, provided that the minimal amount is still reasonably proportional to the crime that would be committed (We would permit a John to kill Jack if it was necessary in order to prevent Jack from killing another person, but would not allow John to kill Jack if it were the minimal amount of force necessary to prevent him from stealing $5.)

2. Supervillains often commit crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people. 

3. Crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people warrant the criminal being killed if necessary.

4. Thus, the crimes that supervillains commit warrant them being killed if it is necessary.

5. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is the minimal amount of force to subdue them as capture is not an option.

C. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is morally permissible; obligatory if you think superheroes have a moral obligation to stop villains.

**TL;DR:** Killing or handicapping prevents villains from infringing on others rights better than simple capture does, so superheroes should use those means.

Extra note: I bring up killing because for certain varieties of villains, such as psychic villains like Psimon, magic villains like Loki, or smart villains like Lex Luthor cannot have their relevant abilities handicapped without doing something that is probably about as bad as killing them (granted, I don't know enough about superhero universes to know if there are ways to disable these abilities).

**tl;dr:** killing or handicapping prevents villains from infringing on others rights better than simple capture does, so superheroes should use those means.

extra note: i bring up killing because for certain varieties of villains, such as psychic villains like psimon, magic villains like loki, or smart villains like lex luthor cannot have their relevant abilities handicapped without doing something that is probably about as bad as killing them (granted, i don't know enough about superhero universes to know if there are ways to disable these abilities).

posts getting buried and early posts remaining at the top of the thread  this phenomenon is the direct result of the fact that most people only read the first few comments in a thread combined with the fact that people tend to upvote significantly more than they downvotelet me use a hypothetical example to explain my point  imagine there is a 5 hour old thread with 100 comments in it and the top five comments are all mediocre comments that 50 of people who read them upvote  then someone posts an extremely high quality comment that over 90 of people who read it upvote  this comment starts with 1 upvote so it is at position 70 or so out of the 100 comments  so after a couple hours 1000 people view the comments 100 of them view the first five comments and only about 2 of them view the 70th comment  so the top five mediocre comments would get upvotes from 50 of the 1000 people 500 upvotes and the amazing post at position 70 would get upvotes form 90 of the people who read it 18 upvotes  i hope this illustrates how in a world where people only use upvotes and not downvotes top posts will tend to remain at the top even if they are only moderately good comments while great comments that are posted late will tend to remain near the middle or bottom unless they are linked to by rbestof or somethingi think we can all agree that it is more desirable to have comments sorted by perceived quality than by some other arbitrary method how early you posted  if instead of only using upvotes people used downvotes just as frequently this problem is greatly improved  in the same example as before lets assume that everyone votes up or down on every post they read  so instead of just not upvoting the posts that they feel dont deserve an upvote they downvote it  in this situation 50 of people would upvote the top five posts and 50 of people would downvote them so even though only 2 of people actually go down the list to read the high quality 70th post its upvote count will still rise faster than the top five mediocre postsi believe that in a subreddit such as rcmv you should not downvote opinions just because you disagree with them but i also think that you shouldnt upvote comments just because you agree with them for the same reason  you should upvote comments that you feel are of high quality and downvote comments you feel are of low quality  we want the comments to

down based on how compelling they feel the argument isim going to preempt a few concerns here1 downvoting discourages people from voicing unpopular opinionsfirst off i dont think you should downvote an opinion for being unpopular but only if you think it is a bad argument ie it is a logical fallacy or it makes some assertions that are objectively wrong like if they claimed that we shouldnt invade iran because its in south america  secondly i think its more important to sort comments properly than to worry about peoples feelings getting hurt from negative karma  i think if you are avoiding posting things because you are worried about a negative karma score that is pretty ridiculous2 even if most people think a comment is low quality that doesnt mean everyone will think so  by downvoting comments that the majority of people find low quality you are making it less likely that someone who might find it compelling will see ityou could make the same argument against sorting it by upvotes only  just because the majority of people consider a post to be high quality doesnt mean everyone will and by allowing the highest upvoted comments to rise to the top you are pushing the less popular posts to the bottom making them less likely to be seen by someone who isnt convinced by the popular arguments  i think if you want to make this argument you cant just make it against downvotes but against sorting by perceived quality in general3 if people downvote ops comments heshe wont get as many responses so it will be harder to change their viewi agree 100 with this and you should never downvote ops comments in their own thread  but if you arent the op then i think it is better to address the most compelling arguments4  it is better to report arguments that break the rules than to downvote themi am not talking about comments that violate the rules  i am talking about totally legitimate comments that address the topic with real questions and concerns  but if there are a lot of really great comments they should be sorted in a logical way with the best comments first and the worst comments last  yes you should report any comments that violate the rules  other than that you should upvote comments you find especially good and downvote comments you find especially bad  maybe there are two comments making the same point but one does so with referenced sources and the other does so without sources and in a confusing or arrogant way  so upvote the better one and downvote the worse one even though neither of them needs to be reportededit  id also like to add that i dont

So instead of just not upvoting the posts that they feel don’t deserve an upvote, they downvote it.

I believe that in a subreddit such as /r/CMV you should not downvote opinions just because you disagree with them, but I also think that you shouldn’t upvote comments just because you agree with them for the same reason.  You should upvote comments that you feel are of high quality and downvote comments you feel are of low quality.  We want the comments to be sorted from best to worst so that when someone visits a thread they will be confronted with the most compelling arguments first.

So that is why I think it is misguided for the mods of /r/CMV to encourage people to not downvote posts *in general*.  I totally support them asking people to not vote just based on whether they agree or disagree with someone, but I think people should vote both up and down based on how compelling they feel the argument is.

I’m going to preempt a few concerns here:

1) Downvoting discourages people from voicing unpopular opinions.

First off, I don’t think you should downvote an opinion for being unpopular, but only if you think it is a bad argument (i.e. it is a logical fallacy or it makes some assertions that are objectively wrong, like if they claimed that we shouldn’t invade Iran because it’s in South America).  Secondly, I think it’s more important to sort comments properly than to worry about people’s feelings getting hurt from negative karma.  I think if you are avoiding posting things because you are worried about a negative karma score, that is pretty ridiculous.


2) Even if most people think a comment is low quality, that doesn’t mean everyone will think so.  By downvoting comments that the majority of people find low quality, you are making it less likely that someone who might find it compelling will see it.

You could make the same argument against sorting it by upvotes only.  “Just because the majority of people consider a post to be high quality doesn’t mean everyone will and by allowing the highest upvoted comments to rise to the top you are pushing the less popular posts to the bottom making them less likely to be seen by someone who isn’t convinced by the popular arguments.”  I think if you want to make this argument, you can’t just make it against downvotes, but against sorting by perceived quality in general.


3) If people downvote OP’s comments, he/she won’t get as many responses so it will be harder to change their view.

I agree 100% with this and you should never downvote OP’s comments in their own thread.  But if you aren’t the OP, then I think it is better to address the most compelling arguments.


4)  It is better to report arguments that break the rules than to downvote them.

I am not talking about comments that violate the rules.  I am talking about totally legitimate comments that address the topic with real questions and concerns.  But if there are a lot of really great comments, they should be sorted in a logical way with the best comments first and the worst comments last.  Yes, you should report any comments that violate the rules.  Other than that, you should upvote comments you find especially good and downvote comments you find especially bad.  Maybe there are two comments making the same point but one does so with referenced sources and the other does so without sources and in a confusing or arrogant way.  So upvote the better one and downvote the worse one even though neither of them needs to be reported.


**EDIT**:  I'd also like to add that I don't think there is really any value in downvoting people into the negatives unless they are trolling.  I can see how that would be disheartening to people trying to contribute while not really adding anything to the sorting.  I would suggest that people down't downvote comments that are made in good faith that are already at 0.

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora

I'm a senior in high school, and I have never really been a huge reader. I read one series addictively in 4th grade, The Guardians of Ga'Hoole, and have read various books over the years but have never gotten into it much other than that, especially lately. I got halfway through the Steve Jobs biography last summer and enjoyed it a lot, and plan on finishing it, but haven't had time/motivation so far. I have a couple other books that sound interesting to me but I've never gotten around to. Many people say that reading is really good for you, and important. I consider myself intelligent (not in an arrogant way, but I am intellectual and can handle myself well in academic, philosophical, and logic based conversations, to summarize crudely), and understand that I may enjoy reading when I'm a little older. 

However.. I'm just wondering, is that truly necessary? Is it a necessary fact of life, inevitable for me to fall into, or is it simply society's chosen medium of information and life fulfillment? 

I am not inactive physically or mentally. I do karate, play basketball, baseball, every instrument in my own rock music solo album, I write, I rock climb, I teach karate, I think, I do various forms of yoga including hatha and acro-yoga, and I have discussions and debates with people often. 

I'm sure reading couldn't hurt this list, but it's so painful for me, I just have no desire. I haven't read a single word of my assigned books in school this year, as I preferred to participate in the class discussions and write quality essays based on these discussions. 

Without telling me just that ""reading is good for me"", please change my view by providing a good argument for why I absolutely need to read books, even if it's only during a certain time in my life. 

I should add that I read articles on the Internet all the time, tech related, politics related, whatever reddit force feeds me :P so I have the capacity to read, but I guess I haven't found justification for reading full books so far. To reiterate in a more simple way, is reading just a personal passion that can achieve great benefits, or is it something that everybody needs to do, myself included? (Seeing as I don't have a passion for reading personally).

So reddit, change my view.

i have some professors that speak in such a thick accent that i have to strain to make out their words. this has a huge impact on my ability to learn (and therefore the professors ability to teach). therefore, if a university does claim to value teaching ability in its employees, it should consider the speaking ability of its employees.",0.1570300310850143,0.1735494136810302,0.669420599937439,187,1092,1,0.6126427302932852,2.0810755288559437,3,3,0,5,2,3,0,9,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,7,7,0,17,3,2,13,0,1,0,10,12,0,24,1,3,2,3,3,5,1,25,0,14,4,18,22,28,0,7,1,13,3,87,1,0,0,0.6042780748663101,0.0481283422459893,41,0.26149102556103243,1.05,1,0.5343749999999999,0.28020833333333334,0.3583434708508163,-0.04373861228411238,7.424618297872341,difficult,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,13,0,0,1,3,0,6,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,217,5.660769230769231,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,1,0,0.3837482426853681,0.37287016403081025,0.357859372277051

First, you sound like you’re quite skeptical about therapy in general – it absolutely has the potential to make things worse (which is important to warn clients about), but this is not unlike many medical treatments that cause as much harm as good.  The vast majority of clients do improve, or, at worst, show no improvement.  Very few become markedly worse, and there are enormous studies showing this phenomena (with thousands of participants over many years – look for anything by Lambert, Strupp, or Crits-Christoph if interested).

Here’s a blurb from Wikipedia:
&gt;In 1978, the Addington v. Texas set the bar for involuntary commitment for treatment by raising the burden of proof required to commit persons from the usual civil burden of proof of ""preponderance of the evidence"" to the higher standard of ""clear and convincing"" evidence.[24]
&gt;An example of involuntary commitment procedures is the Baker Act used in Florida. Under this law, a person may be committed only if they present a danger to themselves or others.
I have committed people before, and the rules about this process are universal as far as I know.  You seem to be under the impression that I can just snap my fingers and the person will be held for for 72 hours (or indefinitely).  The reality is that you need clear and convicing evidence that someone is a harm to themselves and others, and there are specific criteria for that, which involves a clinical interview (remember P.I.M.P - Previous attempts, Ideations, Means, Plan).  You must meet these criteria (not necessarily all 4, but usually the ‘IMP’ part) in order to even get a 72-hour hold.  In those 72-hours, TWO different professionals formally evaluate the person, in addition to the other staff and professionals who may offer their observations to the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrists will often follow up with family/friends (assuming the individual grants permission) in order to get information from as many sources as possible.  In the counties around me, I don’t even get to make the decision really – the hospitals all have a crisis intervention team who actually evaluates the person when they show up to the hospital (before they are ever committed).  They will take my opinion into account, but I have little say in whether or not the hospital agrees that they are dangerous enough to stay.  I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard of people getting to the hospital, regaining some control/composure/having the feelings pass, and then being sent home.","second, your assertion that “and that it only takes the word of a psychologist to cause such a hold,” is outright wrong.  here’s a blurb from wikipedia:

Specifically regarding primary and secondary education, we must also account for the harmful effects of having a label attached to you. I remember being told of a study where researchers swapped the profiles of elementary school students around. Formerly star students were given class trouble maker's profiles and vice versa. The researchers apparently found that performance of the students matched the provided records, suggesting that much of the discrepancy in school performance came from the teacher's preconceived bias. Getting a label of mental illness is sure to attach this sort of bias to you, causing great harm. In a worst case, students can even be separated from general population, or singled out for punishment on the basis of such labels. 

My father still describes how one of his early girlfriend's family sent her to a psychologist to convince her that he was ""sent by the devil to tempt her"" and thus convince her not to pursue  any sort of relationship with him. We can also see how Soviet dissenters were labeled as 'insane' and made to go through psychological treatment to correct their errant viewpoints. Even today, in the west, the field seems to lean in favor of authoritarian ideologies. Given the subjective nature of the field, I have reason to worry about being diagnosed as mentally ill on the basis of my political ideology alone.

specifically regarding primary and secondary education, we must also account for the harmful effects of having a label attached to you. i remember being told of a study where researchers swapped the profiles of elementary school students around. formerly star students were given class trouble maker's profiles and vice versa. the researchers apparently found that performance of the students matched the provided records, suggesting that much of the discrepancy in school performance came from the teacher's preconceived bias. getting a label of mental illness is sure to attach this sort of bias to you, causing great harm. in a worst case, students can even be separated from general population, or singled out for punishment on the basis of such labels. 

my father still describes how one of his early girlfriend's family sent her to a psychologist to convince her that he was ""sent by the devil to tempt her"" and thus convince her not to pursue  any sort of relationship with him. we can also see how soviet dissenters were labeled as 'insane' and made to go through psychological treatment to correct their errant viewpoints. even today, in the west, the field seems to lean in favor of authoritarian ideologies. given the subjective nature of the field, i have reason to worry about being diagnosed as mentally ill on the basis of my political ideology alone.

This means that a single global disaster large enough could wipe out our entire species.  
Now I'm not saying that this is going to happen anywhere in the following 1000 years or indeed anytime soon, but considering the fact that the planet has already seen five mass-extinction events, it is very likely (and I would like to say inevitable) that something along these lines is going to happen again someday or another.

The odds of another asteroid like the one from the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction might be quite low on the short term, but high in the long run. And we should remember that it carries a risk so incredibly high (i.e. the extinction of the entirety of our species) that we should, at the very least, *start* research on making sure not all of ours eggs are in one basket.  
And of course, that's not the only danger: extreme climate changes and thermonuclear wars are just two examples of things that could completely fuck each and every one of us over.  
It doesn't matter if it happens tomorrow or in a hundred thousand years (not to mention the lack of resources in 100k years): the chances of, *eventually*, something happening to the planet that will cause another mass extinction event are pretty much 1.

Colonizing other planets would spread this risk, and quite probably not just to two planets. Because if we have the technology to live independently on other planets, why stop at two? But even if we stopped at just two as a maximum amount of planets, the odds of survival increase tremendously. After all, mass extinction events aren't exactly so common that they would occur on both planets at once.

I believe the reason for an organism to exist, is to help ensure the survival of its species, and that by not researching heavily into something that will, quite probably,  save the entirety of the species, we are neglecting the sole reason of our collective existences.

EDIT: Apparently this didn't really come across in my initial post, but I'm talking about a time span of several hundred years, I'm not saying we should have a colony on Mars by next Wednesday. I'm saying we should start focusing on research for interstellar travel now, so that by, say, 2500, we have the technology to colonize other habitable planets (although the sooner the better, of course).","**currently, every single human being lives either on, or in orbit of, the planet earth**. this means that a single global disaster large enough could wipe out our entire species.

**1. Depression is self-inflicted**

People who suffer from depression are usually not billionaires, bon vivants and socially esteemed high achievers, but those who made bad decisions in the past. They maybe didn't follow through with their education, they maybe didn't find out what motivates them in life, they maybe abused drugs and/or alcohol, they maybe put all their effort in getting meaningless sex. Now they're an empty shell and don't know why.

You might point me to some celebrity exceptions, those who seem to have it all, but still suffer depression to the point where they even commit suicide. But do they really have it all? Some abuse drugs, some can't form a personal relationship, some become arrogant assholes.

You can change my view on this by giving me statistics that prove that sober, highly connected, social, educated people are at the same risk to become depressed as drug/alcohol abusing, shut-in, antisocial, uneducated people.

**2. Depressed people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps**

Following contention 1, depressed people can find out why they are depressed and do something about it. They can find their passion in life, they can become healthier, more educated, gain social skills, etc. If you're depressed because you don't have a significant other, work towards that goal. If you loathe your minimum-wage job, get higher education or start your own business. If you are disgusted by your appearance, work out and eat healthily.

The comic at the start simply addresses depression as if the people around the protagonist don't acknowledge or understand it. In my opinion, when someone tells you that they're depressed, you shouldn't tell them to snap out of it, but rather ask: ""What are you doing about it?""

First of all, obvious point - 50% of marriages end in divorce, so you know there's a good chance it won't work out. But even if you do make it work - at what cost, to your and your partner's happiness? I think that if you really do love each other, you will stick together for as long as that holds true, marriage or not. Marriage is a way of saying ""even if we start to absolutely hate each others guts, we're bound to each other like it or not."" Why would you subject yourself to that potential torment? If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be - let each other go. And are you so afraid that your partner will stop loving you and leave you for someone else, that you have to handcuff them to you with marriage? If your love for your partner is anything more than purely selfish, you should want your partner to be happy. So you should let them go if their happiness requires it. If the relationship goes sour, you should just be able to say ""okay we're done. Peace out."" But if you're married, then you have to go through the whole messy divorce problem, after ""trying to make it work"" with marriage counseling for who knows how many years. Essentially, by getting married you earn yourself no advantages in your relationship, but you put yourself at risk for some serious unhappiness. I understand there may be certain legal benefits, but lets leave that aside, since no one cites tax write-offs as their primary reason for getting married. 

More generally, I believe that this romantic ideal of two people faithfully monogamous to each other for the rest of their lives is just pure Disney, and it's causing more harm than good. So a lot of my criticism of marriage applies to monogamous relationships in general. We will continue to suffer from relationships - either staying in unhappy ones, or being devastated when a partner leaves or cheats on us - until we accept that both partners are free and independent human beings, and a good relationship is one that is enthusiastically engaged in on both sides. If for whatever reason one partner is unhappy with the relationship, then they should be free to leave it without any shame or guilt. They shouldn't feel like they have to hide their feelings, or go behind their partner's back and cheat on them. I think it's perfectly natural for a relationship to have its time, and run its course. By letting go of a bad relationship, you open yourself up to a better one.

What I said was that slavery was the primary cause of the civil war; all the other cause are tied into that one central thread.

1) SOUTHERN LIFESTYLE - Some say the South was fighting to preserve their way of life.  I don't think anyone was trying to stop them from drinking sweet tea or eating grits.  The aspect of the southern lifestyle that caused war was slavery.  

2) STATES RIGHTS - States rights for what?  I know the South was angry about tarrifs imposed by the North too, but c'mon.  No one in Kansas was killing eachother about tarrifs.

3) ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES - I agree with this one.  The North was an industrialized society, powered by wage labor.  The South was a rural, agricultural society powered by slave labor.  So slavery figures centrally into this one.  

4) BUT MOST WHITE SOUTHERNERS DIDN'T OWN SLAVES - Yes, this is true. But slavery was still important to non-slave owners for two reasons.  One, may thought they would own slaves someday.  Also it was central to the white supremacist racial ideology.  A white Southerner could be completely poor, but at least (in his mind) he wasn't a slave.  

5) BUT MANY NORTHERNERS WERE RACIST TOO - So?  Many Americans were racist during WWII but it doesn't mean that they didn't find Hitler's ideas completely disgusting.  

Anyway those are the main ones I always hear.  Please CMV

The plots with The Wall and The Targaryens are essentially scaffolding for events in future seasons. This leaves the Lannisters, King Baratheon, and the Starks as possible protagonists. 

 

Out of these three, only the Lannisters control the plot. The Starks and Robert respond to and try to counter the Lannisters' plots. Since only the Lannisters are guiding the plot they are the protagonists, while the Starks are the antagonists since they oppose the Lannisters' decisions.

2073_B,t3_1onlj1,1,1,1,0,TheScienceGuy2,so i have seen this type of post before on cmv and i would like to just put a few more points out and try and figure this out for myself i am going to make my points bullet form so the are easy to respond to also just before i start i want to make it clear that that i have 100 respect for the troops of ww1 and ww2 because those wars involved mandatory service and real threats to the safety of the planet also i respect the troops as human beings just not for their possible viewactions anyways my points are thesegt1 when you look at war from a countries point of view it makes sense why people would think they are fighting for the rightpatriotism and lies about motives how do you know that you are fighting for the right every time a soldier comes home for your country one doesnt come home from another country it all seems so pointless and primal when looked at through a global perspectivegt2 ive seen alot of soldiers state that they are there for peaceful purposes and if that is the case why dont we have a peacekeeping organization that can be signed up for opposed to the military in my opinion 2 organizations seperated like this would have completely different view on how to handle situations if we do have an organization like this why not join thatgt3 i just dont see how going in to kill people can be respected especially when they are sometimes innocent a classic example is the collateral damage video where it is very clear they are not there for peaceful purposesgt4 is there any points to the wars we are in right now other than money for the contractors and equipment providers war is a major driver of this terrible economic system and without it millions of people wouldnt have jobs it seems that it is kept around solely for the purpose of keeping the economy runningthank you for reading i know my beliefs could be seen as radical and i thank you for all your responseedit people have wanted me to clarify my title so by the mindset of the troops i mean to say the underlying principlesvalues that the military seems to hold such as violence is an alright way to solve problems and killing is ok people that i am around that want to join the military dont seem to be very down to earth and are more about joining because of the guns and toughness of being in the military so maybe that is where my bias arises ,"So i have seen this type of post before on CMV and i would like to just put a few more points out and try and figure this out for myself. I am going to make my points bullet form so the are easy to respond to. Also just before i start i want to make it clear that that i have 100% respect for the troops of WW1 and WW2 because those wars involved mandatory service, and real threats to the safety of the planet. Also I respect the troops as human beings, just not for their possible view/actions. Anyways my points are these.
&gt;1. **When you look at war from a countries point of view, it makes sense why people would think they are fighting for the ""right""(patriotism and lies about motives) how do you KNOW that you are fighting for the right? Every time a soldier comes home for your country, one doesn't come home from another country. It all seems so pointless and primal when looked at through a global perspective**.
&gt;2. **I've seen alot of soldiers state that they are there for peaceful purposes, and if that is the case, why don't we have a peacekeeping organization that can be signed up for opposed to the military. In my opinion, 2 organizations seperated like this would have completely different view on how to handle situations. If we do have an organization like this, why not join that**?
&gt;3. **I just don't see how going in to kill people can be respected, especially when they are sometimes innocent, a classic example is the ""collateral damage"" video, where it is very clear they are not there for peaceful purposes**.
&gt;4. **Is there any points to the wars we are in right now, other than money for the contractors and equipment providers? War is a major driver of this terrible economic system, and without it, millions of people wouldn't have jobs. It seems that it is kept around solely for the purpose of keeping the economy running**.

Thank you for reading, I know my beliefs could be seen as radical and I thank you for all your response.

**Edit**: People have wanted me to clarify my title, so by the ""mindset of the troops"" i mean to say the underlying principles/values that the military seems to hold. Such as Violence is an alright way to solve problems and killing is ok. People that i am around that want to join the military don't seem to be very down to earth, and are more about joining because of the guns and toughness of being in the military, so maybe that is where my bias arises.

For a behavior to happen, there needs to be some sort of motivation. Intrinsic or extrinsic, there is a need for people to behave a certain way. Extrinsic motivation is plain and simple. The most common is money. People work for money, people steal for money, people who do charity gain acceptance of society, which in turn lets them earn more from their enterprises since the company they represent is more accepted. That's what i believe. 

Even if there is an intrinsic motivation, the person definitely have to do it for his or her own cause. For example, a generous person who makes self-sacrifices for others could gain satisfaction in his own mind that he's done something ""good"" and the social acceptance which he gets would motivate him to do more kind deeds, since society as a whole promotes pro-social behaviors. 

Or someone sees an injustice and steps in for the victim. The person seeing the injustice could just be annoyed at the situation and in order to resolve the annoyance he steps in to help the weak. I would also think that that's just a method for the person to deal with some internal unsolved issues to make himself/herself feel better. For example, a man who was a bully victim steps in to fight off some bullies because he did not have the courage to stand up to them when he was younger. Because of that, he may feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in himself. Thus, since there is a personal gain, I do not see pure kindness. 

So basically even when someone does something good or kind, i would attribute it to his or her need to be socially accepted or the self-satisfaction, and when there's personal gain from displaying pro-social behaviors, I do not believe that people can have pure kindness. But hey, that's just my opinion man.


Edit: ok basically, I believe that there will always be personal benefits when someone does some kind deed that is beneficial to others. Without the personal benefit, nobody will do anything solely for the benefit of others. 

No matter how I looked at things, I can always attribute acts if kindness with some form of personal gains. 

I may not have phrased it correctly saying that everyone is selfish. I just tend to be quite avoidant at times and think the worst of people. Lol

Edit2: so many people talked about positive and negative values. So my question is: how do you determine the TRUE values of one's motivations for an action?

I don't know if these are common all over the world but they are very common in the United States

Now, I understand the advantages of a single use restroom. They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user. However, at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice. The most convincing argument I've read against unisex restrooms is that some people are uncomfortable urinating/defecating around the opposite sex, but this doesn't apply to single use restrooms since the occupant is alone anyway.

What if there are five women in line for a single use restroom, but no men? That line of women could be moving twice as fast if they had two restrooms available. Unfortunately for them, the other restroom is only for men, so they're just going to have to hold it.

This restriction strikes me as totally arbitrary. It has an obvious downside with no notable upsides that I can see.

However. This open relationship thing has started to come up more and more in my dating life and it sounds like simple bullshit to me. I don't see how you can have a meaningful, healthy and truly intimate connection with someone if there is a chance that someone else can 'be' with your significant other in that way. 

Now, I am not jealous or insecure when it comes to my relationships but I think that emotionally and definitely physically the connection to one person comes from being with that one person. Not that one person on Thursday, I can still get that other person's number Friday and if I feel like hopping in the bed with someone else that Sunday it's fine. On the flipside I totally respect their honesty about not being monogamous instead of cheating on someone unknowing. 

Change my view. Or at least help me to see the POV more clearly of those that believe in open relationships.

EDIT: Okay...thanks to everyone that shared their experiences and opinions on this topic. I learned A TON! I can totally say that I can accept that there are people that the poly life simply 'works for' and for others it doesn't. Thanks to everyone that was super transparent sharing their ups and downs.

To the people that were kind of a dick I expected you here and there were so few so I still feel good about asking how and what I asked.

I will reply more limited to those that still choose to comment but thanks because I not only understand the POV I must say I suppose I have actually changed my view. :)

TL;DR: I think open relationships are bullshit CMV
EDIT: My view was changed.

The same goes for sexism and other forms of discrimination that generally aren't acceptable in modern society but that we tend to give the Baby Boomers and prior generations a pass on.  The fact that the man in the article is a public figure is the only reason his racism is coming under fire, because if any other old man/woman said the same shit, even the least racist people I know would shrug and say something about not even being worth the confrontation due to them being so old and set in their ways.  I believe that no matter how old you are, you have to live up to the standards of the society you live in *now*, not the one you lived in growing up.

I can give 2 examples: some years ago I saw Citizen kane for the first time, I understand as a movie being realeased in the time of musicals and westerns it must have been an amazing breath of fresh air, but decades away it's looks to me just as an ok movie, so I refrained from rating as it would be unfair to give it a relativelly slow rating.

Another example was the blues brothers: saw it weeks ago and thought it was mainly boring and childish, after seeing the reviews (and trying to understand the high rating) I realized at it's time with those actors, those cameos it must have been something great, just not from my actual point of view...

They have all they need, they have a telos, and they strike me as more possible for humanity to achieve than the peace required by the Federation.

To the first point, that they have all their needs taken care of and have an arsenal and quick, global hive learning which renders them nearly indestructible. Death is no object because life is in service to the hive and corpses are taken up for resources and information.

The second point is pretty cool. The whole of the Borg is driven by a sense of purpose--approaching perfection through incorporating greater intelligence and diversity into themselves. While individual humans have senses of purpose, the whole of humanity has no agreed-upon purpose and human conflict is the result. The Borg are internally peaceful.

The third point, that it is a likelier future for humanity than the Federation, I base in part on the accelerating returns of technology. We already have human brain-to-computer interfacing and rat brain-to-brain interfacing. With cloud computing as well, it is looking pretty likely that sooner or later we will have internet-facilitated human brain-to-brain interfacing. I consider the singularity an inevitability barring nuclear holocaust or environmental collapse, while the peace required of a Federation member I consider highly unlikely from a non-hivemind humanity.

Two elements of the Borg I expect to come up here:

Individuality. Rather, the lack of it. Though I have it and enjoy it, for the Borg it is a non-issue. It is a tradeoff, initially, to be sure, individuality for a hive mind, but afterward, the Borg are no more aware of individuality than are our individual neurons. It is a clumsiness shed in favour of a larger system with loftier goals higher purposes, and greater abilities to realize those goals and purposes. The individuals of the Borg act like the hands and eyes and neurons of a larger organism, not as independent specimens, so I consider it insufficient to say ""I don't want to be a Borg person"". There is no such thing. Your consciousness and identity are those of the hive. Your body is no longer tied to your personhood.

Secondly, violence. Assimilation sounds pretty bad, no? But in First Contact we learn that the Borg do not just kidnap and plug in, and that's the end. They kidnap, and forcefully expose lifeforms to the benefits of the Collective, and await free choice to join or not.

Even so, this is extremely violent. It is not injurious to the person (on the contrary, it is empowering!). It doesn't change human history, but only human future. And the new human future would be one in which, on top of our own creativity and intellect, we can capitalize on that if others too, and even other species.

So, I believe the Borg to be a better (and likelier) future for humanity than a (mostly) peaceful Federation of Planets.

i think that's a little silly. besides, isn't a little rule breaking integral to language evolving? surely in the hay days of early language people got tired of using two words to say something and instead decided to combine the words -- giving birth to the contraction!

Clearly, there are more purchasers of corporate goods than voters for any single government. A corporation can sell to all 50 states but a state government only has voters from that state. The US Federal government excludes anyone under 18, many felons, and non-citizens. By contrast, travelers, teenagers, non-citizen immigrants, and even people half-a-world away can participate in corporations either through purchasing power or through owning shares. So it would seem that in this sense, corporations give power to a wider group of individuals than governments. But is that a good thing? What if the actions of a corporation are negative for only one segment of the population but beneficial to the rest? Major tyranny of the majority! The US system is designed to divide people into polities by geography partly because it gives those people more autonomy than being awash in a mass-majority-rules situation. If there were no state, county, or town governments, 300 millions Americans would vote exactly where to put our uranium waste and wherever it went, those people would just have to deal. So here's an interesting paradox: spreading the power out to more people results in those people being disempowered relative to a smaller government with less participants deciding their actions for themselves. Hmmm. Add on the fact that economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few already, and we start to see that one vote per person matters a lot when calculating the level of power concentration and its impact on decision making.","(2)

2487_B,t1_catuwc7_7,1,1,1,0,FaustTheBird,i wont go on because i dont have the time perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points but i would like to make this point governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them these issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars there is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that we must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more and sometimes it means more regulation not less i propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed it is possible that the current us system is failing to facilitate this distribution it may be the case the the us system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed but i do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism therefore i think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed in contrast the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages violence economic redistribution oppression suppression etc but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve at the behest of the governed and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed and the violence of other governments but thats another story,"I won't go on because I don't have the time. Perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points. But I would like to make this point. Governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them. These issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars. There is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that. We must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more, and sometimes it means more regulation not less. I propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed. It is possible that the current US system is failing to facilitate this distribution, it may be the case the the US system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed. But I do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution, not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure (which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism). Therefore, I think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed. In contrast, the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages (violence, economic redistribution, oppression, suppression, etc) but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve (at the behest of the governed) and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed (and the violence of other governments, but that's another story).","i won't go on because i don't have the time. perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points. but i would like to make this point. governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them. these issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars. there is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that. we must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more, and sometimes it means more regulation not less. i propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed. it is possible that the current us system is failing to facilitate this distribution, it may be the case the the us system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed. but i do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution, not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure (which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism). therefore, i think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed. in contrast, the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages (violence, economic redistribution, oppression, suppression, etc) but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve (at the behest of the governed) and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed (and the violence of other governments, but that's another story).",0.0542562529444694,0.2437905520200729,0.7019531726837158,322,1941,1,1.4902717342452383,2.4967766788322496,3,0,0,16,5,12,2,16,5,0,0,11,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,12,11,11,1,24,10,2,29,0,4,1,15,17,0,20,7,14,2,0,0,9,12,38,0,30,17,29,67,46,4,0,1,15,4,151,1,0,0,0.5,0.034161490683229816,124,1.3522578401159013,4.270097908913699,1,0.5185185185185185,0.10659371492704828,-0.22383499773361631,-0.07553825778155729,7.468333954451346,difficult,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,19,0,0,11,8,0,11,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,355,6.0963157894736835,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,0.7138627638616781,0.5645086846001292,0.27518380140149334

The problem with that distinction is that it's entirely narrowly focused on exactly what action you should take to effect the shortest possible term of positive change without any respect for the actual effect you're facilitating. Democratic governments are extensions of the power of the citizen. As you note, they often need reform, much like any other system could need reform.

In the United States, we are presented with a false dichotomy between right-wing ""corporatists"" and left-wing ""statists"", when both sides represent entrenched, powerful interests. The interests of both sides (corporations and government entities) are similarly at odds with those of the majority of the population, and in many cases the corporate interests and statist interests are literally the same people with the same agendas.

It is often argued that the role of democracy is to ensure that government works toward the common good, but this ignores an important fact: everyone has one vote, but some people have one vote and billions of dollars with which to influence government. Government will inevitably serve the interests of those who have one vote and billions of dollars over those who just have one vote.

The American right argues that state intervention in the economy and society as a whole is often immoral, unfair, and damaging -- I think this is correct. The American left argues that corporations have the same negative effects, and I think this is correct as well.

I think that the primary cause of this problem is the incestuous relationship between corporations and government (""K Street""), but I also think that further regulations on government behavior to limit this kind of corruption would be necessarily ineffective, due to the intrinsic connection between wealth and political power.

I am most familiar with American politics, so those are the examples I have used here, but I don't think this problem is uniquely American. I would like to be convinced that there is a way that we can limit this destructive tendency, but I cannot envision a way that this can be done (at least not without having hugely destructive effects on the rest of society).

When I had the opportunity to engage with my philosophy professor's research I always found it valuable, if not also interesting.  Some problems in formal logic, for example, bear immediate importance to issues in subjects like computer programming and math.  Even philosophy that doesn't seem as 'useful,' such as aesthetics and metaphysics, seems valuable insofar as it is the pursuit of an accurate understanding of reality at a very foundational level. 

But I've never encountered this kind of value in the research of English professors.  To use cliché examples, I don't see how themes of death in Hamlet, or the role of silence in Attic Greek tragedies, valuably informs our understanding of the universe, or gives us any 'practical' benefit.  These interests do not seem like the sort of thing that major research institutions should fund in the large-scale way that they do now.  In some institutions, for example, there are well over a hundred tenure-level English professors.  I don't see why most of these professors ought not be phased out and replaced with professional lecturers.  Their work seems interesting as a hobby - I think that many people could discuss the role of silence in Greek tragedy for hours if they wanted - but I don't think that it's valuable on the level of philosophy, physics, math, anthropology, etc.

I can't speak for other countries.)

I'll have to begin by answering the obvious problem of critiquing the performance of teachers. Alongside this performance-based pay, would be the removal of student assessment by teachers. Typical daily assignments would be graded by the teachers, but tests would be administered and graded by a third party. This would create an unbiased view of student achievement which teachers would then be reviewed against. The better the grades students get, the more the teacher gets paid.

The current structure of teachers' performance reviews and pay is severely broken. Pay is based solely on seniority and not ability. Reviews are done by administration, and I've heard first hand that it is more to a teacher's benefit to be on good terms with the principal for a good review than it is to actually be doing a good job.

I'm tired of our schools doing an inadequate job of educating people, and teachers having no incentive to do a good job.

So, please, CMV and tell me why the status quo is an acceptable approach to education.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the thoughtful discussion. I have to step away from this thread for a little while, and get some other things done. I'll return to it later, probably tomorrow. I think everyone can agree there are problems with the status quo, but there is no easy solution.

* individual purchase and consumption of recreational drugs (provided one does not hurt anyone else due to the effects)

* prostitution and/or soliciting for prostitution
public nudity or fornication (providing there are no witnesses that have not consented)

* the consumption of pornography (not involving coercion)

* depiction of cartoon child porn (not involving harm to actual children)

* sexting between minors (voluntary action)

* the absence of a seatbelt in a car 

I'm not saying the Government should condone the use of drugs, prostitution, or not wearing a seatbelt. What I *am* saying is I don't believe the government should have any say in what people do to themselves assuming it doesn't harm anyone, it isn't their job to make things they don't like illegal. If Someone wants to do meth, I don't think its the governments job to detain them. If someone decides they are willing to be a prostitute to make money, or a minor wants to sext their partner I really don't think the government has any reason to step in and punish them. The war on drugs (in the US at least) has been a huge failure, not only has it failed to dramatically lower instance of drug abuse but it has also put hundreds of thousands of Americans in the prison system. Minors have unregulated access to pretty much any illegal drug, more so than alcohol and tabacco which are regulated. 

I believe the government should regulate drugs, and prostitution. But aside from that people should have unregulated freedoms assuming they aren't hurting anyone.

2803_B,t3_1bjaaz,1,1,1,0,Slaughtermatic,okay so heres my understanding of the issue everybody is born either male or female and this is your sex but whether you are a man or a woman is a an issue of identity and is independent of your sex that is one can be born a male but later on in her life realize that she identifies with women and women traits and thus decide to identify as a woman she would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns start wearing girl clothes practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine may or may not get genitalchest surgery andor hormones and then she would be a girl and do girl thingshere is where i have the problem what are girl traits what are girl things i have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and nondiscrimination i dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race orientation etc and as such i dont consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine and i think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits arewhen did we decide what traits are what is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl or a boy for that matter what if youresensitive or something then youre a girl im a pretty sensitive guy and i can tell you theres all sorts of things that i do that other people would consider girly but the thing is i think people are full of bullshit i mean i dont really care if people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns i would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldnt correct them its just i dont get it to me assigning certain traits to a gender and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seemsbackwards it seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles like if youre a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresseswell wearing dresses doesnt really help you identify as a girl does it all you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl all wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look thats not about how you perceive yourself its about how you want society to perceive youlike when you tell me youre a girlwell great i just learned nothing significant about you at all that doesnt give me room to presume anything about you it gives me no information so why is it such an important identity to so many people ,"Okay, so here's my understanding of the issue. Everybody is born either male or female, and this is your sex, but whether you are a man or a woman is a an issue of identity, and is independent of your sex. 

That is, one can be born a male, but later on in her life, realize that she identifies with women and women traits, and thus decide to identify as a woman. She would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns, start wearing girl clothes, practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine, may or may not get genital/chest surgery and/or hormones, and then, she would be a girl, and do girl things.

Here is where I have the problem. What are ""Girl traits""? What are ""Girl things""? 

I have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and non-discrimination. I dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race, orientation, etc., and as such, **I don't consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine**. And I think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits are.

When did we decide what traits are? What is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl? Or a boy for that matter? What, if you're...sensitive or something, then you're a girl? I'm a pretty sensitive guy! And I can tell you, there's ALL SORTS of things that I do that other people would consider ""Girly"". But the thing is, I think people are full of bullshit. I mean, I don't really *care*. If people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns, I would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldn't correct them. 

It's just, I don't get it. To me, assigning certain traits to a gender, and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seems...backwards. It seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles. Like, if you're a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresses...well, wearing dresses doesn't really help you identify as a girl, does it? All you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl. All wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look. That's not about how you perceive yourself, it's about how you want society to perceive *you*.

Like, when you tell me you're a girl...well, great, I just learned nothing significant about you at all. That doesn't give me room to presume anything about you, it gives me no information. So why is it such an important identity to so many people? ","okay, so here's my understanding of the issue. everybody is born either male or female, and this is your sex, but whether you are a man or a woman is a an issue of identity, and is independent of your sex. 

that is, one can be born a male, but later on in her life, realize that she identifies with women and women traits, and thus decide to identify as a woman. she would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns, start wearing girl clothes, practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine, may or may not get genital/chest surgery and/or hormones, and then, she would be a girl, and do girl things.

here is where i have the problem. what are ""girl traits""? what are ""girl things""? 

i have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and non-discrimination. i dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race, orientation, etc., and as such, **i don't consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine**. and i think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits are.

when did we decide what traits are? what is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl? or a boy for that matter? what, if you're...sensitive or something, then you're a girl? i'm a pretty sensitive guy! and i can tell you, there's all sorts of things that i do that other people would consider ""girly"". but the thing is, i think people are full of bullshit. i mean, i don't really *care*. if people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns, i would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldn't correct them. 

it's just, i don't get it. to me, assigning certain traits to a gender, and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seems...backwards. it seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles. like, if you're a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresses...well, wearing dresses doesn't really help you identify as a girl, does it? all you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl. all wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look. that's not about how you perceive yourself, it's about how you want society to perceive *you*.

like, when you tell me you're a girl...well, great, i just learned nothing significant about you at all. that doesn't give me room to presume anything about you, it gives me no information. so why is it such an important identity to so many people?

I have problems with arguments that I hear for both moral absolutism and moral relativism; I side with relativism for my own reasons.

On the side of moral absolutism, I hear a lot of emotional arguments based on the arguers' fear and moral outrage. Of course, that isn't rational. Sometimes, they'll point to God, but even if I believed in God, how would his moral beliefs not be preferences rather than facts? Other times, they'll say that all human societies agree on at least some things, but consensus can't make something true. The entire human species could believe that the earth is flat, but it would still be round.

In favor of moral relativism, people argue that not all societies have the same moral standards. I personally find it hard to believe that all societies don't agree at least on some things, but regardless, this argument still supports the irrational notion that consensus can make something true. Many moral relativists also believe that we shouldn't judge the behaviors of other societies, which makes no sense to me. Why not judge societies just because they have different moral standards? We already judge individuals who have different standards. Are international matters a no-thinking zone?

I believe that morality is relative because it is not completely logical. I can prove to you that 3 + 4 = 7 with marbles. I can prove to you that there's a moon by pointing at it. I can prove to you that ""was it a car or a cat I saw"" is a palindrome by having you read it backwards.

Morality doesn't work like this; it builds off of emotionally-based premises such as ""life is precious"" or ""pain is bad."" Even if there was a god, his or her morality wouldn't be factual. 

Moral values are preferences rather than facts. No amount of anxiety or rage can make something a fact. If moral values cannot be facts, then how can morality be absolute?

God.

Fact 2: He also believes he is God's spokesperson on Earth, and as such, he should believe he is entitled to some sort of attention by the worshiped being.

Fact 3: Yet, he does not believe such being will protect him against a shot, hence using a manmade material to grant him that protection.

That's also valid for a number of other issues as well, like the use of medicine, for instance. If he believes that God has a masterplan, then his disease must be in those plans, and to look for treatment is a denial of God's will.

Even if the spokesperson part is wrong, isn't it a lack of faith that he doesn't think God would intervene for him?

I'm talking about the Pope because he, theoretically, has a deeper connection to the Catholic god.

Please, reddit, show me where I'm wrong :)

/u/chicagofirefifa2 [presented](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqwjop) a theoretical possibility of God and evil existing in the same world and thus rendering the Pope's action necessary.

My view has been changed in the way of understanding how the pope, in his catholic belief, would make sense of such contradictory behaviors (1. God will provide, but 2. Just in case He doesn't I'll take care of myself). 

But the Catholic understanding still leaves a lot of open questions. Apart from my original post (which is already resolved), I think our wonderful debate still leaves unanswered the questions of 

1. how moral can an omnipotent Being be if He allows harm to be done within his creation (specially when the answer of ""respecting free will"" is so fickled in sight of the pain those free creatures actually cause. And there's the question about accidents and natural disasters...);

2. how could free will and omniscience exist in the same world (and also how does God's will fit in a world of human will supremacy, as people argued).

But I think those are topics for another CMV. 

Thanks a lot, guys. You were amazing!","fact 1: the pope believes in an all powerful being, a.k.a. god.

fact 2: he also believes he is god's spokesperson on earth, and as such, he should believe he is entitled to some sort of attention by the worshiped being.

fact 3: yet, he does not believe such being will protect him against a shot, hence using a manmade material to grant him that protection.

that's also valid for a number of other issues as well, like the use of medicine, for instance. if he believes that god has a masterplan, then his disease must be in those plans, and to look for treatment is a denial of god's will.

even if the spokesperson part is wrong, isn't it a lack of faith that he doesn't think god would intervene for him?

i'm talking about the pope because he, theoretically, has a deeper connection to the catholic god.

please, reddit, show me where i'm wrong :)

edit: so i think my view has been changed.

/u/gekko_the_great [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqk0tn) there are practical reasons that force the pope to use such car.

plenty of immigrants who carpool to grocery shop none of these solutions are elegant but i have seem plenty of people make it work change my view,"I have been hearing a lot on the news about how $29 dollars a week for food is very difficult to live on and you can not feed yourself nutritiously for that amount. I strongly disagree with this position as I have lived for $25 when I was saving for graduate school. I actually ate healthier and lost over 20lbs fat during the process (I worked out a lot during this time also). 

I came from an immigrant background and it is not uncommon to know families that support themselves on a budget of 100-150 dollar budget for food every month. The trick is learning how to shop and how to cook. With a budget of $29/week or about $116 a month, I have seen families of 3 feed themselves (though they did work hard to make that money stretch). I believe that $29 dollars a week is plenty of money to live off of for food and the complaint is baseless. 

Here are some sample prices of groceries I purchased regularly. Taking advantage of seasonal flux in food prices can help you reduce your food costs even further. 

Starch:

20lb bag of rice - $15-20 dollars (depending on the quality) This has a higher initial cost but it ends up evening out throughout time. If you can not bare the up front cost initially, smaller bags of rice could easily be found for about 1 dollar per pound at walmart. a 20lb bag of rice lasts me about 1.5-2 months.

Pasta -~$1/lb Walmart usually has pasta at about a dollar a pound (if not more). 

Potato - ~ $.2-$.5 a pound. You can easily find a 10lb bag of potato between $2-$2.5. When they are in season, I have seen them for as low as $.5 for a 10 pound bag. 

Ramen - about 10-25 cents per bag. I tried to stay away from ramen as much as I can since they are pretty unhealthy but if you are tired and just want a quick meal, ramen gets the job done. 

Bread - $1 per loaf at walmart/aldi 

cereal - $4 for a giant bag of generic brand cereal at walmart. Those usually lasts me at least 2-3 weeks. 

Protein

whole chicken: between $1-$1.5/lb. Walmart and Aldi usually have them in a pack of 2 for 6-8 dollars. I usually buy two per week. 

Pork Shoulders: usually between $1-$2/lb. Other parts of the pig often go on sale for below $2/lb so shop as you see fit. 

Kielbasa/smoked sausage - Usually $2/lb

ground pork/turkey - ~$2.5/lb

Whole Turkey - $1-$2/lb when not in season. I usually buy 1-2 turkey right after thanksgiving when they go on sale for around $.5/lb and freeze them. Then I roast the turkey, break it down and use the meat for sandwich meat. I make stock/soups from the bones/skin/fat/left over bits. 

Beans - ~ $1-1.5/lb, a good source of protein fiber and starch. It is also absolutely delicious if you cook them right.

Eggs - ~$.15/egg. I usually buy them in huge packs of 48. They end up costing around 6-7 dollars per pack and the pack usually lasts me the month. 

Tofu - $.5-$1/lb I usually purchase tofu in Asian markets and they are usually about 1 dollar pack. I can't remember the exact size of the package but they are at least 1lb. 

Peanut Butter - $2-$3 for a huge jar. Even cheaper if you buy the industrial size ones. 


Veggies

Here is the part that gets slightly trickier. I really like veggies and I also use a lot of Asian veggies that are not as accessible for much of the population. I also take advantage of my local farmer's market and really pay attention to what veggies are in season. the price flux on veggies are hard to predict for country so these are just general estimates for the prices. For the sake of argument, I will stick to veggies that are common throughout the US. 


Onions -  $.5-.75/lb you can find onions easily enough at any super market for about 2-3 dollars for a bag. Depending on the season and your location, I seen them for as little as $1/5lb bag. When onions are on sale like that I usually buy a lot and freeze them. 

Cucumber - $.25-$.5/cucumber 

Zucchini/squash - $.25-$.5 per unit. I usually only buy these when they are in season. You can usually get a nice variety during the summer, often for even cheaper. 

Tomatoes - ~ $1-$1.5/lb. You can find them for incredibly cheap during the summers. I have walked away from a box (estimating between 12-15lbs) for $7.5. Usually if I find them cheap, I make tomato sauce with them. [A really simple but amazing recipe is just butter, onion, and tomatoes](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce). The recipe is by Marcella Hazan (picture Julia Child of Italian cooking) and it tastes absolutely amazing. When I first the recipe, I was very very hesitant and did not think it would taste good at all but it ended up being one of the best tomato sauces I have ever tried. You can freeze/can the sauce to save for later. 

Peppers - I usually go to mexican/asian markets for peppers. They usually sell by the pound and you can usually get 3-4 green or red peppers for about a dollar. I also use tons of jalapenos and 1 dollar will get you a huge bag in those markets. 

Carrots - easily found all year round for &lt;$1 a pound. 

Eggplant - once again, I usually only buy these in season but they usually go for about $2-3 per box (I am guessing around $1/lb). 

Lettuce - $1/head I usually don't eat that much lettuce but they can be found cheaply.

Corn - $.1/-$.25/ear Once again, keep it seasonable. 

Herbs - I usually pick up cilantro, scallion, ginger, and garlic at the mexican/asian markets. They tend to be significantly cheaper. Once again, I understand not everyone have access to these. Cilantro - $.5/bunch; Scallion usually $1 for 2-4 bunches; ginger - I honestly can't remember but i usually never pay over a dollar for it and it lasts me several weeks; garlic - a bundle of 5 goes for about $1. 

Fruits

I unfortunately am not a big fruit eater so I don't have too much info on this...

I understand there are issues such as some mexican/asian stores doesn't accept food stamps, I shop at farmer's markets sometimes and they definitely do not accept food stamps, but vast majority of my shopping came from aldi/walmart so I think these prices are realistic. Additionally, I also understand food prices different from city to city, I have only really lived in medium size cities (largest being Boston) so I don't know if my experiences can be applied to NYC, LA, SF, and places like that. Lastly, if you are using cash, you can negotiate prices with vendors at farmer's markets. Especially if you wait until the market is about to be closed, a lot of vendors are willing to sell you what they have left at a ridiculously low price (I have literally walked away with boxes and crates full of food for less than 10 dollars). 


Sample Week of Groceries:

(I am reducing the price of some of these from my prices since I wouldn't use the whole container/amount).

2 Chickens - $8

1lb of Rice ~ $.7

1lb of pasta - $1

2lb of potato - $1

Herbs ~ $1

2lb of beans - $2

2lbs of Tofu - $2

Eggs - $1.5

Celery - $1

Peppers - $1

Tomatoes - $2

Cucumbers - $2

Onions - $1

cereal - $1

Milk - $1.5

bread - $1

Peanut Butter - $1

Total: $28.7

With $29 dollars you get ~ 7 pounds of protein from the chicken and tofu. You also get additional protein from PB, eggs, and beans. You'll have ~ 2lbs of cooked rice, a whole loaf of bread, 2lb of potatoes,  &gt;1lb of cooked pasta, and breakfast cereal for your starch. You will also have 4-8 cucumbers, 2-4 bell peppers, ~ 1.5lb of tomatoes, and ~ 2lb of onions for your veggies. 

For breakfast: 

Toast with peanut butter and egg. Cereal if you want a change of pace. 

Lunch/dinner 

Debone the chicken and you are left with 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 wings, 4 drumsticks, and 4 tenders. Rest of the meat and the bones goes into a stock pot with 1/2 the celery, and onions (and possibly some carrots) for chicken soup. With the rest of the meat, you can make chicken salad, pulled chicken, grilled chicken, etc (use your imagination). There are tons of things you can do with tofu and you can make some delicious pasta dishes with the garlic, and tomatoes. Rice and Bean is always a solid option and you can opt out of a chicken for some sausage or pork. 

Concerns and arguments against: 

I understand some states still taxes food (I am not sure if you ever get taxed for food stamps). I know I cut it pretty close to the $29 mark but I honestly think this is way more food than a reasonable person should eat in a week (more than 2lb of food/day from the starches, chicken, and tofu alone). 

I also am operating on a stocked pantry. I know my calculations does not account for this but pantries are stocked over time and it is way to hard to figure out how much veggie oil you'll use/cost for the week. Stocking a pantry also is not very expensive, flour, salt, sugar, pepper, cornmeal, soy sauce, oil, baking soda, etc should not cost more than $20 all together. You can get pretty far with just salt, sugar, pepper, oil, and the herbs I included. You can also slowly stock up your spice collection. Basics such as garlic powder/chili/cayenne/oregano, are all around 2-3 dollars tops and they last a very long time. 

Some people lack the time to properly cook their meals:

I worked two jobs (full time and a part time) while saving for my graduate school. I will usually have at least 1 night/weekend day free. I usually prepare my food for the week that night so I don't have to spend time cooking everyday. 

Food deserts:

This is a pretty legitimate concern. I honestly had no experience with this issue but I have heard plenty about it. For the most part, I had a car so shopping was relatively a simple task. I understand that without transportation, while living in a food desert, getting cheap fresh groceries is an issue. However, I think this is more of a city or community issue that needs to be address rather than the food stamp amount. I also have taken public transportation to grocery shop (it sucks but you do what you have to do). I have also known plenty of immigrants who carpool to grocery shop. None of these solutions are elegant but I have seem plenty of people make it work.

2 chickens - $8

1lb of rice ~ $.7

1lb of pasta - $1

2lb of potato - $1

herbs ~ $1

2lb of beans - $2

2lbs of tofu - $2

eggs - $1.5

celery - $1

peppers - $1

tomatoes - $2

cucumbers - $2

onions - $1

cereal - $1

milk - $1.5

bread - $1

peanut butter - $1

total: $28.7

with $29 dollars you get ~ 7 pounds of protein from the chicken and tofu. you also get additional protein from pb, eggs, and beans. you'll have ~ 2lbs of cooked rice, a whole loaf of bread, 2lb of potatoes,  &gt;1lb of cooked pasta, and breakfast cereal for your starch. you will also have 4-8 cucumbers, 2-4 bell peppers, ~ 1.5lb of tomatoes, and ~ 2lb of onions for your veggies. 

for breakfast: 

toast with peanut butter and egg. cereal if you want a change of pace. 

lunch/dinner 

debone the chicken and you are left with 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 wings, 4 drumsticks, and 4 tenders. rest of the meat and the bones goes into a stock pot with 1/2 the celery, and onions (and possibly some carrots) for chicken soup. with the rest of the meat, you can make chicken salad, pulled chicken, grilled chicken, etc (use your imagination). there are tons of things you can do with tofu and you can make some delicious pasta dishes with the garlic, and tomatoes. rice and bean is always a solid option and you can opt out of a chicken for some sausage or pork. 

concerns and arguments against: 

i understand some states still taxes food (i am not sure if you ever get taxed for food stamps). i know i cut it pretty close to the $29 mark but i honestly think this is way more food than a reasonable person should eat in a week (more than 2lb of food/day from the starches, chicken, and tofu alone). 

i also am operating on a stocked pantry. i know my calculations does not account for this but pantries are stocked over time and it is way to hard to figure out how much veggie oil you'll use/cost for the week. stocking a pantry also is not very expensive, flour, salt, sugar, pepper, cornmeal, soy sauce, oil, baking soda, etc should not cost more than $20 all together. you can get pretty far with just salt, sugar, pepper, oil, and the herbs i included. you can also slowly stock up your spice collection. basics such as garlic powder/chili/cayenne/oregano, are all around 2-3 dollars tops and they last a very long time. 

some people lack the time to properly cook their meals:

i worked two jobs (full time and a part time) while saving for my graduate school. i will usually have at least 1 night/weekend day free. i usually prepare my food for the week that night so i don't have to spend time cooking everyday. 

food deserts:

this is a pretty legitimate concern. i honestly had no experience with this issue but i have heard plenty about it. for the most part, i had a car so shopping was relatively a simple task. i understand that without transportation, while living in a food desert, getting cheap fresh groceries is an issue. however, i think this is more of a city or community issue that needs to be address rather than the food stamp amount. i also have taken public transportation to grocery shop (it sucks but you do what you have to do). i have also known plenty of immigrants who carpool to grocery shop. none of these solutions are elegant but i have seem plenty of people make it work.

She has spent her life trying to raise children with clear thinking and a strong moral core. I respect her more than almost anyone in the world.

She also nearly had a degree in biology, but had to abandon that due to personal crisis at the time.

However... she is a Young Earth Creationist, believes people shouldn't write books where people talk to fay (elves, whisps, etc) to get magic because then they're teaching people to open themselves to demons. She was very afraid of Harry Potter and ate up the supposed satanist connections.

She says I'm too cold in my logic, and that life's greatest things (love and god, etc) are not measurable. She says I only talk like I do about ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" because I haven't experienced spiritual powers of good and evil. And she casts my walking away from the faith as ""being just part of the natural rebellion phase. People realize they had it right when they were children, and come back to god.""

She counters my arguments advocating skepticism in regards to ""spiritual matters"" by this condescending ""well you just haven't experienced it"" crap. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall, there's no conversation when someone just waves it away with a hand.
And so, I don't think I can make any headway trying to debate her because I feel like she'll just dismiss anything that doesn't line up with her view.

You being born in a first-world country is comparable to you gaining access to this buffet because someone lends you the entrance fee. If you refuse to pay taxes, it means that you don't want to pay this entrance fee back. 

""But I am not even eating right now!"". Doesn't matter, you can if you want to. I don't think you are going to refuse emergency services, firemen, or FEMA aid if you are about to need their services. Government is acting as an agent of society to make you pay back what was given to you. You have to acknowledge this debt.

Agreement to anything doesn't play a role. You didn't agree to getting born, nor to dying later on either. Or getting sick, or in an accident.

Your parents decided to sign you up for this buffet. They could have emigrated to Somalia or any other failed state, and you would now enjoy a tax-free life. Or, to stay within the example, to not opt for the buffet. 

Instead, they chose to pay the entrance fee with a loan in your name. Remember, it's your debt. It's incurred for the potential options, not for the actual eating. You are already in the room, any action whatsoever won't change that. You can refuse to contribute, simply by not earning anything. This doesn't change that you have a debt which you still are responsible for paying. If you don't, you are dodging your debt and your responsibility.

If you make a million $ and pay $330,000 of taxes, it's not that someone took your hard-earned money away. Compare with a no-tax situation in a failed state, where you live in a hut in the wilderness. Without all the support you have now and take for granted, you would be able to make maybe $10 / day as the smartest guy, when all others around make $1 / day. 

Not unrealistic for failed states where you don't have to pay taxes. Remember, clay huts with a well. You were able to make an additional $999,700 *only* because you are in the US and not in Somalia. Society is your dormant partner in this business venture and supplied the infrastructure, for this they demand $1 for every $3 you make. Sounds fair, and you need to recognize this partnership.

It's an investment in you from your dormant partner, society, which made all you can achieve possible. Taxes are the payout to your dormant partner, and government acts as a proxy to collect this debt. The debt originates from society. It builds with the generations.

This is way it's justified to tax, and why I feel good doing so. This enables our successors to do the same.

3057_A,t3_30oi71,1,1,1,0,gobears10, section i why is basic income increasingly popular basic income is a policy that has broad support from both the progressive left and libertarian right centerleft economists including paul krugman have endorsed the scheme for various reasons first bi is an effective antipoverty measure bi also reduces inequality by redistributing income from capital to labor perhaps most importantly to some on the left is the notion that bi provides people with freedom leftlibertarian political economist philippe van parijs argues that to be truly free people have to have access to the means that people need for doing what they might want to do bi provides people those means some have made a feminist case for bi philosopher carole pateman writes bi would for the first time provide women with lifelong modest economic independence and security a major reason why it is central to democratizationbasic income particularly in the form of a negative income tax is also popular among the libertarian right with a nit in place much of the welfare state would be obsolete you could get rid of food stamps child nutrition programs public housing cash welfare community development programs medicaid and a host of meanstested welfare programs it would simplify the bureaucracy and get rid of the unemployment trap that occurs under the existing system also basic income advocates on the right want to give people the power and authority to spend money in whatever manner they choose they dislike how the government forces welfare recipients to use their welfare handouts on purchasing food for example benefits are often given inkind rather than in cash precisely because the state doesnt trust welfare recipients to make what it regards as wise choices about how to spend their money university of san diegos matt zwolinski writes a basic income zwolinski continues would change that basic income is conservative and libertarian because it makes individuals responsible for their own livelihoods and flourishing if they make good decisions so be it if they make bad decisions so be it but the government shouldnt force people to use transfer payments in a particular manner conservatives also like basic income because it would allow for less regulations on the marketplace minimum wage laws could be gutted labor union protections could be removed etc social democrats on the left and libertarians on the right often disagree on how to fund a basic income scheme some leftists prefer keeping a progressive tax system in place to redistribute income and lower income inequality however libertarians would prefer a flat tax without any tax brackets one way to the two groups could come together is if they coalesced around a negative income flat tax which is both flat but has a progressive effect appealing to the right and left another possible way to fund the bi scheme is to have a progressive consumption tax supported by individuals on the right and left land value taxes are also supported by the right and left moreover there are also several liberal economists who agree with freemarket economists that capital gains and dividends taxes tax savings and corporate taxation is double taxation so realistically if the right and left came together and had to compromise they would settle on either a negative income flat tax or a progressive consumption tax and possibly a land value tax could be thrown into the mix  section ii automation and unemploymenta big reason why people of all political persuasions are becoming interested in basic income is due to automation some project that structural unemployment due to automation and globalization will dramatically increase over the next several decades and no government in the world has devised a solid plan to deal with this they fear that automation may occur at such a rapid pace that the structure of the economy may fundamentally change in which supply for human labor perpetually exceeds demand therefore we need to decouple humanity from work and transition into a society more based on leisure which keynes predicted would happen eventually essentially its not imperative that we build a human society based on work when so many jobs will be automated and in fact a basic income scheme may be the only way to shoulder such a huge influx of unemployed individuals existing welfare schemes werent designed to deal with extreme levels of unemployment and may be overwhelmed in the future  section iii economizing on human labori think these are excellent points in favor of a basic income scheme however here are my rebuttals i concede that improvements in artificial intelligence and robots will decrease the demand for human labor in the shortterm however i am not convinced that this will necessarily persist in the longterm and dramatically decrease permanent employment levels traditionally innovation and technological improvements have lead to structural unemployment through creative destruction but this was considered a positive development bc human labor could be allocated to new enterprises economizing on human labor would improve the dynamism and efficiency of the macroeconomy retraining people or putting them through higher education has worked in the past and has allocated human labor into new sectors im not convinced that this wont be possible in the future but say technological unemployment does occur that doesnt mean we cant combat if we act quickly mit economists erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafee in their book the second machine age argue that while a basic income would replace the lost income resulting from mass unemployment it wouldnt replace the lost selfworth community engagement healthy values structure and dignity people gain from work they instead argue that we should successfully enable humans to successfully rage against the machines through investing in expanded education and wage subsidies one way to increase the supply of human labor would be to expand the earned income tax credit which kind of acts like a small scale negative income tax but it works alongside other transfers and welfare schemes we could further subsidize human labor paying employers to hire humans instead of robots we could establish a scheme where humans own some of the robots and rent them out to corporations another option is to reduce work hours to accommodate more humans while paying humans a wage subsidy there are many options besides the human workforce will be hollowed out anyway so screw it lets accept that humans wont have to worki disagree with the notion that human beings on a large scale will be able to have meaningful lives in a workfree environment that basic income would provide them work will be fundamental to humans in the foreseeable future moreover say basic income is politically off the table it would be in employers self interest to retain some workers or provide them some means with which to earn a living if there are fewer and fewer people to actually do work there wont be any consumers for the producers employers produce with their robots therefore employers likely will too push for wage subsidies lowered work hours subsidies employment and expanded eitc etc they wouldnt be okay with the status quo bc it harms their profits and moreover automation will vastly increase supply helping create an abundance of goods and services moving our society closer toward postscarcity as a result prices for good and services will be pretty low so workers wont need as high wages to consume them  section iv why conditional cash transfers beat unconditional basic incomei also argue that it actually makes sense to have targeted welfare programs food stamps conditional cashtransfers child nutrition programs public housing maternity and paternity care sick leave policies collective bargaining free college singlepayer healthcare etc and i would like to see such a welfare scheme funded through a progressive income tax system under which capital gains is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income in addition to corporate taxes and property taxes i oppose the progressive consumption

can be considered regressive in that the burden is disproportionately felt by lower income families necessities such as expenses for food clothing and shelter tend to make make up a higher percentage of a lower income consumers overall budget true this can be mitigated by allowing a rebate on purchases of necessities since the value of money is still inversely related to income however the system would continue to be unequal a rebate would just be a bandaid fix also in practice many of the flat tax proposals by conservative politicians dont treat income equally yes they may have a flat rate on

corporations pay a corporate tax first and then investors pay a dividends tax on dividend payouts from a theoretical perspective it all makes sense to eliminate capital gains and dividends taxes because theoretically they discourage savings however this theory does not reflect reality and higher capital gains tax rates havent really affected the economy even ronald reagan raised the capital gains tax rate and believed income from labor and investment should be taxed at an equal rate in the real world through a higher capital gains rate you can make a significant dent in income inequality wo many adverse economic effects basically the economic distortions from double taxation that economists warn us about dont have that great of an effect on the real world there is no significant statistical economic relationship between capital gains rates and economic growth refuting aspects of supply side economics also the lower capital gains rate could ironically create economic

oppose scraping the traditional welfare state,"## Section I: Why is Basic Income Increasingly Popular? 

""Basic income"" is a policy that has broad support from both the progressive left and libertarian right. Center-left economists including Paul Krugman have endorsed the scheme for various reasons. First, BI is an effective anti-poverty measure. BI also reduces inequality by redistributing income from capital to labor. Perhaps most importantly to some on the left, is the notion that BI provides people with ""freedom."" Left-libertarian political economist Philippe Van Parijs argues that to be truly free, people have to have ""access to the means that people need for doing what they might want to do."" BI provides people those means. Some have made a feminist case for BI. Philosopher Carole Pateman writes, BI ""would, for the first time, provide women with life-long (modest) economic independence and security, a major reason why it is central to democratization.""

Basic income, particularly in the form of a ""negative income tax,"" is also popular among the libertarian right. With a NIT in place, much of the welfare state would be obsolete: you could get rid of food stamps, child nutrition programs, public housing, cash welfare, community development programs, Medicaid, and a host of means-tested welfare programs. It would simplify the bureaucracy, and get rid of the ""unemployment trap"" that occurs under the existing system. Also, basic income advocates on the right want to give people the power and authority to spend money in whatever manner they choose: they dislike how the government forces welfare recipients to use their welfare handouts on purchasing food, for example. ""Benefits are often given in-kind rather than in cash precisely because the state doesn’t trust welfare recipients to make what it regards as wise choices about how to spend their money,"" University of San Diego's Matt Zwolinski writes. A basic income, Zwolinski continues, would change that. Basic income is ""conservative"" and ""libertarian"" because it makes individuals responsible for their own livelihoods and flourishing. If they make good decisions, so be it, if they make bad decisions, so be it. But the government shouldn't force people to use transfer payments in a particular manner. Conservatives also like ""basic income"" because it would allow for less regulations on the marketplace: minimum wage laws could be gutted, labor union protections could be removed, etc. 

Social democrats (on the left) and libertarians (on the right) often disagree on how to fund a basic income scheme. Some leftists prefer keeping a progressive tax system in place to redistribute income and lower income inequality. However, libertarians would prefer a ""flat"" tax without any tax brackets. One way to the two groups could come together is if they coalesced around a ""negative income flat tax,"" which is both flat but has a progressive effect, appealing to the right and left. Another possible way to fund the BI scheme is to have a ""progressive consumption tax,"" supported by individuals on the right and left. ""Land value taxes"" are also supported by the right and left. Moreover, there are also several liberal economists who agree with free-market economists that capital gains and dividends taxes tax savings, and corporate taxation is double taxation. So realistically, if the right and left came together, and had to compromise, they would settle on either a ""negative income flat tax"" or a ""progressive consumption tax."" (And possibly a land value tax could be thrown into the mix). 

## Section II: Automation and Unemployment

A big reason why people of all political persuasions are becoming interested in basic income is due to automation. Some project that structural unemployment due to automation and globalization will dramatically increase over the next several decades, and no government in the world has devised a solid plan to deal with this. They fear that automation may occur at such a rapid pace that the structure of the economy may fundamentally change, in which supply for human labor perpetually exceeds demand. Therefore, we need to decouple humanity from work, and transition into a society more based on leisure (which Keynes predicted would happen eventually). 

Essentially, it's not imperative that we build a human society based on work when so many jobs will be automated. And in fact, a basic income scheme may be the only way to shoulder such a huge influx of unemployed individuals. Existing welfare schemes weren't designed to deal with extreme levels of unemployment, and may be overwhelmed in the future. 

## Section III: Economizing on Human Labor

I think these are excellent points in favor of a basic income scheme. However, here are my rebuttals. 

I concede that improvements in artificial intelligence and robots will decrease the demand for human labor in the short-term. However, I am not convinced that this will necessarily persist in the long-term and dramatically decrease permanent employment levels. Traditionally, innovation and technological improvements have lead to structural unemployment through creative destruction. But this was considered a positive development b/c human labor could be allocated to new enterprises. Economizing on human labor would improve the dynamism and efficiency of the macroeconomy. Retraining people or putting them through higher education has worked in the past, and has allocated human labor into new sectors. I'm not convinced that this won't be possible in the future. 

But say technological unemployment does occur. That doesn't mean we can't combat if we act quickly. MIT economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, in their book The Second Machine Age, argue that while a basic income would replace the lost income resulting from mass unemployment, it wouldn't replace the lost ""self-worth, community, engagement, healthy values, structure, and dignity"" people gain from work. They instead argue that we should successfully enable humans to successfully ""rage against"" the machines through investing in expanded education and wage subsidies. One way to increase the supply of human labor would be to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (which kind of acts like a small scale negative income tax, but it works alongside other transfers and welfare schemes). We could further subsidize human labor, paying employers to hire humans instead of robots. We could establish a scheme where humans own some of the robots, and rent them out to corporations. Another option is to reduce work hours to accommodate more humans, while paying humans a wage subsidy. There are many options besides ""the human workforce will be hollowed out anyway, so screw it, let's accept that humans won't have to work.""

I disagree with the notion that human beings on a large scale will be able to have meaningful lives in a ""work-free"" environment that basic income would provide them. Work will be fundamental to humans in the foreseeable future. 

Moreover, say basic income is politically off the table. It would be in employers' self interest to retain some workers, or provide them some means with which to earn a living. If there are fewer and fewer people to actually do work, there won't be any consumers for the producers employers produce with their robots. Therefore, employers likely will too push for wage subsidies, lowered work hours, subsidies employment, and expanded EITC, etc. They wouldn't be okay with the status quo b/c it harms their profits. And moreover, automation will vastly increase supply, helping create an abundance of goods and services, moving our society closer toward post-scarcity. As a result, prices for good and services will be pretty low, so workers won't need as high wages to consume them. 

## Section IV: Why Conditional Cash Transfers Beat Unconditional Basic Income

I also argue that it actually makes sense to have targeted welfare programs: food stamps, conditional cash-transfers, child nutrition programs, public housing, maternity and paternity care, sick leave policies, collective bargaining, free college, single-payer healthcare, etc. And I would like to see such a welfare scheme funded through a progressive income tax system (under which capital gains is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income), in addition to corporate taxes, and property taxes. I oppose the progressive consumption tax, a flat tax, and a land value tax.  

Food stamps, SNAP benefits, other forms of welfare and social security are all a necessity because you cannot have a system that relies on the rational actions of its participants. People will act irrationally: they will not spend their basic income in a way that guarantees their well-being, and society will incur enormous costs as a result in homelessness, food insecurity, crime, and drug abuse. Behavioral economics has shown that humans aren't rational actors: rather they have ""bounded rationality: ""bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the time available to make the decision."" In cases where humans naturally make optimal economic decisions, I am in favor of free-markets and against government intervention. In cases where individual economic decisions result in poor outcomes, I am in favor of government intervention to improve outcomes. 

Information failure is a microeconomic market failure in which consumers underconsume or overconsume a good due to imperfect information. Take healthcare for example. For example, take vaccinations. In neoclassical microeconomics, they are viewed as ""merit"" goods that are under-consumed due to information failure. The net private benefit is not fully recognized at the time of consumption. People may not anticipate that they my get sick in the future, and they won't recognize the benefits to their future selves for getting inoculated now. Moreover, inoculation (via vaccines or another method) is a positive externality that has external benefits to society: if you protect yourself, others around you are less likely to become sick. However, when people purchase goods, they don't take into account external benefits or costs, leading to underconsumption. In the market for vaccinations, it makes sense to increase consumer demand for vaccines through mandating people to take vaccines. Such targeted governmental intervention in the market actually improves outcomes, and moves the equilibrium quantity more toward the socially optimal level of consumption.

Moreover, a strong justification for the existence of our Social Security social insurance program is that while some people are rational actors, many others are not. Many don't exercise a lot of foresight: without forcing them to pay payroll taxes to fund Social Security, many people would not have income for themselves after they retire. People may not plan for the future and invest in private sector retirement or pension plan, like a 401k. Social Security a successful anti-poverty and social insurance program that ensures that people have some money after they retire. In this case, social engineering (forcing people to join a government retirement plan) actually improves outcomes in the economy and society through lower poverty and inequality, and greater financial security for elders. 

That's why I support conditional cash transfer programs instead of unconditional basic income. Forcing people to enroll their children in schools, visiting the doctor, and getting vaccinations are successful in overcoming the poverty trap and facilitating upward mobility, more so than UBI. It forces people who would otherwise make bad decisions for themselves and society to make more optimal decisions. 

Proponents of basic income argue that it's better to give people the freedom to use their handouts in whatever way the want, but we can have awareness campaigns educating people on how to improve their spending habits. To BI proponents, sure, recipients may portion their money out in ways that may not be the most reasonable, but given regularly cash they will still make rent and buy food. 

The above is definitely true for a rational actor. But for a drug addict? The mentally ill? Will they spend their basic income on housing and food? Or will their BI disappear and meanwhile the safety net drops out from under them? I would rather have a conditional cash transfer system for such individuals, otherwise society as a whole will incur costs from their poor decisions.  Replacing in kind programs entirely with a BIwould result in some consequences that BI supporters are not considering.  I'm afraid that if the BI did replace public services, businesses would be there to snap up a lot of that money in housing or medical care or whatever else the moment that payday came around. They will be more exploitative for drug addicts than the government. I'm afraid that there ARE people (not poor people or rich people in particular at all) who will act irrationally based on mental illness or drug addiction or something else, who will require the forms of assistance that would be replaced by a BI scheme.

## Section V: Does the Welfare Trap Truly Exist?

Moreover, libertarian supporters of UBI/NIT bring up the ""welfare-trap"" that exists in means tested welfare programs. I did a pretty lengthy search and could find no actual numerical data to confirm that this effect is significant. There are too many conflicting motivations at play, too many demographics, too many differing situations to say for certain our current welfare system turns people into lazy bums who won't seek work. Most welfare recipients today, given the opportunity, would prefer a steady cash income and the opportunity to advance to a stagnant and unproductive life on welfare. They want to look for work. 

## Section VI: Traditional Welfare and Entrepreneurship 

The traditional welfare state has shown to be successful in the social democratic nations of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and to a lesser extent, Canada. They reduce excessive inequality and poverty, while also facilitating upward mobility. People aren't trapped in poverty. Moreover, the traditional welfare state is more efficient than many people claim. The Roosevelt Institute's Mike Konczal argues that in the existing welfare state, ""there are relatively few programs and they are run at a decent administrative cost."" Proponents of BI argue that UBI would facilitate entrepreneurship, [but it's not as if the current welfare schemes that currently exist in the western world discourage start-ups.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/welfare-makes-america-more-entrepreneurial/388598/)

## Section VII: Keynesian Automatic Stabilizers 

From a macroeconomic perspective, many New Keynesian economists believe that transfer payments (unemployment insurance, food stamp payments, Social Security, conditional cash-transfers, etc) help macroeconomic stability by acting as automatic stabilizers. Supporters of UBI often criticize the current welfare scheme on the grounds that costs fluctuate with the performance of the economy. However, fluctuating costs makes sense if you use a Keynesian framework. Higher welfare payouts during recessions help stabilize consumption (and investment via the accelerator effect) during demand-deficient recessions by increasing people's disposable income; during demand-pull inflation, cutbacks in welfare spending decrease people's disposable incomes, which helps close the inflationary gap (when too much money is chasing too few goods). I'm not convinced that UBI would be better to our current welfare scheme with regards to acting as an automatic stabilizer.

## Section VIII: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets

Furthermore, deregulating the marketplace through passing ""right-to-work"" laws and removing minimum wage legislation after BI is passed may worsen outcomes. Even if workers are given an income floor, corporations can still artificially reduce pay in oligopsonistic and monopsonistic markets. Within these imperfect labor market structures, minimum wage laws and collective bargaining laws actually help increase efficiency and equity. 

## Section IX: The Superiority of Progressive Income Taxes

Regarding the funding side, I oppose forgoing our progressive income tax system in favor of a flat tax. Given that income inequality is rising in developed nations due to globalization, automation, and a host of other factors, moving to a flat tax would exacerbate this inequality. A flat tax would shift tax burden away from the rich, to the middle and lower class. It would result in the elimination of deductions may have a positive impact on taxpayers with lower income (such as the EITC). The government wouldn't be able to use tax code to encourage desirable activities, such as giving tax credits for making a home more energy-efficient (energy efficiency is a positive externality with which governments can promote sustainable growth that doesn't lead to environmental degradation). Moreover, government revenues would drastically decrease, making it difficult to fund universal healthcare, free K-12, and a host of other measures.

Proponents say flat taxes don't discriminate based on income level; everyone pays the same percent of income. This argument, however, assumes the marginal benefit of earning a dollar is always the same. To me, it's common sense that the marginal utility of the dollar decreases as income increases. The flat tax isn't regressive in the strictest sense (it's not as if the tax RATE is being increased as you go down the income-ladder). but it can be considered regressive in that the burden is disproportionately felt by lower income families. Necessities, such as expenses for food, clothing, and shelter tend to make make up a higher percentage of a lower income consumer's overall budget. True, this can be mitigated by allowing a rebate on purchases of necessities; since the value of money is still inversely related to income however, the system would continue to be unequal. A rebate would just be a band-aid fix. 

Also in practice, many of the ""flat tax"" proposals by conservative politicians don't treat income equally. Yes, they may have a flat rate on income taxes. But they would lower or possibly eliminate taxes on investments, such as capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc, that disproportionately benefit the rich. These proposals keep in place loopholes that benefit such top earners.

Given that the ""progressive consumption tax scheme,"" another tax scheme favored by BI proponents, would also invariably lower or eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc., I'm opposed to that too. Some economists oppose capital gains taxes, asserting that they are a tax on savings. We're engaging in ""double taxation."" People already pay tax on their income, and then they invest some of their savings into stocks, bonds, etc. Then when they sell their assets for a profit, they pay an additional tax on that. Dividends taxes are also double taxation (corporations pay a corporate tax first and then investors pay a dividends tax on dividend payouts). From a theoretical perspective, it all makes sense to eliminate capital gains and dividends taxes, because theoretically, they discourage savings. 

However, this theory does not reflect reality, and higher capital gains tax rates haven't really affected the economy. Even Ronald Reagan raised the capital gains tax rate, and believed income from labor and investment should be taxed at an equal rate. In the real world, through a higher capital gains rate, you can make a significant dent in income inequality w/o many adverse economic effects. Basically, the economic distortions from ""double taxation"" that economists warn us about don't have that great of an effect on the real world. There is no significant statistical economic relationship between capital gains rates and economic growth (refuting aspects of supply side economics). 

Also the lower capital gains rate could ironically create economic distortions itself: [""The enormous tax savings available likely lure too many highly productive people into the private equity business, drawing them away from other potentially more socially valuable enterprises.""] (http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8226915/rubio-lee-tax-plan)

A ""progressive consumption tax,"" while superior to a flat tax (and less regressive), is inferior to a progressive income tax. The PCT would almost assuredly increase wealthy inequality: since wealthy would be consuming less and investing more, they'd  grow their net wealth even faster than the current pace. This is an unintended effect of the PCT, which would tax consumption and would incentivize savings. Given that automation will increase wealth inequality, it doesn't seem like a good idea to me to exacerbate the trend by gutting capital gains taxes and adopting the PCT. Proponents of the PCT argue that progressive income taxes discourage work due to high marginal rates, but the actual extent to which these market distortions occur in the real world are exaggerated a lot. Even if we had strong inheritance taxes to counteract wealth inequality, a PCT is inferior to a PIT, because with the latter, the government can still use the  tax code to encourage desirable activities. Progressive income taxes also protect taxpayer during hard times - when income goes down, the tax rate also goes down
As I said, I don't believe that human beings are always rational, so social engineering in certain instances can improve outcomes. 

Finally, I oppose the land value tax, another tax scheme favored by many BI opponents, and I instead support the traditional property tax. A land value tax would exacerbate economic inequality. If property taxes were were only based on the value of the land, rich people would buy small lots in cheap areas, build massive mansions worth millions, and pay almost no taxes.Then the working class people who buy small homes on small lots in the city (where dirt is worth more) would be paying more in taxes.

I support a progressive tax system because I'm of the belief that you should pay what you can. If you can afford an expensive house, you can afford to pay taxes on the value of the house, including the improvements built on that house. 

## Section X: Conclusion

I believe an unconditional basic income scheme, including in all of its flavors (negative income tax, citizen's dividend, demogrant, social wage, etc.) is ultimately a pretty flawed scheme. I view the traditional western social safety net as superior. For the reasons above, I feel that it's better for society to expand the traditional social safety net rather than dismantle it completely and replace with a UBI or NIT scheme. I support basic income in addition to the existing scheme (like how the EITC works alongside other tax credits and welfare programs), but I oppose scraping the traditional welfare state.","## section i: why is basic income increasingly popular? 

""basic income"" is a policy that has broad support from both the progressive left and libertarian right. center-left economists including paul krugman have endorsed the scheme for various reasons. first, bi is an effective anti-poverty measure. bi also reduces inequality by redistributing income from capital to labor. perhaps most importantly to some on the left, is the notion that bi provides people with ""freedom."" left-libertarian political economist philippe van parijs argues that to be truly free, people have to have ""access to the means that people need for doing what they might want to do."" bi provides people those means. some have made a feminist case for bi. philosopher carole pateman writes, bi ""would, for the first time, provide women with life-long (modest) economic independence and security, a major reason why it is central to democratization.""

basic income, particularly in the form of a ""negative income tax,"" is also popular among the libertarian right. with a nit in place, much of the welfare state would be obsolete: you could get rid of food stamps, child nutrition programs, public housing, cash welfare, community development programs, medicaid, and a host of means-tested welfare programs. it would simplify the bureaucracy, and get rid of the ""unemployment trap"" that occurs under the existing system. also, basic income advocates on the right want to give people the power and authority to spend money in whatever manner they choose: they dislike how the government forces welfare recipients to use their welfare handouts on purchasing food, for example. ""benefits are often given in-kind rather than in cash precisely because the state doesn’t trust welfare recipients to make what it regards as wise choices about how to spend their money,"" university of san diego's matt zwolinski writes. a basic income, zwolinski continues, would change that. basic income is ""conservative"" and ""libertarian"" because it makes individuals responsible for their own livelihoods and flourishing. if they make good decisions, so be it, if they make bad decisions, so be it. but the government shouldn't force people to use transfer payments in a particular manner. conservatives also like ""basic income"" because it would allow for less regulations on the marketplace: minimum wage laws could be gutted, labor union protections could be removed, etc. 

social democrats (on the left) and libertarians (on the right) often disagree on how to fund a basic income scheme. some leftists prefer keeping a progressive tax system in place to redistribute income and lower income inequality. however, libertarians would prefer a ""flat"" tax without any tax brackets. one way to the two groups could come together is if they coalesced around a ""negative income flat tax,"" which is both flat but has a progressive effect, appealing to the right and left. another possible way to fund the bi scheme is to have a ""progressive consumption tax,"" supported by individuals on the right and left. ""land value taxes"" are also supported by the right and left. moreover, there are also several liberal economists who agree with free-market economists that capital gains and dividends taxes tax savings, and corporate taxation is double taxation. so realistically, if the right and left came together, and had to compromise, they would settle on either a ""negative income flat tax"" or a ""progressive consumption tax."" (and possibly a land value tax could be thrown into the mix). 

## section ii: automation and unemployment

a big reason why people of all political persuasions are becoming interested in basic income is due to automation. some project that structural unemployment due to automation and globalization will dramatically increase over the next several decades, and no government in the world has devised a solid plan to deal with this. they fear that automation may occur at such a rapid pace that the structure of the economy may fundamentally change, in which supply for human labor perpetually exceeds demand. therefore, we need to decouple humanity from work, and transition into a society more based on leisure (which keynes predicted would happen eventually). 

essentially, it's not imperative that we build a human society based on work when so many jobs will be automated. and in fact, a basic income scheme may be the only way to shoulder such a huge influx of unemployed individuals. existing welfare schemes weren't designed to deal with extreme levels of unemployment, and may be overwhelmed in the future. 

## section iii: economizing on human labor

i think these are excellent points in favor of a basic income scheme. however, here are my rebuttals. 

i concede that improvements in artificial intelligence and robots will decrease the demand for human labor in the short-term. however, i am not convinced that this will necessarily persist in the long-term and dramatically decrease permanent employment levels. traditionally, innovation and technological improvements have lead to structural unemployment through creative destruction. but this was considered a positive development b/c human labor could be allocated to new enterprises. economizing on human labor would improve the dynamism and efficiency of the macroeconomy. retraining people or putting them through higher education has worked in the past, and has allocated human labor into new sectors. i'm not convinced that this won't be possible in the future. 

but say technological unemployment does occur. that doesn't mean we can't combat if we act quickly. mit economists erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafee, in their book the second machine age, argue that while a basic income would replace the lost income resulting from mass unemployment, it wouldn't replace the lost ""self-worth, community, engagement, healthy values, structure, and dignity"" people gain from work. they instead argue that we should successfully enable humans to successfully ""rage against"" the machines through investing in expanded education and wage subsidies. one way to increase the supply of human labor would be to expand the earned income tax credit (which kind of acts like a small scale negative income tax, but it works alongside other transfers and welfare schemes). we could further subsidize human labor, paying employers to hire humans instead of robots. we could establish a scheme where humans own some of the robots, and rent them out to corporations. another option is to reduce work hours to accommodate more humans, while paying humans a wage subsidy. there are many options besides ""the human workforce will be hollowed out anyway, so screw it, let's accept that humans won't have to work.""

i disagree with the notion that human beings on a large scale will be able to have meaningful lives in a ""work-free"" environment that basic income would provide them. work will be fundamental to humans in the foreseeable future. 

moreover, say basic income is politically off the table. it would be in employers' self interest to retain some workers, or provide them some means with which to earn a living. if there are fewer and fewer people to actually do work, there won't be any consumers for the producers employers produce with their robots. therefore, employers likely will too push for wage subsidies, lowered work hours, subsidies employment, and expanded eitc, etc. they wouldn't be okay with the status quo b/c it harms their profits. and moreover, automation will vastly increase supply, helping create an abundance of goods and services, moving our society closer toward post-scarcity. as a result, prices for good and services will be pretty low, so workers won't need as high wages to consume them. 

## section iv: why conditional cash transfers beat unconditional basic income

i also argue that it actually makes sense to have targeted welfare programs: food stamps, conditional cash-transfers, child nutrition programs, public housing, maternity and paternity care, sick leave policies, collective bargaining, free college, single-payer healthcare, etc. and i would like to see such a welfare scheme funded through a progressive income tax system (under which capital gains is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income), in addition to corporate taxes, and property taxes. i oppose the progressive consumption tax, a flat tax, and a land value tax.  

food stamps, snap benefits, other forms of welfare and social security are all a necessity because you cannot have a system that relies on the rational actions of its participants. people will act irrationally: they will not spend their basic income in a way that guarantees their well-being, and society will incur enormous costs as a result in homelessness, food insecurity, crime, and drug abuse. behavioral economics has shown that humans aren't rational actors: rather they have ""bounded rationality: ""bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the time available to make the decision."" in cases where humans naturally make optimal economic decisions, i am in favor of free-markets and against government intervention. in cases where individual economic decisions result in poor outcomes, i am in favor of government intervention to improve outcomes. 

information failure is a microeconomic market failure in which consumers underconsume or overconsume a good due to imperfect information. take healthcare for example. for example, take vaccinations. in neoclassical microeconomics, they are viewed as ""merit"" goods that are under-consumed due to information failure. the net private benefit is not fully recognized at the time of consumption. people may not anticipate that they my get sick in the future, and they won't recognize the benefits to their future selves for getting inoculated now. moreover, inoculation (via vaccines or another method) is a positive externality that has external benefits to society: if you protect yourself, others around you are less likely to become sick. however, when people purchase goods, they don't take into account external benefits or costs, leading to underconsumption. in the market for vaccinations, it makes sense to increase consumer demand for vaccines through mandating people to take vaccines. such targeted governmental intervention in the market actually improves outcomes, and moves the equilibrium quantity more toward the socially optimal level of consumption.

moreover, a strong justification for the existence of our social security social insurance program is that while some people are rational actors, many others are not. many don't exercise a lot of foresight: without forcing them to pay payroll taxes to fund social security, many people would not have income for themselves after they retire. people may not plan for the future and invest in private sector retirement or pension plan, like a 401k. social security a successful anti-poverty and social insurance program that ensures that people have some money after they retire. in this case, social engineering (forcing people to join a government retirement plan) actually improves outcomes in the economy and society through lower poverty and inequality, and greater financial security for elders. 

that's why i support conditional cash transfer programs instead of unconditional basic income. forcing people to enroll their children in schools, visiting the doctor, and getting vaccinations are successful in overcoming the poverty trap and facilitating upward mobility, more so than ubi. it forces people who would otherwise make bad decisions for themselves and society to make more optimal decisions. 

proponents of basic income argue that it's better to give people the freedom to use their handouts in whatever way the want, but we can have awareness campaigns educating people on how to improve their spending habits. to bi proponents, sure, recipients may portion their money out in ways that may not be the most reasonable, but given regularly cash they will still make rent and buy food. 

the above is definitely true for a rational actor. but for a drug addict? the mentally ill? will they spend their basic income on housing and food? or will their bi disappear and meanwhile the safety net drops out from under them? i would rather have a conditional cash transfer system for such individuals, otherwise society as a whole will incur costs from their poor decisions.  replacing in kind programs entirely with a biwould result in some consequences that bi supporters are not considering.  i'm afraid that if the bi did replace public services, businesses would be there to snap up a lot of that money in housing or medical care or whatever else the moment that payday came around. they will be more exploitative for drug addicts than the government. i'm afraid that there are people (not poor people or rich people in particular at all) who will act irrationally based on mental illness or drug addiction or something else, who will require the forms of assistance that would be replaced by a bi scheme.

## section v: does the welfare trap truly exist?

moreover, libertarian supporters of ubi/nit bring up the ""welfare-trap"" that exists in means tested welfare programs. i did a pretty lengthy search and could find no actual numerical data to confirm that this effect is significant. there are too many conflicting motivations at play, too many demographics, too many differing situations to say for certain our current welfare system turns people into lazy bums who won't seek work. most welfare recipients today, given the opportunity, would prefer a steady cash income and the opportunity to advance to a stagnant and unproductive life on welfare. they want to look for work. 

## section vi: traditional welfare and entrepreneurship 

the traditional welfare state has shown to be successful in the social democratic nations of sweden, norway, denmark, and to a lesser extent, canada. they reduce excessive inequality and poverty, while also facilitating upward mobility. people aren't trapped in poverty. moreover, the traditional welfare state is more efficient than many people claim. the roosevelt institute's mike konczal argues that in the existing welfare state, ""there are relatively few programs and they are run at a decent administrative cost."" proponents of bi argue that ubi would facilitate entrepreneurship, [but it's not as if the current welfare schemes that currently exist in the western world discourage start-ups.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/welfare-makes-america-more-entrepreneurial/388598/)

## section vii: keynesian automatic stabilizers 

from a macroeconomic perspective, many new keynesian economists believe that transfer payments (unemployment insurance, food stamp payments, social security, conditional cash-transfers, etc) help macroeconomic stability by acting as automatic stabilizers. supporters of ubi often criticize the current welfare scheme on the grounds that costs fluctuate with the performance of the economy. however, fluctuating costs makes sense if you use a keynesian framework. higher welfare payouts during recessions help stabilize consumption (and investment via the accelerator effect) during demand-deficient recessions by increasing people's disposable income; during demand-pull inflation, cutbacks in welfare spending decrease people's disposable incomes, which helps close the inflationary gap (when too much money is chasing too few goods). i'm not convinced that ubi would be better to our current welfare scheme with regards to acting as an automatic stabilizer.

## section viii: imperfect competition in labor markets

furthermore, deregulating the marketplace through passing ""right-to-work"" laws and removing minimum wage legislation after bi is passed may worsen outcomes. even if workers are given an income floor, corporations can still artificially reduce pay in oligopsonistic and monopsonistic markets. within these imperfect labor market structures, minimum wage laws and collective bargaining laws actually help increase efficiency and equity. 

## section ix: the superiority of progressive income taxes

regarding the funding side, i oppose forgoing our progressive income tax system in favor of a flat tax. given that income inequality is rising in developed nations due to globalization, automation, and a host of other factors, moving to a flat tax would exacerbate this inequality. a flat tax would shift tax burden away from the rich, to the middle and lower class. it would result in the elimination of deductions may have a positive impact on taxpayers with lower income (such as the eitc). the government wouldn't be able to use tax code to encourage desirable activities, such as giving tax credits for making a home more energy-efficient (energy efficiency is a positive externality with which governments can promote sustainable growth that doesn't lead to environmental degradation). moreover, government revenues would drastically decrease, making it difficult to fund universal healthcare, free k-12, and a host of other measures.

proponents say flat taxes don't discriminate based on income level; everyone pays the same percent of income. this argument, however, assumes the marginal benefit of earning a dollar is always the same. to me, it's common sense that the marginal utility of the dollar decreases as income increases. the flat tax isn't regressive in the strictest sense (it's not as if the tax rate is being increased as you go down the income-ladder). but it can be considered regressive in that the burden is disproportionately felt by lower income families. necessities, such as expenses for food, clothing, and shelter tend to make make up a higher percentage of a lower income consumer's overall budget. true, this can be mitigated by allowing a rebate on purchases of necessities; since the value of money is still inversely related to income however, the system would continue to be unequal. a rebate would just be a band-aid fix. 

also in practice, many of the ""flat tax"" proposals by conservative politicians don't treat income equally. yes, they may have a flat rate on income taxes. but they would lower or possibly eliminate taxes on investments, such as capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc, that disproportionately benefit the rich. these proposals keep in place loopholes that benefit such top earners.

given that the ""progressive consumption tax scheme,"" another tax scheme favored by bi proponents, would also invariably lower or eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc., i'm opposed to that too. some economists oppose capital gains taxes, asserting that they are a tax on savings. we're engaging in ""double taxation."" people already pay tax on their income, and then they invest some of their savings into stocks, bonds, etc. then when they sell their assets for a profit, they pay an additional tax on that. dividends taxes are also double taxation (corporations pay a corporate tax first and then investors pay a dividends tax on dividend payouts). from a theoretical perspective, it all makes sense to eliminate capital gains and dividends taxes, because theoretically, they discourage savings. 

however, this theory does not reflect reality, and higher capital gains tax rates haven't really affected the economy. even ronald reagan raised the capital gains tax rate, and believed income from labor and investment should be taxed at an equal rate. in the real world, through a higher capital gains rate, you can make a significant dent in income inequality w/o many adverse economic effects. basically, the economic distortions from ""double taxation"" that economists warn us about don't have that great of an effect on the real world. there is no significant statistical economic relationship between capital gains rates and economic growth (refuting aspects of supply side economics). 

also the lower capital gains rate could ironically create economic distortions itself: [""the enormous tax savings available likely lure too many highly productive people into the private equity business, drawing them away from other potentially more socially valuable enterprises.""] (http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8226915/rubio-lee-tax-plan)

a ""progressive consumption tax,"" while superior to a flat tax (and less regressive), is inferior to a progressive income tax. the pct would almost assuredly increase wealthy inequality: since wealthy would be consuming less and investing more, they'd  grow their net wealth even faster than the current pace. this is an unintended effect of the pct, which would tax consumption and would incentivize savings. given that automation will increase wealth inequality, it doesn't seem like a good idea to me to exacerbate the trend by gutting capital gains taxes and adopting the pct. proponents of the pct argue that progressive income taxes discourage work due to high marginal rates, but the actual extent to which these market distortions occur in the real world are exaggerated a lot. even if we had strong inheritance taxes to counteract wealth inequality, a pct is inferior to a pit, because with the latter, the government can still use the  tax code to encourage desirable activities. progressive income taxes also protect taxpayer during hard times - when income goes down, the tax rate also goes down
as i said, i don't believe that human beings are always rational, so social engineering in certain instances can improve outcomes. 

finally, i oppose the land value tax, another tax scheme favored by many bi opponents, and i instead support the traditional property tax. a land value tax would exacerbate economic inequality. if property taxes were were only based on the value of the land, rich people would buy small lots in cheap areas, build massive mansions worth millions, and pay almost no taxes.then the working class people who buy small homes on small lots in the city (where dirt is worth more) would be paying more in taxes.

i support a progressive tax system because i'm of the belief that you should pay what you can. if you can afford an expensive house, you can afford to pay taxes on the value of the house, including the improvements built on that house. 

## section x: conclusion

i believe an unconditional basic income scheme, including in all of its flavors (negative income tax, citizen's dividend, demogrant, social wage, etc.) is ultimately a pretty flawed scheme. i view the traditional western social safety net as superior. for the reasons above, i feel that it's better for society to expand the traditional social safety net rather than dismantle it completely and replace with a ubi or nit scheme. i support basic income in addition to the existing scheme (like how the eitc works alongside other tax credits and welfare programs), but i oppose scraping the traditional welfare state.",0.4285255372524261,0.0171266570687294,0.554347813129425,3569,22302,1,22.738131829924104,1.7320093829521965,82,5,12,185,27,136,34,122,98,7,0,53,1,0,24,3,1,1,30,109,168,77,74,202,82,33,382,1,30,22,219,136,1,380,317,103,14,11,3,81,60,360,0,250,123,275,529,414,14,12,11,301,16,1334,4,5,0,0.2998038666293079,0.010647240123283833,657,2.9378881046325866,8.297619047619047,1,0.4123978215876947,0.10426503735364502,1.896273095194791,1.5051115285073315,7.668482737929665,difficult,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,14,0,2,0,17,32,0,0,0,5,0,0,47,0,145,0,0,48,118,0,213,10,0,12,4,1,6,1,5,1,2,4325,5.991226993865031,43,2,0,0,0,0,42,55,0,0,24,0,0.5068227978280485,0.508422486428527,0.4894221744920628

my parents live in another city 500 miles away. my brother is at least an hour drive away. my other brother is in another city as well; sometimes visiting our city. most of my friends live at least an hour drive away from myself as well. although i don't think it would be so much different if they were a lot closer. what i'd like to say here is in order to meet the demands of closeness i'd need to sacrifice so much of my time.

i spend most of my time working. when i'm not working i'm with my girlfriend most of the time. i spend the rest at home alone by myself; reading, watching tv series, educational youtube channels, or ted in my spare time when i'm not with my girlfriend. i also work at home on my side projects that i'd like to pursue. i believe these are making me strong, pushing me towards, making me a better person day by day and i feel good about living the way i do.

according to my priorities; i want to have a strong and healthy relationship with the love of my life whom i want to spend rest of my life with and i should accomplish things that i'd like to in my personal life.

therefore i spend my time accordingly. leaving too little to the rest. i understand when other people do that. i don't bug them about it. i believe people should respect that and shouldn't take it personally and weaken the relationship. 

this definitely doesn't mean that i don't love my brothers. this doesn't mean i don't like to spend time with my friends. this just means our lives are separate from each other. however our relationship is still strong even though we might be apart.

note that i feel that there is something wrong with my belief here. i don't know what and i'm happy to learn if there is. if there is anything that i can change about my behavior on this matter it starts with believing in it first. so there you go; change my view.",0.0296159107238054,0.55677729845047,0.4136067628860473,383,1961,1,1.6486408778155155,1.6556692245391147,10,1,3,22,1,17,8,9,23,0,0,11,0,0,6,2,0,6,2,13,20,13,3,41,5,1,54,2,0,1,39,25,2,7,5,6,0,30,2,14,10,54,6,16,15,40,63,52,4,5,2,25,26,186,0,2,0,0.46736292428198434,0.12532637075718014,29,0.14810209769887192,2.6714285714285713,0,0.5083953680727875,0.16081378299120236,-0.36341414874823963,-0.6386343236581955,5.190602141157811,medium,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,4,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,29,1,0,11,6,0,19,1,0,2,7,0,0,1,0,0,1,447,5.8196,2,0,0,0,0,0,7,9,0,0,0,0,0.13733261127432372,0.2777412737488111,0.6457467704375273

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that ""Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options"".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (""Massage parlors""). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

**What I would not like to see:**

-Outright moral arguments (""Selling your body is wrong"", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions (""Women will be forced into sex slavery"")

-Religious arguments

Thanks for your time :3

&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Speaking of which,* ***[downvotes don't change views](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/guidelines#wiki_upvoting.2Fdownvoting)****!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","i've been thinking about this one for a while. while a lot of the arguments for it (""it's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies"") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(as a side note, i'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**

one of the most oft-touted arguments that i seem to see is that ""women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options"".

i fail to see this as a legitimate concern. not because i don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because i don't see how this is a bad thing. if the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? starvation? homelessness? while it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

if i argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? i don't think so. a mcjob is a mcjob, and a mcblowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. one could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. the only argument i could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which i concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, i'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

* ""So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.""  

* ""Hillary says she has a plan for restarting the Israel-Palestine peace process, but so far nobody has been able to nail her down on the details."" 

* Recently right here on one of the CMV posts about Bernie Sanders, /u/bayernownz1995 says that ""Sanders *does* have a solid page on racial injustice on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.""

You hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. 

But the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. 

Secondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?"" 

If you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a ""liar,"" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.

So that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? 

**EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it? I got a lot of deltas burning a hole in my pocket here....**

you hear these complaints all. the. time. in newspapers, on blogs, on tv news, in debates, etc. candidate x offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. it's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. 

but the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. for one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. if someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. and all for what? for an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. no candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. 

secondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. whether someone is running for president, senate, congress, governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. they have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. so if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in washington (or any other capital). oh, you promised you were going to cut the f-22 fighter? well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. and you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? how about f--k you?"" 

if you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a ""liar,"" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.

so that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? 

**edit -- after 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. for instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? did they pay for it or benefit from it? i got a lot of deltas burning a hole in my pocket here....**

You're saying he should face decades of imprisonment for what he's done... now think about that, really. We throw around punishment very severely in our society, but really think about what you're saying. If you lock him up for 20 years, he'll get out when he's 37; for 30 and he'll be 47; for 40 and he'll be 57 years old. We're talking about a child's life here. Granted, what he did is undoubtedly wrong, and I cannot imagine being a victim, having a SWAT team in full gear and weaponry busting down your family's door has to be one of the scariest experiences I can think of. That said, this is still a 17 year old child. A moron really, if only by age. Can you imagine the person you were 10 years ago, and how different you were? Or the person you were in high school? This is just some idiot kid who thought he was pranking people. Put him away for 5 years, that's still a massive amount of time, but when he gets out you'll more than likely have someone who is truly sorry. If you don't let him out until he's in his 30's or 40's, you have effectively destroyed his entire life. He'll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he's already got this criminal record, he'll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult... Sometimes I think we lock some people away for far too long and don't actually think about what it would have to be like sitting in a room for so many hundreds or thousands of days.

responses to the police murders of black citizens people trying to find a reason why the person was shot and we see it with victims of rape people say you shouldnt have been so drunk or you shouldnt have been in that area of town there are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who dont deserve it we like to think of our world as just in some way so we come up with reasons why these people deserved what they got people rarely go so far as to say a woman deserved to be raped but theres a certain amount of otherization and lack of empathy that goes on  a sense that well that wouldnt have happened to me because

im not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept i understand that its very complex and of course many factors go into a certain outcome i am well aware of probabilistic models

point itself was actually that explaining causation is not victim blaming and this view has not been addressed sufficiently ive changed my view to the point that i dont think explaining causation is always the appropriate response particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault i do still think its often important to explain causation before the fact as some users have suggested as an alternative simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take most specifically no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs justification one person has said theyre the same thing but not really offered an explanation for that at any rate ive enjoyed reading the responses so far im aware this is a sensitive issue and im glad discussions have remained

wikihttp:/wwwredditcomrchangemyviewwikipopulartopics first any questions or concerns feel free to message ushttp:/wwwredditcommessagecomposetorchangemyview happy cmving,"I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not ""blaming"" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a ""worthwhile endeavor"" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and ""explaining causation"" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as ""part 1"" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term ""causation"" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that ""avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged"", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that ""explaining causation is not victim blaming"", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think ""explaining causation"" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

I believe this is nonsense. Based on what a person is wearing, how they present them-self, their body language, and a bit of intellect, you can come to a conclusion or estimate on that persons personality. I'm not saying you can completely figure out someone based on their appearance but for sure you can get the ""brief summary"" of their life, how they behave or personality. Some people are easier to read than others but every little tattoo, piercing, shirt wrinkle, hairstyle, piece of clothing (the list could continue on forever), could definitely be interpenetrated  to show a little characteristic about a person and who they really are.

This development got me thinking since a lot of people I know think that being able to control fire is (no pun intended) hot shit I Began to think that controlling ice would be much better; reasons ?



Ice only needs water or any liquid to be made so as long as I have anything that has any liquid at on such as nearly every place on earth I can make ice, this is not the same with fire which needs oxygen so If I froze the person in a very compact ice shell the person wouldn't be able to create fire since they would waste all the oxygen and I would just keep reinforcing the shell so 1v1 the ice wins

Second profit: I can freeze time and walk into a bank freeze the vault and then sledgehammer bam no vault door I would be able to see all the lasers due to the mist from the ice so I can dodge lasers and bam I am a billionaire who did it with style. 


Third I would never pay for gas or ships or anything since I can freeze everything I would just sit down in my nice comfortable chair and have an ice dragon which I would make(it's no alive but it pushes me) to take me anywhere.


4th I would be amazing at places where people want cold or cooler temperature If I see a very attractive girl saying gosh I wish it was colder BAM ice man over here I can do that for you and chill the area down like 15 or so degrees that's a guaranteed hello at least also your cooler ran out of ice don't worry BAM cold beers, who is the savior of the alcohol this guy. 


5th personal use: since I would be controlling it I would get used to cold temperatures so when it gets cold to winter guess who gets to go outside shirtless and in shorts since I would be used to the cold


There are obviously more reasons that I will bring up later if asked (I don't know them yet but I will eventually)
So people who would are boring

I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal, but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that ""sex with another person = relationship over"" that I don't think hold up.

 * **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

 * **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases, but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. 

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. CMV!

Claim: Intelligent Design and the Big Bang theory explain this phenomenon with the same basic foundation.

ID says: There is some intelligent being who exists outside of our understanding of time. He has no beginning and no end. He created the Universe.

BB says: At some moment, all matter in the universe was contained in one single point. The Big Bang took place causing this matter to expand and marked the beginning of the Universe.

This matter must have always existed, because based on the laws of science matter cannot be created. In other words, all matter in the universe must have no beginning and no end.

Rain on a wedding day would be an example of situational irony because many women plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control.  Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl.  The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality.  

The guy who is in the plane crash says ""well isn't this nice"" (verbal irony).  Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence, and it is the first plane trip he ever went on, but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality (situational irony).  I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying, so it is not ironic for him, but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe.  

A traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess.  

10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife.  the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable, but that expectation is challenged by reality (situational irony).  

The free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the character's buying of one ride (situational irony).  

Meeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic (but nonetheless present) movie magic fantasy of falling in love.  This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife.  This is cosmic or situational irony.  The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive.  When the universe torpedoes that expected reality, you have cosmic irony.

The most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck.  To that I say that there are many instances of bad timing or bad luck that create ironic situations.  Irony, timing, and luck are not mutually exclusive factors in any described event.

A less common rebuttal I hear is that I am seeing more than what is there.  According to this argument, irony must be tacky and cranked up to eleven.  I disagree.  Subtle irony is irony too.  Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry.  I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium (pop music).

The final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well.

the final rebuttal i am familiar with is that morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well.  her admission needs to be taken into context.  it was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.  she was very smart to not double-down in the face of such criticism.",0.0532851889729499,0.413818746805191,0.532896101474762,522,2998,1,2.803415883015454,3.959335647873119,18,5,0,32,3,19,2,12,25,1,14,9,0,0,0,4,1,1,1,17,23,11,8,48,6,13,53,1,3,1,53,31,0,1,3,15,4,0,1,15,18,71,0,33,27,54,97,52,2,10,8,34,2,243,3,1,0,0.46551724137931033,0.022988505747126436,135,1.9163398692810456,2.673755656108597,1,0.596804256349711,0.10778203614567253,-0.22933574457843545,1.1486678290909142,7.481897701149426,difficult,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,34,4,0,9,41,0,21,5,0,8,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,613,6.0843243243243235,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,2,0,0,6,0,0.560683568010421,0.45934448744927664,0.199828047364063

Overpopulated areas have more crime in general and also require more policing. So you got 100 cops making 200 arrests in an area that's 85% black. And you got 10 cops making 20 arrests in an area that's 15% black. There are obviously going to be more black people arrested overall. It has nothing to do with racial profiling. NOW I DO AGREE THAT IT STILL DOES HAPPEN FROM TIME TO TIME. YOU WILL HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS RACIST OR RACIAL PROFILING, BUT ITS A SMALL MINORITY AND NOT THIS WIDESPREAD ISSUE. It is just that the single issues are blown out of proportion and turned into nation wide news. I know of many issues of police vs whites that don't even make headlines in the newspaper.

I can't stand large amount of foods, I can't even touch some, I just find it disgusting. My parents tried to force me to eat them for many years, but whenever they did, I refused.

Here’s a blurb from Wikipedia:
&gt;In 1978, the Addington v. Texas set the bar for involuntary commitment for treatment by raising the burden of proof required to commit persons from the usual civil burden of proof of ""preponderance of the evidence"" to the higher standard of ""clear and convincing"" evidence.[24]
&gt;An example of involuntary commitment procedures is the Baker Act used in Florida. Under this law, a person may be committed only if they present a danger to themselves or others.
I have committed people before, and the rules about this process are universal as far as I know.  You seem to be under the impression that I can just snap my fingers and the person will be held for for 72 hours (or indefinitely).  The reality is that you need clear and convicing evidence that someone is a harm to themselves and others, and there are specific criteria for that, which involves a clinical interview (remember P.I.M.P - Previous attempts, Ideations, Means, Plan).  You must meet these criteria (not necessarily all 4, but usually the ‘IMP’ part) in order to even get a 72-hour hold.  In those 72-hours, TWO different professionals formally evaluate the person, in addition to the other staff and professionals who may offer their observations to the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrists will often follow up with family/friends (assuming the individual grants permission) in order to get information from as many sources as possible.  In the counties around me, I don’t even get to make the decision really – the hospitals all have a crisis intervention team who actually evaluates the person when they show up to the hospital (before they are ever committed).  They will take my opinion into account, but I have little say in whether or not the hospital agrees that they are dangerous enough to stay.  I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard of people getting to the hospital, regaining some control/composure/having the feelings pass, and then being sent home.","second, your assertion that “and that it only takes the word of a psychologist to cause such a hold,” is outright wrong.  here’s a blurb from wikipedia:

Clearly, there are more purchasers of corporate goods than voters for any single government. A corporation can sell to all 50 states but a state government only has voters from that state. The US Federal government excludes anyone under 18, many felons, and non-citizens. By contrast, travelers, teenagers, non-citizen immigrants, and even people half-a-world away can participate in corporations either through purchasing power or through owning shares. So it would seem that in this sense, corporations give power to a wider group of individuals than governments. But is that a good thing? What if the actions of a corporation are negative for only one segment of the population but beneficial to the rest? Major tyranny of the majority! The US system is designed to divide people into polities by geography partly because it gives those people more autonomy than being awash in a mass-majority-rules situation. If there were no state, county, or town governments, 300 millions Americans would vote exactly where to put our uranium waste and wherever it went, those people would just have to deal. So here's an interesting paradox: spreading the power out to more people results in those people being disempowered relative to a smaller government with less participants deciding their actions for themselves. Hmmm. Add on the fact that economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few already, and we start to see that one vote per person matters a lot when calculating the level of power concentration and its impact on decision making.","(2)

Perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points. But I would like to make this point. Governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them. These issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars. There is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that. We must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more, and sometimes it means more regulation not less. I propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed. It is possible that the current US system is failing to facilitate this distribution, it may be the case the the US system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed. But I do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution, not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure (which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism). Therefore, I think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed. In contrast, the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages (violence, economic redistribution, oppression, suppression, etc) but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve (at the behest of the governed) and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed (and the violence of other governments, but that's another story).","i won't go on because i don't have the time. perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points. but i would like to make this point. governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them. these issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars. there is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that. we must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more, and sometimes it means more regulation not less. i propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed. it is possible that the current us system is failing to facilitate this distribution, it may be the case the the us system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed. but i do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution, not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure (which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism). therefore, i think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed. in contrast, the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages (violence, economic redistribution, oppression, suppression, etc) but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve (at the behest of the governed) and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed (and the violence of other governments, but that's another story).",0.4192738533020019,0.0294645614922046,0.5512616634368896,322,1941,1,5.589564264811189,3.1650736408464564,3,0,0,16,5,12,2,16,5,0,0,11,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,12,11,11,1,24,10,2,29,0,4,1,15,17,0,20,7,14,2,0,0,9,12,38,0,30,17,29,67,46,4,0,1,15,4,151,1,0,0,0.5,0.034161490683229816,124,1.646804391930262,4.299670426682622,1,0.5185185185185185,0.10659371492704828,1.736622177076728,1.1277665801003116,7.468333954451346,difficult,0.0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,19,0,0,11,8,0,11,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,355,6.0963157894736835,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,0.4087919356677896,0.24959330092615603,0.7998506886082776

Put him away for 5 years, that's still a massive amount of time, but when he gets out you'll more than likely have someone who is truly sorry.

He'll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he's already got this criminal record, he'll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult...

I disagree with this stance personally. I vote as long as I think I am submitting to a cause I believe is the correct one. In our society, hardly anything most individuals do has a direct influence. To say that what you do does not have an influence on the whole can rationalize a lot of behavior - not behaving ecologically, not voting, throwing specific trash (e.g. medicine, electronics, batteries) to mixed waste etc. Why do you give money to charity? You think these few dollars a month will make a difference? Why do you recycle? You think a few bottles of plastic will make a difference in the billions of tons of plastic waste? Why do you vote? You think one vote will change the functioning of the country? All these come down to excusing and rationalizing not doing something to feel better. To me, that is sloth. Not voting because you don't think it's worth your time is intellectual sloth in my eyes, as long as you bring arguments that hold no water (which you did). If someone has a reason for not voting that seems legit, e.g. travel distance for a very old man that is unable to walk, personal ideology etc., it does not seem like sloth to me. Not voting because you think you can't change the world anyway is sloth, even if you think of a post hoc argument about it not being worth your time. You are arguing for an individualistic stance in a very, very socially determinent culture. If you think you personally will make a difference in anything, it's time to open your eyes.

That's not just sloth, that is also selfish.","does your vote have to make a difference for it to be worth your time? i disagree with this stance personally. i vote as long as i think i am submitting to a cause i believe is the correct one. in our society, hardly anything most individuals do has a direct influence. to say that what you do does not have an influence on the whole can rationalize a lot of behavior - not behaving ecologically, not voting, throwing specific trash (e.g. medicine, electronics, batteries) to mixed waste etc. why do you give money to charity? you think these few dollars a month will make a difference? why do you recycle? you think a few bottles of plastic will make a difference in the billions of tons of plastic waste? why do you vote? you think one vote will change the functioning of the country? all these come down to excusing and rationalizing not doing something to feel better. to me, that is sloth. not voting because you don't think it's worth your time is intellectual sloth in my eyes, as long as you bring arguments that hold no water (which you did). if someone has a reason for not voting that seems legit, e.g. travel distance for a very old man that is unable to walk, personal ideology etc., it does not seem like sloth to me. not voting because you think you can't change the world anyway is sloth, even if you think of a post hoc argument about it not being worth your time. you are arguing for an individualistic stance in a very, very socially determinent culture. if you think you personally will make a difference in anything, it's time to open your eyes. you might as well not do anything to benefit the society as long as it does not benefit you directly. that's not just sloth, that is also selfish.",0.2255233973264694,0.0936111658811569,0.6808654069900513,315,1664,1,5.476852406802759,2.4162141249924445,1,1,0,12,2,4,4,2,9,0,0,13,0,0,1,2,2,0,2,12,7,15,5,45,5,1,28,0,1,0,34,22,0,0,6,14,3,3,1,12,13,54,0,22,9,35,58,36,1,4,18,22,4,153,1,7,0,0.473015873015873,0.02857142857142857,62,0.6111111111111112,0.7,1,0.3224904214559387,0.006072796934865892,0.6125330368284251,,5.812462987341772,medium,7.2388e-05,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,23,1,0,15,12,0,9,3,0,23,2,0,0,0,4,3,1,366,5.170625,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,1.0000000000000002,1.0000000000000002,-2.220446049250313e-16

dp815p0,dp815p0_1,xiipaoc,"I think all sexual preferences are wrong.  Also, all of them are right.
First, you're attracted to what you're attracted to.  If you're only attracted to black people or gay women or people with big belly buttons, that's what it is.  The problem is when you *categorically* dismiss anything not in that list, and that's when it becomes racist/transphobic/weightist/whatever.  I think it's wrong to categorically state that people with such-and-such characteristics are not dateable, but it's perfectly fine to simply never be interested in that same set of people.  Basically, if I don't find you attractive, it's not because there's something inferior or wrong about you; rather, I'm just not attracted.  ""Oh, sorry, I don't date people who are ____.""  Bad.  ""Oh, sorry, I'm not attracted to you personally.""  Not bad."
dp815p0,dp83n5i_1,riderecho,"I disagree. Attempts to dictate what is okay and what is not when it comes to sexual preferences seems ridiculous to me.
For example, say there is a woman who is somewhat attracted to men, but she considers herself a gay woman, and categorically writes men off because they are men. Is that wrong? Does it lower the written-off person's value?"
dp815p0,dp83n5i_2,riderecho,"I would argue that it doesn't. To me, it seems that there is an issue of conflating ""these people are not dateable"" (by anyone) and ""these people are not dateable"" (by me).
For example, I will not date a Nazi. The individual Nazi may be highly attractive to me sexually, but a Nazi is ""not dateable"" to me. In my opinion, this is okay, but saying that Nazis are ""not dateable"" to anyone is the demeaning part."
dp815p0,dp8ayhj_1,p_iynx,"Nazism is a choice. Being black, transgender, etc, is not. And when we are talking protected classes, it’s often based in racist/transphobic/etc societal norms.
It’s okay to have never been attracted so far to, say, a a Native American person. But it becomes a very odd and nearly impossible to prove statement when you say you don’t find any native people attractive at all. Because you haven’t met all native people, and we don’t all look or act the same. It’s generalizing to a degree that is unnecessarily discriminatory and limiting. If you met a person that was gorgeous to you, had an amazing personality, had the same values, was sexually compatible with you, and you *decided* to not date them based solely on their race, that *is* racism. It doesn’t mean you’re evil or horribly wrong or anything. It just means that your sexual preferences are being impacted by racism/discrimination. If I said “I don’t want to be friends with any white men,” that would be pretty shitty and discriminatory of me, because there are many white guys out there that could be amazing friends for me."
dp815p0,dp8ayhj_2,p_iynx,"Saying “I’m generally not attracted to native people” is fine because you’re allowing space for the fact that there may in fact be a native person that would be a good fit for you. It’s acknowledging that, while there are **general traits** that are commonly found in native people that you aren’t attracted to, you aren’t discriminating solely on race. Do you see the difference? I know it’s subtle and doesn’t seem important, but it is the key difference between racist/transphobic/discriminatory preferences and non-problematic sexual preferences."
dp815p0,dp8b8t6,Loliberals2020,"Being mentally retarded isnt a choice, does it make you abelist if you refuse to have sex with a retarded person?"
dp815p0,dp8z33y,cheertina,"If you're attracted to someone, date them, sleep with them, and are happy with all those choices, and then you find out they're dyslexic and suddenly you're not interested, I would absolutely call you ableist."
3046_A,t3_30uf3s,llbad,"""I used to own a galaxy s2, and currently own a galaxy s4.  My upgrade is almost up, but I see no reason to go with an s6.  

-The difference in performance was noticeable, but on a cost/performance basis it was negligible.  

-I do not see the purpose in the increasingly large resolutions coming to the market.  1440 x 2560, the s6 resolution, is simply unnecessary.  ***EDIT: it seems I was wrong here***

-The upgraded camera features, sensors, etc. are nice, but the number of megapixels has reached its peak, and anyone else who truly cares about the rest will use the $500+ or whatever to actually get themselves a real camera.  

-Many of the nifty little features added to newer versions of cell phones can already be added to old phones, given that the user is even slightly capable of leveraging the app store and/or android community.  I would assume the same can be said of Apple products, but am not as familiar with them.  

I can see significant technological progress being noticeable in the long run, but for now, unless you are coming from a smartphone that is 5+ years old, upgrading to the newest smartphones on the market is a waste of money. Battery life and durability should be the focus of demand from consumers.  Yet, in regards to the s6, battery life is regressing (non-removable, thus cant be replaced as it degrades over time), waterproofing was removed, and even storage is now becoming non-removable.  

I should add a caveat to my CMV: I am not interested in playing the latest games on my phone.

d164d22,d164d22,AtomikRadio,"Pro-abortion implies being, well, *for* abortion.

They are, in fact, pro-choice and not pro-abortion. They don't *want* people to have abortions, they want people to have the right to make the *choice*."
d164d22,d164s76,elcuban27,"But there is a lot less room for confusion about ""pro-abortion"" meaning that they want to force people to get more abortions than ""pro-choice"" meaning any choice other than choosing to abort.  The use of ""pro-choice"" is intentional to obfuscate the issue."

e6ciwm3,e6ciwm3_1,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; I have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the Ford/Kavanaugh situation.
Potential corroborating evidence:"
e6ciwm3,e6ciwm3_2,VeryStableGenius,"* The WaPost has seen therapist records from 2012 in which Ford discussed this assault.  This strongly demonsrates this story was not concocted to undermine Kavanaugh's SCOTUS nomination.
* Her husband was told in 2012 (this evidence is less useful, because he is a biased witness).
* One other woman at her school said the assault was talked about at the time.  Given time to investigate, more students at the school could be found.  This, again, shows that it pre-dates the time when K became important."
e6ciwm3,e6ciwm3_3,VeryStableGenius,"* K's friend Mark Judge has a history of innuendo, inebriation, and, well, skeeviness.
* Any connected and demonstrated un-truths K says about not knowing the victim, his other activities at the time, etc. impugn his reliability as a witness, as well as constitute potential perjury.
You won't build a 'beyond reasonable doubt' case like in a criminal trial, but if you try you certainly have a good shot at a ""strong weight of the evidence"" case, stronger than a civil case.   And becoming a SCOTUS justice is not a right; it is a privilege extended only to the very best and most ethical."
e6ciwm3,e6ciwm3_4,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; and I believe something happened to her, but I’m of the opinion that allegations are not enough ... I believe she is supremely credible with regard to the claim that something happened to her.
OK, so you *believe* that K perjured himself in front of Congress.  That's a felony.  You believe K is  a felon.  You said it, not me.   Are you 90% certain?  Would you appoint someone who is a felon with 90% certainty to the court?"
e6ciwm3,e6cjudx_1,warrett,"1. It would be amazing to get more evidence. I wasn’t saying none exists or it’s impossible that more will be found, I just have a bad feeling nothing really solid will be revealed.
2. He hasn’t had the chance to address any of this under oath yet so you are wrong about perjury, if any statement he has made so far has in fact been a lie."
e6ciwm3,e6cjudx_2,warrett,"3. It is possible to believe that something happened to Ford but that something didn’t involve Kavanaugh. So the choices you are trying to box me into aren’t my only options.
This woman could be right. She could be misremembering. I hope we get more evidence and can settle this definitely."
e6ciwm3,e6clcvs_1,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; I just have a bad feeling nothing really solid will be revealed.
Therapist notes from 2012 are reasonably solid.  Not ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" but ""strong preponderance of evidence.""       They show that this is not a politically driven claim."
e6ciwm3,e6clcvs_2,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; He hasn’t had the chance to address any of this under oath yet so you are wrong about perjury
OK, you're right here - he issued a statement that ""This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself (last week.)"""
e6ciwm3,e6clcvs_3,VeryStableGenius,"It's not felonious to make a statement like this, even if untrue,  but now he has to repeat it under oath, or in effect confess that this was untrue.
&gt; It is possible to believe that something happened to Ford but that something didn’t involve Kavanaugh.
At that point, you can only be arguing mistaken identity.   That's a fair point, but the problem is that Judge was identified as the co-assaulter, and the two guys were buddies (K was mentioned in J's book of wild times under a thin pseudonym O'Kavanaugh).   And it seems they belonged to the same social set - not many opportunities to mess up.  Taking some time to interview students from the era might help nail down their association, and Ford's statements to them at the time."
e6ciwm3,e6clcvs_4,VeryStableGenius,"Suppose that 1) K is consistent and repeats his claim of innocence under oath (otherwise, he's ineligible for the court); 2) You believe 90% that something happened to F; 3) you think there is a  (implausibly high) 40% chance of mistaken identity, despite them apparently moving in the same social circle.  Then, as a spectator, you'd conclude that there is a 54% chance that K committed a felony of perjury.    You would never vote for a person who has a 54% chance of being a felon to the SCOTUS."
e6ciwm3,e6clcvs_5,VeryStableGenius,"Now you might ask .... how could K (or anyone) ever have a chance against random accusations?  Well, an accusation from a woman who never knew him or never moved in his social circle would be ignored.  An accusation with no past corroborating evidence (therapist notes, witnesses) would have much less value.    An accusation by a person with a history of false accusations or mental illness would be downplayed.  Heck,  George Bush was accused of raping some nutty woman, but it was obvious that she and he had never come into proximity, so it was laughed off except by conspiracy sites."
e6ciwm3,e6csi4d,lefukcos,In the therapist notes she never mentions kavanaugh at all she vaguely mentions she was sexually assaulted by 3 people. Now she is saying Kavanaugh and 1 other person is responsible. To even say this case has strong evidence would be a massive exaggeration. Your other point such as Kav’s friend has a history of inebriation is some of the stupidest attempts at “evidence” I have ever seen. This case has no merit especially since ford refuses to even accuse him under oath and Kavanaugh should be treated as innocent until substantial evidence comes out (which it won’t since it was 30 years ago).
e6ciwm3,e6ctqqw_1,VeryStableGenius,"The [WaPost says](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html)
&gt; The therapist’s notes, portions of which were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students “from an elitist boys’ school” who went on to become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.” The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.
That's not really ""vaguely mentions."""
e6ciwm3,e6ctqqw_2,VeryStableGenius,"It establishes that she claimed a sexual assault in high school at a party by boys from an elite boys' school.    It proves that she isn't making up the assault to attack K politically.
You could come up with less plausible scenarios, like postulating that she took a genuine assault, and changed the culprit for political purposes, but that becomes very implausible."
e6ciwm3,e6ctqqw_3,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; To even say this case has strong evidence would be a massive exaggeration.
There is one witness of good character and professional accomplishment, and corroborating evidence that the crime was recorded before K became a figure of public interest.  The fact that people rarely lie about sexual assault means that is much more likely than not that she is telling the truth."
e6ciwm3,e6ctqqw_4,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; Your other point such as Kav’s friend has a history of inebriation is some of the stupidest attempts at “evidence” I have ever seen.
Read some of the articles of the [school's drug/alcohol/sex scene.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgetown-prep-student-party-culture-kavanaugh_us_5ba28cf7e4b07c23ef37a06c), up to the crotch-injected drug death of RFK's son at a school party he hosted.   It establishes that K was a friend of a self-proclaimed participant in the Georgetown Prep party scene.  It pushes the balance of probabilities further in Ford's direction.  For example, Gorsuch also went to Georgetown, but, in contrast with K, people described him as a straight arrow during his time there."
e6ciwm3,e6ctqqw_5,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; This case has no merit especially since ford refuses to even accuse him under oath
She wants to talk to the FBI, and lying to the FBI is just as illegal as lying under oath.  *Then* she wants to testify under oath."
e6ciwm3,e6ctqqw_6,VeryStableGenius,"&gt;  Kavanaugh should be treated as innocent until substantial evidence comes out
It's not a matter of guilty / innocent.  It's a matter of whether doubts exist as to his character.  Being on the court is privilege for the *demonstrably* ethically immaculate, not a right."
e6ciwm3,e6d3cso_1,khazikani,"Why do you think taking a real assault and changing the culprit is implausible?
I’m totally playing devil’s advocate and not accusing Mrs. Ford of everything, but the legal system is kind of *about* addressing potential alternative explanations.
We can say fairly confidently that Ford and Kavanaugh “moved in the same circles,” as I’ve heard a bunch of times. So ***if*** Ford is a very hardcore liberal (statistically, a psych professor is certainly more likely to be liberal than conservative, at the very least), and she finds a conservative up for nomination to the court. She doesn’t want him there, and he just happens to be someone she made acquaintance with however many decades ago."
e6ciwm3,e6d3cso_2,khazikani,"Lightbulb!
She recalls that she discussed in relatively vague detail an assault that she was subjected to at a young age with a therapist, and that she didn’t specify any names. Given their close proximity to one another during school, the fact that he fits the profile for the perpetrators (as do doubtless hundreds of kids who went there, to be fair), and the lack of names given, it’s totally possible to put Kavanaugh’s name onto one of these nameless, faceless criminals and potentially stop his confirmation."
e6ciwm3,e6d3cso_3,khazikani,"If someone believes hard enough that conservatives are evil and do not deserve power, why hesitate to use *any means possible* to stop him?
Hell, we need not even go *that* far. What if, even if K did *not* assault her, she still feels like his moral character is in question based on *other* experiences with him? Maybe she’s willing to use whatever means necessary to stop someone who isn’t “demonstrably ethically immaculate,” as you say, from being appointed for the foreseeable future?"
e6ciwm3,e6d3cso_4,khazikani,"Absent much other evidence, I don’t see any reason why that is inherently less likely than the easy explanation that he’s a predator.
Obviously it’s a case that requires more looking into, and I agree that it’s imperative that we figure out to the best of our abilities what is true and what is not. I just don’t think that “demonstrably ethically immaculate” is a great standard for this. It’s impossible to demonstrate someone’s “ethically immaculate”; the best you can do is show no marks on their record, so to speak. You’re essentially asking to prove a negative - prove he’s never done anything morally suspect - when you use that standard. I don’t think this applies to Kavanaugh, but that standard could easily mean that an accusation with even *the smallest iota* of credibility could rob the country of one of its best, most capable, upstanding jurists."
e6ciwm3,e6d3cso_5,khazikani,"“Sure, we can’t *show* s/he’s not ethically immaculate, but we’ve brought doubt on it and you can’t demonstrate s/he is!”"
e6ciwm3,e6d3v4s_1,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; Why do you think taking a real assault and changing the culprit is implausible?
Only a very small fraction of people make false accusations of assault.  The likelihood that anyone  *who knows* you (or me, or Kavanaugh) would do this, probably.  Then only a fraction of people were assaulted, so the potential pool of people to commit this swap-eroo is tiny."
e6ciwm3,e6d3v4s_2,VeryStableGenius,"You need a certain improbable level of crazy to concoct an assault, then you need to get get *really really improbable* and have this improbably crazy accuser already have been assaulted by somebody perfectly fitting K's description.
Improbable is approximately the same as implausible.  The simple and more probable explanation is that she's telling the truth."

You're constructing a straw-woman here."
e6ciwm3,e6d4v67_1,khazikani,"&gt;Only a very small fraction...
There’s a very good reason that statistical arguments don’t hold up in court. They’re totally invalid as stand-alone arguments because they don’t *actually* demonstrate anything. You can’t apply it in an individual case because reality isn’t a big dice game where you can say, “Okay, she made a rape accusation, and 99.5% of them are true. Let’s roll the 200-sided die to decide this one!”"
e6ciwm3,e6d4v67_2,khazikani,"The fact that most assault accusations are true (which in itself is questionable - this isn’t exactly an easy thing to confidently figure out statistically-speaking) I’m sure was very comforting to all the people who’ve had to be exonerated years later because of a false accusation, or those people *still in jail* because we haven’t yet figured out they’re innocent."
e6ciwm3,e6d4v67_3,khazikani,"If you were a prosecutor in those cases, would you argue that only a small minority of accusations are lies, and that that should be another reason to convict? What if, 20, 30, 40 years later, the defendant is released because of backlogged DNA evidence that exonerates him - would you stand by that argument? If it were me, I would feel very guilty. I’ve done nothing illegal, but I’d feel as though I’d committed prosecutorial misconduct."
e6ciwm3,e6d4v67_4,khazikani,"The point is that that argument doesn’t actually have any bearing on the likelihood of any particular case being true or false. It’s just an average, really. Even if your average bowling score is 260, there’s still nothing stopping you from throwing eleven gutter-balls. It’s essentially a red herring argument that *pretends* to increase the likelihood of one outcome without actually bringing anything substantive to the table."
e6ciwm3,e6d4v67_5,khazikani,"I mean, *statistically*, I, as a black man, am much more likely to be killed by another black man in this country. So as a prosecutor, would you look at the jury and say “Statistically, it’s much more likely that the defendant committed this murder because he is black, and that makes it *more likely* that he’s guilty than that suspect #2 is guilty.”"
e6ciwm3,e6d4v67_6,khazikani,"I guess you wouldn’t, but from a statistical standpoint, that argument is just as valid as the one you made.
And hell, if I continue to play devil’s advocate, that might make it even more likely; Ford’s a smart social scientist who undoubtedly *knows* this statistic that you’ve given, and she understands psychology, so she knows that statistical arguments can have a lot of power, and that will play into her hand."
e6ciwm3,e6d4v67_7,khazikani,"Again, I don’t know anything about Ford personally, so this isn’t an accusation. But from where I stand, there’s nothing to tip the scales of probability in either direction absent actual substantial evidence. That’s why I think we should focus on that kind of evidence.
&gt;straw-woman
No, because I’m not actually attributing this to her. As I said, it’s an alternative explanation with nothing inherently wrong with it. And by the way, I wrote a second paragraph that had *another* alternative explanation that you didn’t address. It’s not like my scenario hinges on her being a crazy hardcore liberal. She could just be someone who believes that the ends justify the means, I suppose. But again, I don’t know, and I’m not saying that *any* of this is actually true. But we also don’t know that *your* explanation is true."
e6ciwm3,e6d5ndb,VeryStableGenius,"&gt; There’s a very good reason that statistical arguments don’t hold up in court. ... If you were a prosecutor in those cases ...

This isn't a criminal case.  

BTW, 51% is the standard in civil law (preponderance of evidence)."
e6ciwm3,e6d644s_1,khazikani,"It’s also not a civil case. She’s not suing for damages, she’s casting doubt on the morality of a nominee to office. To my knowledge, it’s not an actual *case* at all. It’s a hearing before the senate. There’s no standard of evidence for such a procedure.
But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school, and another important legal guideline is that out-of-court testimony cannot be used to establish the fact of the matter asserted; that is, you can’t use someone’s testimony that “Ford mentioned Kavanaugh by name to me in 2012” to establish that Ford did indeed mention Kavanaugh by name in 2012. It takes more evidence than that, and it’s an objectionable and inadmissible argument. It’s called hearsay. It wouldn’t be hearsay if Ford’s husband actually testified, but in that case it would only be able to be treated as any other witness testimony given by someone with a clear bias."

So, because women did not have to physically fight for the right to vote, they are somehow dodging fighting responsibilities? How can you say this when feminists have worked so hard to allow women to join the military? It's men that have kept women out of the military."

Also funny is how, all the MRA's I see complaining about Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin, none of them seem to care much about their supporting-role, careerless housewives that are afforded one, maybe two episodes per season where they do anything of note, or the near complete absence of familiy TV shows where the wife is a more prominent character than the husband.

d85vi9n,d85zj9e_2,groman28,"&gt;MRAs are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to men, and feminists are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to women.
Except it's false for feminists. Especially with feminists being major supporters of the LGBT movement, their examination of male stereotypes has deepened considerably over the years, and are the first to point out how men are punished when they step outside the roles defined by masculinity (particularly as gay men and trans women do). Again, the treatment of effeminate men, gay men, and trans people in general is something MRA's are oddly silent about."
d85vi9n,d85zj9e_3,groman28,"It's easy to think that maybe MRA's and Feminists are just mirror images of each other, but they're not, not even close. Feminism has a century-old academic tradition that has exposed more of how sexism affects men than anyone else, especially MRA's. It's a natural conclusion from ""femininity isn't bad"" that men who don't fully exhibit so-called ""masculinity"" (e.g. male stereotypes) should not be socially punished. Feminists are also *usually* against gender essentialism, the idea that your sex inherently imbues you with certain characteristics, and so expectations of those characteristics are unfair. Given that MRA's have such a high crossover with TRP, an explicitly gender-essentialist group, their treatment of these issues shouldn't be surprising."

d85vi9n,d86cm12_1,ZeusThunder369,"I think where we disagree is probably on our views of what equality means in this context. My view is that women already have social, political, and economic equality to men.
Firstly, there are no longer any laws in our country that are sexist.
Secondly, whether one is born female or male, that person will have arbitrary burdens and advantages placed upon them simply because of their gender. This happens to both genders, and thus both genders are equal. The inequity only occurs based upon the situation one finds themselves in."

d85vi9n,d86cm12_3,ZeusThunder369,"So to me, when a group is trying to eliminate one aspect of gender roles or double standards that happen to negatively impact just a single gender, they cannot be advocating for equality, rather they are advocating for advancement.

This happens to both genders, and thus both genders are equal. The inequity only occurs based upon the situation one finds themselves in.
This is a false equivalence. You can't just say that gender equality already exists because men and women both have problems. Gender equality isn't a state where both genders are equally subject to social bias, it's a state where neither gender is. The removal of any one destructive effect of gender roles/standards/biases is a step towards equality, it's not promoting inequality because it doesn't somehow annihilate a commensurate amount of bias towards the opposite sex. It's not a zero-sum proposition. Women being less screwed doesn't somehow reduce the stature of men in society."

61_B,t3_2qr8gn,Li54,"""There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal, but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that ""sex with another person = relationship over"" that I don't think hold up.

 * **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

 * **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases, but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. 

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. CMV!

Yes. But ""talking about the problem"" is an ideal situation. It often doesn't work out so well that way. People get stuck in a pattern... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about. Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong."

In my mind, marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. One partner isn't fulfilling all of his/her obligations (i.e. not to cheat) So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his/hers? Why should you stay married?"
61_B,t1_cn9b5po_7,qezler,"It is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do. It's an ethical question, and everyone has their different values, so it's impossible to prove definitively what you should/should not do.

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny.

I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora

3057_A,t3_30oi71,gobears10,"## Section I: Why is Basic Income Increasingly Popular? 

""Basic income"" is a policy that has broad support from both the progressive left and libertarian right. Center-left economists including Paul Krugman have endorsed the scheme for various reasons. First, BI is an effective anti-poverty measure. BI also reduces inequality by redistributing income from capital to labor. Perhaps most importantly to some on the left, is the notion that BI provides people with ""freedom."" Left-libertarian political economist Philippe Van Parijs argues that to be truly free, people have to have ""access to the means that people need for doing what they might want to do."" BI provides people those means. Some have made a feminist case for BI. Philosopher Carole Pateman writes, BI ""would, for the first time, provide women with life-long (modest) economic independence and security, a major reason why it is central to democratization.""

Basic income, particularly in the form of a ""negative income tax,"" is also popular among the libertarian right. With a NIT in place, much of the welfare state would be obsolete: you could get rid of food stamps, child nutrition programs, public housing, cash welfare, community development programs, Medicaid, and a host of means-tested welfare programs. It would simplify the bureaucracy, and get rid of the ""unemployment trap"" that occurs under the existing system. Also, basic income advocates on the right want to give people the power and authority to spend money in whatever manner they choose: they dislike how the government forces welfare recipients to use their welfare handouts on purchasing food, for example. ""Benefits are often given in-kind rather than in cash precisely because the state doesn’t trust welfare recipients to make what it regards as wise choices about how to spend their money,"" University of San Diego's Matt Zwolinski writes. A basic income, Zwolinski continues, would change that. Basic income is ""conservative"" and ""libertarian"" because it makes individuals responsible for their own livelihoods and flourishing. If they make good decisions, so be it, if they make bad decisions, so be it. But the government shouldn't force people to use transfer payments in a particular manner. Conservatives also like ""basic income"" because it would allow for less regulations on the marketplace: minimum wage laws could be gutted, labor union protections could be removed, etc. 

Social democrats (on the left) and libertarians (on the right) often disagree on how to fund a basic income scheme. Some leftists prefer keeping a progressive tax system in place to redistribute income and lower income inequality. However, libertarians would prefer a ""flat"" tax without any tax brackets. One way to the two groups could come together is if they coalesced around a ""negative income flat tax,"" which is both flat but has a progressive effect, appealing to the right and left. Another possible way to fund the BI scheme is to have a ""progressive consumption tax,"" supported by individuals on the right and left. ""Land value taxes"" are also supported by the right and left. Moreover, there are also several liberal economists who agree with free-market economists that capital gains and dividends taxes tax savings, and corporate taxation is double taxation. So realistically, if the right and left came together, and had to compromise, they would settle on either a ""negative income flat tax"" or a ""progressive consumption tax."" (And possibly a land value tax could be thrown into the mix). 

## Section II: Automation and Unemployment

A big reason why people of all political persuasions are becoming interested in basic income is due to automation. Some project that structural unemployment due to automation and globalization will dramatically increase over the next several decades, and no government in the world has devised a solid plan to deal with this. They fear that automation may occur at such a rapid pace that the structure of the economy may fundamentally change, in which supply for human labor perpetually exceeds demand. Therefore, we need to decouple humanity from work, and transition into a society more based on leisure (which Keynes predicted would happen eventually). 

Essentially, it's not imperative that we build a human society based on work when so many jobs will be automated. And in fact, a basic income scheme may be the only way to shoulder such a huge influx of unemployed individuals. Existing welfare schemes weren't designed to deal with extreme levels of unemployment, and may be overwhelmed in the future. 

## Section III: Economizing on Human Labor

I think these are excellent points in favor of a basic income scheme. However, here are my rebuttals. 

I concede that improvements in artificial intelligence and robots will decrease the demand for human labor in the short-term. However, I am not convinced that this will necessarily persist in the long-term and dramatically decrease permanent employment levels. Traditionally, innovation and technological improvements have lead to structural unemployment through creative destruction. But this was considered a positive development b/c human labor could be allocated to new enterprises. Economizing on human labor would improve the dynamism and efficiency of the macroeconomy. Retraining people or putting them through higher education has worked in the past, and has allocated human labor into new sectors. I'm not convinced that this won't be possible in the future. 

But say technological unemployment does occur. That doesn't mean we can't combat if we act quickly. MIT economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, in their book The Second Machine Age, argue that while a basic income would replace the lost income resulting from mass unemployment, it wouldn't replace the lost ""self-worth, community, engagement, healthy values, structure, and dignity"" people gain from work. They instead argue that we should successfully enable humans to successfully ""rage against"" the machines through investing in expanded education and wage subsidies. One way to increase the supply of human labor would be to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (which kind of acts like a small scale negative income tax, but it works alongside other transfers and welfare schemes). We could further subsidize human labor, paying employers to hire humans instead of robots. We could establish a scheme where humans own some of the robots, and rent them out to corporations. Another option is to reduce work hours to accommodate more humans, while paying humans a wage subsidy. There are many options besides ""the human workforce will be hollowed out anyway, so screw it, let's accept that humans won't have to work.""

I disagree with the notion that human beings on a large scale will be able to have meaningful lives in a ""work-free"" environment that basic income would provide them. Work will be fundamental to humans in the foreseeable future. 

Moreover, say basic income is politically off the table. It would be in employers' self interest to retain some workers, or provide them some means with which to earn a living. If there are fewer and fewer people to actually do work, there won't be any consumers for the producers employers produce with their robots. Therefore, employers likely will too push for wage subsidies, lowered work hours, subsidies employment, and expanded EITC, etc. They wouldn't be okay with the status quo b/c it harms their profits. And moreover, automation will vastly increase supply, helping create an abundance of goods and services, moving our society closer toward post-scarcity. As a result, prices for good and services will be pretty low, so workers won't need as high wages to consume them. 

## Section IV: Why Conditional Cash Transfers Beat Unconditional Basic Income

I also argue that it actually makes sense to have targeted welfare programs: food stamps, conditional cash-transfers, child nutrition programs, public housing, maternity and paternity care, sick leave policies, collective bargaining, free college, single-payer healthcare, etc. And I would like to see such a welfare scheme funded through a progressive income tax system (under which capital gains is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income), in addition to corporate taxes, and property taxes. I oppose the progressive consumption tax, a flat tax, and a land value tax.  

Food stamps, SNAP benefits, other forms of welfare and social security are all a necessity because you cannot have a system that relies on the rational actions of its participants. People will act irrationally: they will not spend their basic income in a way that guarantees their well-being, and society will incur enormous costs as a result in homelessness, food insecurity, crime, and drug abuse. Behavioral economics has shown that humans aren't rational actors: rather they have ""bounded rationality: ""bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the time available to make the decision."" In cases where humans naturally make optimal economic decisions, I am in favor of free-markets and against government intervention. In cases where individual economic decisions result in poor outcomes, I am in favor of government intervention to improve outcomes. 

Information failure is a microeconomic market failure in which consumers underconsume or overconsume a good due to imperfect information. Take healthcare for example. For example, take vaccinations. In neoclassical microeconomics, they are viewed as ""merit"" goods that are under-consumed due to information failure. The net private benefit is not fully recognized at the time of consumption. People may not anticipate that they my get sick in the future, and they won't recognize the benefits to their future selves for getting inoculated now. Moreover, inoculation (via vaccines or another method) is a positive externality that has external benefits to society: if you protect yourself, others around you are less likely to become sick. However, when people purchase goods, they don't take into account external benefits or costs, leading to underconsumption. In the market for vaccinations, it makes sense to increase consumer demand for vaccines through mandating people to take vaccines. Such targeted governmental intervention in the market actually improves outcomes, and moves the equilibrium quantity more toward the socially optimal level of consumption.

Moreover, a strong justification for the existence of our Social Security social insurance program is that while some people are rational actors, many others are not. Many don't exercise a lot of foresight: without forcing them to pay payroll taxes to fund Social Security, many people would not have income for themselves after they retire. People may not plan for the future and invest in private sector retirement or pension plan, like a 401k. Social Security a successful anti-poverty and social insurance program that ensures that people have some money after they retire. In this case, social engineering (forcing people to join a government retirement plan) actually improves outcomes in the economy and society through lower poverty and inequality, and greater financial security for elders. 

That's why I support conditional cash transfer programs instead of unconditional basic income. Forcing people to enroll their children in schools, visiting the doctor, and getting vaccinations are successful in overcoming the poverty trap and facilitating upward mobility, more so than UBI. It forces people who would otherwise make bad decisions for themselves and society to make more optimal decisions. 

Proponents of basic income argue that it's better to give people the freedom to use their handouts in whatever way the want, but we can have awareness campaigns educating people on how to improve their spending habits. To BI proponents, sure, recipients may portion their money out in ways that may not be the most reasonable, but given regularly cash they will still make rent and buy food. 

The above is definitely true for a rational actor. But for a drug addict? The mentally ill? Will they spend their basic income on housing and food? Or will their BI disappear and meanwhile the safety net drops out from under them? I would rather have a conditional cash transfer system for such individuals, otherwise society as a whole will incur costs from their poor decisions.  Replacing in kind programs entirely with a BIwould result in some consequences that BI supporters are not considering.  I'm afraid that if the BI did replace public services, businesses would be there to snap up a lot of that money in housing or medical care or whatever else the moment that payday came around. They will be more exploitative for drug addicts than the government. I'm afraid that there ARE people (not poor people or rich people in particular at all) who will act irrationally based on mental illness or drug addiction or something else, who will require the forms of assistance that would be replaced by a BI scheme.

## Section V: Does the Welfare Trap Truly Exist?

Moreover, libertarian supporters of UBI/NIT bring up the ""welfare-trap"" that exists in means tested welfare programs. I did a pretty lengthy search and could find no actual numerical data to confirm that this effect is significant. There are too many conflicting motivations at play, too many demographics, too many differing situations to say for certain our current welfare system turns people into lazy bums who won't seek work. Most welfare recipients today, given the opportunity, would prefer a steady cash income and the opportunity to advance to a stagnant and unproductive life on welfare. They want to look for work. 

## Section VI: Traditional Welfare and Entrepreneurship 

The traditional welfare state has shown to be successful in the social democratic nations of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and to a lesser extent, Canada. They reduce excessive inequality and poverty, while also facilitating upward mobility. People aren't trapped in poverty. Moreover, the traditional welfare state is more efficient than many people claim. The Roosevelt Institute's Mike Konczal argues that in the existing welfare state, ""there are relatively few programs and they are run at a decent administrative cost."" Proponents of BI argue that UBI would facilitate entrepreneurship, [but it's not as if the current welfare schemes that currently exist in the western world discourage start-ups.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/welfare-makes-america-more-entrepreneurial/388598/)

## Section VII: Keynesian Automatic Stabilizers 

From a macroeconomic perspective, many New Keynesian economists believe that transfer payments (unemployment insurance, food stamp payments, Social Security, conditional cash-transfers, etc) help macroeconomic stability by acting as automatic stabilizers. Supporters of UBI often criticize the current welfare scheme on the grounds that costs fluctuate with the performance of the economy. However, fluctuating costs makes sense if you use a Keynesian framework. Higher welfare payouts during recessions help stabilize consumption (and investment via the accelerator effect) during demand-deficient recessions by increasing people's disposable income; during demand-pull inflation, cutbacks in welfare spending decrease people's disposable incomes, which helps close the inflationary gap (when too much money is chasing too few goods). I'm not convinced that UBI would be better to our current welfare scheme with regards to acting as an automatic stabilizer.

## Section VIII: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets

Furthermore, deregulating the marketplace through passing ""right-to-work"" laws and removing minimum wage legislation after BI is passed may worsen outcomes. Even if workers are given an income floor, corporations can still artificially reduce pay in oligopsonistic and monopsonistic markets. Within these imperfect labor market structures, minimum wage laws and collective bargaining laws actually help increase efficiency and equity. 

## Section IX: The Superiority of Progressive Income Taxes

Regarding the funding side, I oppose forgoing our progressive income tax system in favor of a flat tax. Given that income inequality is rising in developed nations due to globalization, automation, and a host of other factors, moving to a flat tax would exacerbate this inequality. A flat tax would shift tax burden away from the rich, to the middle and lower class. It would result in the elimination of deductions may have a positive impact on taxpayers with lower income (such as the EITC). The government wouldn't be able to use tax code to encourage desirable activities, such as giving tax credits for making a home more energy-efficient (energy efficiency is a positive externality with which governments can promote sustainable growth that doesn't lead to environmental degradation). Moreover, government revenues would drastically decrease, making it difficult to fund universal healthcare, free K-12, and a host of other measures.

Proponents say flat taxes don't discriminate based on income level; everyone pays the same percent of income. This argument, however, assumes the marginal benefit of earning a dollar is always the same. To me, it's common sense that the marginal utility of the dollar decreases as income increases. The flat tax isn't regressive in the strictest sense (it's not as if the tax RATE is being increased as you go down the income-ladder). but it can be considered regressive in that the burden is disproportionately felt by lower income families. Necessities, such as expenses for food, clothing, and shelter tend to make make up a higher percentage of a lower income consumer's overall budget. True, this can be mitigated by allowing a rebate on purchases of necessities; since the value of money is still inversely related to income however, the system would continue to be unequal. A rebate would just be a band-aid fix. 

Also in practice, many of the ""flat tax"" proposals by conservative politicians don't treat income equally. Yes, they may have a flat rate on income taxes. But they would lower or possibly eliminate taxes on investments, such as capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc, that disproportionately benefit the rich. These proposals keep in place loopholes that benefit such top earners.

Given that the ""progressive consumption tax scheme,"" another tax scheme favored by BI proponents, would also invariably lower or eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, carried interest, etc., I'm opposed to that too. Some economists oppose capital gains taxes, asserting that they are a tax on savings. We're engaging in ""double taxation."" People already pay tax on their income, and then they invest some of their savings into stocks, bonds, etc. Then when they sell their assets for a profit, they pay an additional tax on that. Dividends taxes are also double taxation (corporations pay a corporate tax first and then investors pay a dividends tax on dividend payouts). From a theoretical perspective, it all makes sense to eliminate capital gains and dividends taxes, because theoretically, they discourage savings. 

However, this theory does not reflect reality, and higher capital gains tax rates haven't really affected the economy. Even Ronald Reagan raised the capital gains tax rate, and believed income from labor and investment should be taxed at an equal rate. In the real world, through a higher capital gains rate, you can make a significant dent in income inequality w/o many adverse economic effects. Basically, the economic distortions from ""double taxation"" that economists warn us about don't have that great of an effect on the real world. There is no significant statistical economic relationship between capital gains rates and economic growth (refuting aspects of supply side economics). 

Also the lower capital gains rate could ironically create economic distortions itself: [""The enormous tax savings available likely lure too many highly productive people into the private equity business, drawing them away from other potentially more socially valuable enterprises.""] (http://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8226915/rubio-lee-tax-plan)

A ""progressive consumption tax,"" while superior to a flat tax (and less regressive), is inferior to a progressive income tax. The PCT would almost assuredly increase wealthy inequality: since wealthy would be consuming less and investing more, they'd  grow their net wealth even faster than the current pace. This is an unintended effect of the PCT, which would tax consumption and would incentivize savings. Given that automation will increase wealth inequality, it doesn't seem like a good idea to me to exacerbate the trend by gutting capital gains taxes and adopting the PCT. Proponents of the PCT argue that progressive income taxes discourage work due to high marginal rates, but the actual extent to which these market distortions occur in the real world are exaggerated a lot. Even if we had strong inheritance taxes to counteract wealth inequality, a PCT is inferior to a PIT, because with the latter, the government can still use the  tax code to encourage desirable activities. Progressive income taxes also protect taxpayer during hard times - when income goes down, the tax rate also goes down
As I said, I don't believe that human beings are always rational, so social engineering in certain instances can improve outcomes. 

Finally, I oppose the land value tax, another tax scheme favored by many BI opponents, and I instead support the traditional property tax. A land value tax would exacerbate economic inequality. If property taxes were were only based on the value of the land, rich people would buy small lots in cheap areas, build massive mansions worth millions, and pay almost no taxes.Then the working class people who buy small homes on small lots in the city (where dirt is worth more) would be paying more in taxes.

I support a progressive tax system because I'm of the belief that you should pay what you can. If you can afford an expensive house, you can afford to pay taxes on the value of the house, including the improvements built on that house. 

## Section X: Conclusion

I believe an unconditional basic income scheme, including in all of its flavors (negative income tax, citizen's dividend, demogrant, social wage, etc.) is ultimately a pretty flawed scheme. I view the traditional western social safety net as superior. For the reasons above, I feel that it's better for society to expand the traditional social safety net rather than dismantle it completely and replace with a UBI or NIT scheme. I support basic income in addition to the existing scheme (like how the EITC works alongside other tax credits and welfare programs), but I oppose scraping the traditional welfare state."
3057_A,t1_cpuh9jr_1,huadpe,"So there's a lot of good research on the ""welfare trap"" though not using that term.  The term that's usually used is what's called the ""implicit marginal tax rate.""  Essentially, that's the rate at which taxes + reduced benefits cut away at new earned income.
One of the reasons for consolidating a lot of conditional programs into one unconditional or less conditional program is so that we can make sure that the sum of those fall-offs doesn't add up to a situation where people are better off not getting slightly higher paying jobs."
3057_A,t1_cpuh9jr_2,huadpe,"So for instance, if you look at some of the bigger safety net programs in the US: Rental assistance falls off at a pretty consistent 1/3 of your income.  The EITC falls off at about 40% during the fall off period.  Food stamps also fall off, but I don't remember the precise rate (and IIRC it can vary by state a bit.)"

In particular, check out the summary fig 1 on page 6 of the PDF.  The disposable income line is just incredibly flat for a single parent with one child from $0 income to $30,000 income.  There's like zero incentive to go from making $10,000/yr to $20,000/yr.  That's a big part of what a guaranteed basic income can solve."

They told me that I couldn't leave table till I ate it. Sometimes I was there even few hours. In the end, they couldn't force me to start eating these things.

dlu7qbe,dlu7qbe_1,Cortoro,"I'm not a hugger, so my eye is already twitching.  /u/domino_stars raises an excellent point about people who have already experienced trauma from non-consensual touch can and do freeze and are unable to express their verbal non-consent.  So I'll address the ""it's not a huge deal"".
First, ever culture has their own unspoken rules regarding physical contact.  I was raised in a touch-conservative family and in a touch-conservative culture (certain region of America where hugging people who aren't close to you isn't done).  I expect a certain amount of personal space in a public area and especially between strangers.  I do not want, nor do I expect, a stranger to be comfortable hugging me.  I am a petite build.  If a larger man or woman comes in and violates my personal space - and it is a violation - that is a rattling experience because I am not used to it, it is not culturally appropriate, and my body is not yours to treat however you want."
dlu7qbe,dlu7qbe_2,Cortoro,"By touching my body without my explicit consent, you have violated my trust in you (which as someone new was minimal to begin with), you have revealed that you do not care enough about my self agency to not be touched which is threatening and you have let me know that you do not care that this makes me uncomfortable which telegraphs a certain sense of self-superiority on your part.  Your desire to violate my body is more important than my right to not be touched against my will."
dlu7qbe,dlu7qbe_3,Cortoro,"Will I wind up weeping in the corner?  No.  But my level of anxiety will be increased for quite some time and it's definitely going to color not only any future interactions with you, but with whoever was stupid enough to introduce me to the kind of person that you are."
dlu7qbe,dlu7qbe_4,Cortoro,"Body language is interpreted by different people in different ways and is definitely not consent for another person to touch you.  A person who wants to hug another is more likely to misinterpret signals or, again disrespect the individual who does not want to be hugged.
Your desire to hug does is not important enough to violate another person's body.  If you want a hug, you can use body language to communicate that you want to engage in a hug without touching the person, thus respecting the person and their body enough to let them choose if they want to engage in the hug.  Or you can just ask them.  The onus shouldn't be on the person you wish to hug."

The gender is irrelevant (even beyond me, you don't know always know the sexual orientation of the person you are hugging)."
dlu7qbe,dluaddo_2,Cortoro,"How do you realistically telegraph that you want to hug someone?  I think it's unreasonable that you're asking me that, but you expect someone to use body language to communicate that they do NOT want a hug.  If you don't know a person well enough to use your body language to clearly communicate your desire to hug them, then as I originally posted, you should ASK.  Use your words.  ""Are you comfortable with me giving you a hug?"" or some variation of that statement."

But if we're going to project how others should feel:  If a person is trying to give me a hug as a greeting, then having their hug politely declined and a warm greeting should suffice.  If a person is trying to give me a hug in a romantic sense, then they should understand that by showing me their respect for my body they are fostering trust and intimacy much more than a hug would."
dlu7qbe,dluauv9_2,Cortoro,"And with this mentality, where does the litmus test end?  Should I allow people to kiss me?  To maintain prolonged physical contact?  Should I be having sex with people I have no interest in because if I turn them down I might hurt their feelings?  There is a firm line in the sand:  This is my body. This is not your body.  I have the right to determine how I want to have my body treated by others."

The point is that a hug is physical contact and if you are doing it without consent then you are forcing unwanted physical contact on another person's body.  It is immoral (and a crime, at least in my country) to impose your physical will on another person's body without their consent."
dlu7qbe,dluba32_2,Cortoro,"You have no way of knowing how a person will feel or react if you hug them without their consent.

However, if you appreciate that the Internet provides opportunities for small companies to compete with the big companies on a level playing field, then this will inevitably be bad in the long run.

I was thinking the same. If you had a test case of this (that is, a case in which someone actually got sick due to a specific unvaccinated person), you could conceivably make out the elements of a negligence claim:"
dy2iwd1,dy2z5gl_2,JackWorthing,"1) Duty: People generally have a legal duty to exercise ""reasonable care"" to avoid injury to others. This element hinges on whether the harm caused is ""foreseeable,"" but in most circumstances, you have a duty of reasonable care to those in physical proximity to you.
Is failing to vaccinate a failure to exercise such care? I don't believe there's any precedent for that, but it's possible a court would buy that. In any case, this would be the first major legal hurdle."
dy2iwd1,dy2z5gl_3,JackWorthing,"2) Breach: If there is indeed a duty, then the defendant breached that duty by not vaccinating. Easy enough.
3) Damages: Plaintiff got sick. Easy enough, this is why you are suing in the first place.
4) Causation: There are two elements to this. Was defendant's action a substantial factor in bringing about the harm (sickness)?  And was that harm (sickness) a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's failure to vaccinate?"
dy2iwd1,dy2z5gl_4,JackWorthing,"The first question is a tough one. How can you prove you got sick from a specific person? Barring some sort of notable physical contact or assault, it would seem a pretty tenuous case. Heck, every time I get sick I play the game ""OK, who got me sick?"" but it's pretty much a guess."
dy2iwd1,dy2z5gl_5,JackWorthing,"Maybe someday we'll have the technology to trace the spread of disease or match up viruses or something, but for right now I think OP's suggestion is impossible to implement because it would be impossible to prove -- regardless of the ethics of it.
EDIT: OP has cited cases where the CDC found ""patient 0"" for certain outbreaks. Assuming that's true, I think that, unless you could prove ""patient 0"" was actually the one that got you sick, a defendant would have a pretty good argument that there were superseding actions by the intermediary carriers."

It means that we need high quality proteins to sustain our body expenditures. The moment where animals started to eat meat, is the moment where large and quality brains and skeletal structure started to form. Suddenly the mammals didn't have to spend all the  time eating to sustain such a massive body and brain and be literally prey for others."
d0bz6bp,d0bz6bp_2,Gladix,"Talking about prey. The hunting of animals is another benchmark for humans (well ancient animal like ancestors of humans). Once we started eating meat, we had to start hunt for food. That means we had to adapt to run fast, be strong and most importantly be clever.
Some herbivores are by leagues faster than carnivores. Which offcourse means we needed to use our brains to kill them. Starting to form packs, cornering the animals, using tools to hunt for the animals, etc... None of our society would be possible if we didn't hunt animals."
d0bz6bp,d0bz6bp_3,Gladix,"&gt;It's a way to control the population of animals"" - I'm not incredibly well researched on this, but I'm almost certain that the population of animals we eat is down to the fact that there's a high demand for their meat, not the other way around. And even if that was wrong, literally eating them seems a bit of a strange solution.
As twisted as it sounds. Us eating animals is ensuring strong and steady population of those animals. Think about animals that are going to go extinct and then tell me how many of those animals are we actively eating? The only thing I can think of are whales specific to Pacific"
d0bz6bp,d0bz6bp_4,Gladix,"&gt;""It's what we've always done"" - Literally not an argument. Until 100 years ago we hadn't figured out basic hygiene standards in hospitals.
Let's formulate it bit better. Our genes developed before the agricultural revolution. Our bodies are literally programed to function effectively on the diet consisting of meat. Problems such as diabetes, heart problems, obesity wasn't an issue until we started to grow crops, process sugar and salt. Our body simply doesn't work in an optimal way to adjust for those factors as of yet."
d0bz6bp,d0bz6bp_5,Gladix,"Furthermore people who don't eat meat are at higher risk of having various mental issues, by having a chemical imbalance in brain. (Body does not know how to properly adjust if meat is not included in your diet)
Not to mention various other problems. Such as narcolepsi, insomnia, weakened and imparired senses, and other problems that arise if you don't have enough sustained long-lasting energy that our body build specifically from meat. Etc, etc... So better way to phrase this criticism would be."
d0bz6bp,d0bz6bp_6,Gladix,"Because our body doesn't know how to function properly without meat.
Okay, so why should we eat meat now. In todays world, where we don't really NEED meat to survive. You can get all the esentials without meat. But you need to do a proper research. You need to carefully eat things that give you the most ammount of quality protein, and you should also have special food supplements to avoid the vast majority, if not all the problems you get from not eating meat."
d0bz6bp,d0bz6bp_7,Gladix,"But, and this is a big but. Eating meat is still the most optimal way to get yourself into the best health you can possibly have. Which is the single most important thing you have."

First of all, obvious point - 50% of marriages end in divorce, so you know there's a good chance it won't work out. But even if you do make it work - at what cost, to your and your partner's happiness? I think that if you really do love each other, you will stick together for as long as that holds true, marriage or not. Marriage is a way of saying ""even if we start to absolutely hate each others guts, we're bound to each other like it or not."" Why would you subject yourself to that potential torment? If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be - let each other go. And are you so afraid that your partner will stop loving you and leave you for someone else, that you have to handcuff them to you with marriage? If your love for your partner is anything more than purely selfish, you should want your partner to be happy. So you should let them go if their happiness requires it. If the relationship goes sour, you should just be able to say ""okay we're done. Peace out."" But if you're married, then you have to go through the whole messy divorce problem, after ""trying to make it work"" with marriage counseling for who knows how many years. Essentially, by getting married you earn yourself no advantages in your relationship, but you put yourself at risk for some serious unhappiness. I understand there may be certain legal benefits, but lets leave that aside, since no one cites tax write-offs as their primary reason for getting married. 

More generally, I believe that this romantic ideal of two people faithfully monogamous to each other for the rest of their lives is just pure Disney, and it's causing more harm than good. So a lot of my criticism of marriage applies to monogamous relationships in general. We will continue to suffer from relationships - either staying in unhappy ones, or being devastated when a partner leaves or cheats on us - until we accept that both partners are free and independent human beings, and a good relationship is one that is enthusiastically engaged in on both sides. If for whatever reason one partner is unhappy with the relationship, then they should be free to leave it without any shame or guilt. They shouldn't feel like they have to hide their feelings, or go behind their partner's back and cheat on them. I think it's perfectly natural for a relationship to have its time, and run its course. By letting go of a bad relationship, you open yourself up to a better one. "

2028_B,t3_1ppyu1,sooneday,"In season one of Game of Thrones there are five main factions: The Starks, The Lannisters, Robert Baratheon, The Wall, and The Targaryens. The plots with The Wall and The Targaryens are essentially scaffolding for events in future seasons. This leaves the Lannisters, King Baratheon, and the Starks as possible protagonists. 

 

Out of these three, only the Lannisters control the plot. The Starks and Robert respond to and try to counter the Lannisters' plots. Since only the Lannisters are guiding the plot they are the protagonists, while the Starks are the antagonists since they oppose the Lannisters' decisions. 


If I was reducing the protagonists and antagonists to specific people I would say that Cersei Lannister is the protagonist, while Ned Stark is the antagonist. 

Cersie is responsible for Bran's twice attempted murder, the murder of King Robert, Joffrery's takeover, the killing of the dire wolf, and is insinuated as being behind numerous other events. Ned Stark is in direct opposition to all of these events. "

Literally everything that occurs in the novels and the TV show is based around the acquisition of the Iron Throne and characters who set things in motion - real movers like Petyr Baelish and Varys - do so for either blatant self interest (Littlefinger) or out of some sense of duty to the realm (Varys). "
2028_B,t1_cd5a2h3,sooneday,"I like this answer, but I don't quite agree with it. The Iron Throne simply exists. It has no motives and can't direct the plot. Without the characters there would be no story. Without The Iron Throne there could be other plots or conflicts. "

So the Iron Throne hasn't got any motivations, but the desire to acquire it drives all the events of the books, so it can in one sense be said to be a character due purely to the esteem with which the other characters hold it in."

I've thought about this more and you make a good point. While under a common definition The Iron Throne is not technically a protagonist because it isn't a character it does serve the same role as one in moving the plot and focusing the piece. Expanding the definition of protagonist to include concepts provides utility for authors when they are designing stories so I accept your expanded definition."

public nudity or fornication (providing there are no witnesses that have not consented)

* the consumption of pornography (not involving coercion)

* depiction of cartoon child porn (not involving harm to actual children)

* sexting between minors (voluntary action)

* the absence of a seatbelt in a car 

I'm not saying the Government should condone the use of drugs, prostitution, or not wearing a seatbelt. What I *am* saying is I don't believe the government should have any say in what people do to themselves assuming it doesn't harm anyone, it isn't their job to make things they don't like illegal. If Someone wants to do meth, I don't think its the governments job to detain them. If someone decides they are willing to be a prostitute to make money, or a minor wants to sext their partner I really don't think the government has any reason to step in and punish them. The war on drugs (in the US at least) has been a huge failure, not only has it failed to dramatically lower instance of drug abuse but it has also put hundreds of thousands of Americans in the prison system. Minors have unregulated access to pretty much any illegal drug, more so than alcohol and tabacco which are regulated. 

I believe the government should regulate drugs, and prostitution. But aside from that people should have unregulated freedoms assuming they aren't hurting anyone.

2983_B,t3_32cnkw,JonnyGalt,"I have been hearing a lot on the news about how $29 dollars a week for food is very difficult to live on and you can not feed yourself nutritiously for that amount. I strongly disagree with this position as I have lived for $25 when I was saving for graduate school. I actually ate healthier and lost over 20lbs fat during the process (I worked out a lot during this time also). 

I came from an immigrant background and it is not uncommon to know families that support themselves on a budget of 100-150 dollar budget for food every month. The trick is learning how to shop and how to cook. With a budget of $29/week or about $116 a month, I have seen families of 3 feed themselves (though they did work hard to make that money stretch). I believe that $29 dollars a week is plenty of money to live off of for food and the complaint is baseless. 

Here are some sample prices of groceries I purchased regularly. Taking advantage of seasonal flux in food prices can help you reduce your food costs even further. 

Starch:

20lb bag of rice - $15-20 dollars (depending on the quality) This has a higher initial cost but it ends up evening out throughout time. If you can not bare the up front cost initially, smaller bags of rice could easily be found for about 1 dollar per pound at walmart. a 20lb bag of rice lasts me about 1.5-2 months.

Pasta -~$1/lb Walmart usually has pasta at about a dollar a pound (if not more). 

Potato - ~ $.2-$.5 a pound. You can easily find a 10lb bag of potato between $2-$2.5. When they are in season, I have seen them for as low as $.5 for a 10 pound bag. 

Ramen - about 10-25 cents per bag. I tried to stay away from ramen as much as I can since they are pretty unhealthy but if you are tired and just want a quick meal, ramen gets the job done. 

Bread - $1 per loaf at walmart/aldi 

cereal - $4 for a giant bag of generic brand cereal at walmart. Those usually lasts me at least 2-3 weeks. 

Protein

whole chicken: between $1-$1.5/lb. Walmart and Aldi usually have them in a pack of 2 for 6-8 dollars. I usually buy two per week. 

Pork Shoulders: usually between $1-$2/lb. Other parts of the pig often go on sale for below $2/lb so shop as you see fit. 

Kielbasa/smoked sausage - Usually $2/lb

ground pork/turkey - ~$2.5/lb

Whole Turkey - $1-$2/lb when not in season. I usually buy 1-2 turkey right after thanksgiving when they go on sale for around $.5/lb and freeze them. Then I roast the turkey, break it down and use the meat for sandwich meat. I make stock/soups from the bones/skin/fat/left over bits. 

Beans - ~ $1-1.5/lb, a good source of protein fiber and starch. It is also absolutely delicious if you cook them right.

Eggs - ~$.15/egg. I usually buy them in huge packs of 48. They end up costing around 6-7 dollars per pack and the pack usually lasts me the month. 

Tofu - $.5-$1/lb I usually purchase tofu in Asian markets and they are usually about 1 dollar pack. I can't remember the exact size of the package but they are at least 1lb. 

Peanut Butter - $2-$3 for a huge jar. Even cheaper if you buy the industrial size ones. 


Veggies

Here is the part that gets slightly trickier. I really like veggies and I also use a lot of Asian veggies that are not as accessible for much of the population. I also take advantage of my local farmer's market and really pay attention to what veggies are in season. the price flux on veggies are hard to predict for country so these are just general estimates for the prices. For the sake of argument, I will stick to veggies that are common throughout the US. 


Onions -  $.5-.75/lb you can find onions easily enough at any super market for about 2-3 dollars for a bag. Depending on the season and your location, I seen them for as little as $1/5lb bag. When onions are on sale like that I usually buy a lot and freeze them. 

Cucumber - $.25-$.5/cucumber 

Zucchini/squash - $.25-$.5 per unit. I usually only buy these when they are in season. You can usually get a nice variety during the summer, often for even cheaper. 

Tomatoes - ~ $1-$1.5/lb. You can find them for incredibly cheap during the summers. I have walked away from a box (estimating between 12-15lbs) for $7.5. Usually if I find them cheap, I make tomato sauce with them. [A really simple but amazing recipe is just butter, onion, and tomatoes](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce). The recipe is by Marcella Hazan (picture Julia Child of Italian cooking) and it tastes absolutely amazing. When I first the recipe, I was very very hesitant and did not think it would taste good at all but it ended up being one of the best tomato sauces I have ever tried. You can freeze/can the sauce to save for later. 

Peppers - I usually go to mexican/asian markets for peppers. They usually sell by the pound and you can usually get 3-4 green or red peppers for about a dollar. I also use tons of jalapenos and 1 dollar will get you a huge bag in those markets. 

Carrots - easily found all year round for &lt;$1 a pound. 

Eggplant - once again, I usually only buy these in season but they usually go for about $2-3 per box (I am guessing around $1/lb). 

Lettuce - $1/head I usually don't eat that much lettuce but they can be found cheaply.

Corn - $.1/-$.25/ear Once again, keep it seasonable. 

Herbs - I usually pick up cilantro, scallion, ginger, and garlic at the mexican/asian markets. They tend to be significantly cheaper. Once again, I understand not everyone have access to these. Cilantro - $.5/bunch; Scallion usually $1 for 2-4 bunches; ginger - I honestly can't remember but i usually never pay over a dollar for it and it lasts me several weeks; garlic - a bundle of 5 goes for about $1. 

Fruits

I unfortunately am not a big fruit eater so I don't have too much info on this...

I understand there are issues such as some mexican/asian stores doesn't accept food stamps, I shop at farmer's markets sometimes and they definitely do not accept food stamps, but vast majority of my shopping came from aldi/walmart so I think these prices are realistic. Additionally, I also understand food prices different from city to city, I have only really lived in medium size cities (largest being Boston) so I don't know if my experiences can be applied to NYC, LA, SF, and places like that. Lastly, if you are using cash, you can negotiate prices with vendors at farmer's markets. Especially if you wait until the market is about to be closed, a lot of vendors are willing to sell you what they have left at a ridiculously low price (I have literally walked away with boxes and crates full of food for less than 10 dollars). 


Sample Week of Groceries:

(I am reducing the price of some of these from my prices since I wouldn't use the whole container/amount).

2 Chickens - $8

1lb of Rice ~ $.7

1lb of pasta - $1

2lb of potato - $1

Herbs ~ $1

2lb of beans - $2

2lbs of Tofu - $2

Eggs - $1.5

Celery - $1

Peppers - $1

Tomatoes - $2

Cucumbers - $2

Onions - $1

cereal - $1

Milk - $1.5

bread - $1

Peanut Butter - $1

Total: $28.7

With $29 dollars you get ~ 7 pounds of protein from the chicken and tofu. You also get additional protein from PB, eggs, and beans. You'll have ~ 2lbs of cooked rice, a whole loaf of bread, 2lb of potatoes,  &gt;1lb of cooked pasta, and breakfast cereal for your starch. You will also have 4-8 cucumbers, 2-4 bell peppers, ~ 1.5lb of tomatoes, and ~ 2lb of onions for your veggies. 

For breakfast: 

Toast with peanut butter and egg. Cereal if you want a change of pace. 

Lunch/dinner 

Debone the chicken and you are left with 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 wings, 4 drumsticks, and 4 tenders. Rest of the meat and the bones goes into a stock pot with 1/2 the celery, and onions (and possibly some carrots) for chicken soup. With the rest of the meat, you can make chicken salad, pulled chicken, grilled chicken, etc (use your imagination). There are tons of things you can do with tofu and you can make some delicious pasta dishes with the garlic, and tomatoes. Rice and Bean is always a solid option and you can opt out of a chicken for some sausage or pork. 

Concerns and arguments against: 

I understand some states still taxes food (I am not sure if you ever get taxed for food stamps). I know I cut it pretty close to the $29 mark but I honestly think this is way more food than a reasonable person should eat in a week (more than 2lb of food/day from the starches, chicken, and tofu alone). 

I also am operating on a stocked pantry. I know my calculations does not account for this but pantries are stocked over time and it is way to hard to figure out how much veggie oil you'll use/cost for the week. Stocking a pantry also is not very expensive, flour, salt, sugar, pepper, cornmeal, soy sauce, oil, baking soda, etc should not cost more than $20 all together. You can get pretty far with just salt, sugar, pepper, oil, and the herbs I included. You can also slowly stock up your spice collection. Basics such as garlic powder/chili/cayenne/oregano, are all around 2-3 dollars tops and they last a very long time. 

Some people lack the time to properly cook their meals:

I worked two jobs (full time and a part time) while saving for my graduate school. I will usually have at least 1 night/weekend day free. I usually prepare my food for the week that night so I don't have to spend time cooking everyday. 

Food deserts:

This is a pretty legitimate concern. I honestly had no experience with this issue but I have heard plenty about it. For the most part, I had a car so shopping was relatively a simple task. I understand that without transportation, while living in a food desert, getting cheap fresh groceries is an issue. However, I think this is more of a city or community issue that needs to be address rather than the food stamp amount. I also have taken public transportation to grocery shop (it sucks but you do what you have to do). I have also known plenty of immigrants who carpool to grocery shop. None of these solutions are elegant but I have seem plenty of people make it work.

2983_B,t1_cqa9pas_1,THESLIMREAPERRR,"1) Not everyone on welfare really has the time to cook every dish. Take a single dad who works 7-7. He wakes up at 5:30, getsvthe kids ready for sxhool grabs a couple frozen dinners and apples, and goes straight to work without eating breakfast. Eats those on his 2 30-minute breaks, gets off at 7. Now hes hungry, and goes to pick up his kids from daycare. He gets home, and now it's 8:00. He hasn't eaten yet, not have his kids, so he pops some frozen chicken tenders in the microwave, puts some Mac and cheese and green beans on the stove and waits. Now it's 8:45 and he needs to help the kids with homework and put them in bed, to get in bed at 10 and wake up at 5:30 the next day. He does this 5 days a week, and takes the kids out on the weekends. Where is the time for meal prep, to cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday? Pre-made meals are more extensive, sure, but are almost necessary. Cooking from scratch can take time, time that this dude doesn't have. You say 29 a week is enough? This dude probably just ate half that in a day by himself on some hot pockets, chips, mac and cheese, green beans, apples, and chicken tenders and he didn't even eat breakfast or get any leisure time."
2983_B,t1_cqa9pas_2,THESLIMREAPERRR,"His other options are to sacrifice sleep for meal prep, or meal prep on the weekends, sacrificing some of what little leisure time he has. He doesnt have anything other than a macrowave at work nor time to even put some sandwhiches together there before he eats them.
He could just bring some fruits, nuts, cheese, and raw veggies to work and feed that to his kids, sure. But maybe he wants some variety once in a while too? Why make his life harder and put him on the bare minimum, you know. Just give the dude a break. It's not like he's buying toys, just food to get buy. Let him have some options, you know."
2983_B,t1_cqa9pas_3,THESLIMREAPERRR,"I know it is possible to do things the way you stated, but I used to get $200 a month for me and spent it all on fruits, veggies, bread, yogurt, raw meats, spices, juices, and some frozen dinners for work and still spent out of my own pocket to eat fast food sometimes."
2983_B,t1_cqaauz2,JonnyGalt,"Wouldn't he get additional food stamps for his child? I am basing this off of a single person.  14/day for a person is also pretty high, you can learn to cook simple recipes that doesn't take that much time. Simplest you can do, salt an pepper the chicken and place in the oven to roast ~ 5 minutes prep, 30-60 minute to cook but he can spend that time doing other things. Take the roasted chicken and shred it (maybe 5 minutes), add some bbq or salsa and you have food for the next 4 meals at least. throw the extra bits and bones into a pot, add water, chop onion and celery and added to the pot (10 min if that). Add noodles to it later, maybe 1 min. While the food is cooking, you can do plenty of other things, its not like you have to stand next to the pot the whole time. I am no stranger to working long hours, I just usually took 3-4 hours a week preparing my meals for the week. I'd say about 50% of that time is waiting for the food to cook and I am free to do other things. "
2983_B,t1_cqabth0_1,THESLIMREAPERRR,"Oh he definitely would, at a rate proportional to cover the kids, though I don't think it would really make an impact on how much he gets to spend on food for himself. I guess I'm just trying to come up with a hypothetical situation to show why some people would need more. Maybe replace the kids with classes at a university, which will take a good chunk of time without altering the rate of SNAP benefits."
2983_B,t1_cqabth0_2,THESLIMREAPERRR,"My argument comes down to the time meal prep takes. Even though it seems small, it isn't negligible. Many people in poverty simply don't have the time to cook every day, and pre-packaged meals are gonna cost more. For someone going to a job 12 hours a day and school for another 3, there simply may not be time in the day/week for meal prep, other than maybe some sandwiches. This limits options."
2983_B,t1_cqabth0_3,THESLIMREAPERRR,"The amount of benefits should be enough to cover at least most of the population it is intended for. Plus, the money that isn't spent, does not accumulate. For example, if I get 200 in January and spend 150 on food, then I get 150 put back on my card in February to bring me back up to 200. While I could use the extra to buy a bunch of junk I don't need, that will just take up space and cause clutter and spoilage, so I wouldn't spend it just to spend it. I'd just buy what looks good and suits my personal needs, you know?"
2983_B,t1_cqabth0_4,THESLIMREAPERRR,"Plus, in my subjective opinion, we should give a little bit of wiggle room just because it's the humane way to go about it. If we have to slash spending, it should come from the top (like corporate subsidies) rather than the bottom (like peoples' food and medicine)."
2983_B,t1_cqacc9t_1,JonnyGalt,"I definitely agree that meal prep will take time, no matter how negligible. However, we all have to spent time preparing meals unless you have the luxury of eating out every meal. I do understand that time might be more valuable for those in the circumstances you described so I will make a concession there. I also understand that you don't get to keep the money you don't spend and that makes things more difficult (though you could invest in dry goods, sauces/non perishables, or things for your pantry).  ∆"
2983_B,t1_cqacc9t_2,JonnyGalt,"I think there could be a little more wiggle room, I guess my original point is an reaction to those who say $29 dollars is impossible."

d0yg3xm,d0yg3xm_1,flinty_day_off,"I attended the Chicago protest. It was more than just a fun day of shouting.
For me it was more personal. It was one particular quote of his that stood out. ""I love Chicago""
That particular quote boiled my blood. Chicago is so much more than the Magnificent Mile that surrounds his building. Chicago is melting pot. Muslims, immigrants, african americans, Chinese, Korea etc. The south side, little village, china town, Greentown, Westside. We are a city, that is basically against everything he stands for. Chicago is so much more than the Loop. He can have his building, but don't bring his wall loving ass to a city that was built on immigrants."

dbnvhv7,dbnvhv7_1,WhenSnowDies,"I'd say you should change your view from believing the government should help the mentally ill, to the government should provide more social services to vulnerable individuals.
After all, you wouldn't say that the government should do more to support churches, so more people could see priests.
That matters because psych is something other than what you think it is: It's philosophy, not a formal science. For example, does there exist a theory of mental health, or is that just a given arrived at by the musings of honorary men (like sages..)? Was the idea of mental health arrived at by numerous independent strings of evidence leading to a hypothesis that was tested? What are the controls, and who is the control mentally healthy person? Is it testable? Repeatable? Falsifiable in any way?"
dbnvhv7,dbnvhv7_2,WhenSnowDies,"There is no theory of mental health. It's not a science. It's not useless, just like the priesthoods aren't socially useless, and mental health services do good for some folks. Just saying, do you want the government to back and validate a form or ethics or philosophy? Look what happened the first time."

dbnvhv7,dbnx55i_1,WhenSnowDies,"That's exactly the reasoning philosophers/religious people use. ""Tide goes in, tide goes out.""
Your article of evidence for something being unusual or interesting doesn't immediately mean that your presuppositions are correct. A person with a traditionalist belief structure could have just said, ""Possession isn't a philosophy. The fact that I suddenly do not need sleep for 5 days, and believe I am god is not a philosophy."""
dbnvhv7,dbnx55i_2,WhenSnowDies,"Again, what are the many independent strings of empirical evidence leading to the Theory of Mental Illness?
What is the Theory of Mental Illness?
How is it testable?
How is it repeatable?
What are the controls?
How is it falsifiable?
What predictions does it make?
Those are the scientific criterion. If it cannot meet those, what is it? Applied pop philosophy, supported in education and public perception, not unlike yesterday's Church."
dbnvhv7,dbnx55i_3,WhenSnowDies,Yeah surprise you're a part of history too.
dbnvhv7,dbnxbz5,pink_rabbit13,There is a lot of empirical research on mental health.
dbnvhv7,dbnyai1_1,WhenSnowDies,"Ok but it has to meet every single criterion of the scientific method to be a valid theory.
You could say that mental health is a hypothesis, but then you'd have a century of completely inconclusive research and massive funding on a single hypothesis, and research without controls or predictions or anything that'd make it remotely scientific."
dbnvhv7,dbnyai1_2,WhenSnowDies,"Even then, the trend of psych (due to these problems and more) is to move away from ""mental health"" and more towards the attitude of the ""disorder"". This is because psych has trends, because it's social and not about data analysis or mining (scientific). Therefore less popular philosophical trends (like diagnosing homosexuals as mentally ill) led to the idea of the ""disorder"": Anything whatsoever that you feel causes you to not function how you'd like, or to be dis-ordered in your life."

That's not science, that's a cultural attitude (will, consent, privacy) meeting utility (help with compulsion). The methods to ""cure"" and the attitude that something has invaded are also cultural."
dbnvhv7,dbnyai1_4,WhenSnowDies,"This is pure culture and philosophy, and it's only ""scientific"" in language and reputation because science is very popular because of it's feats.

We wish it was on the epistemological tier of the sciences."
dbnvhv7,dbnyai1_5,WhenSnowDies,"It's also very like us: It's confession-based, a learned man tells us that it's not us but some corrupting agent (illness/disorder/sin) and attempts to purify us. We keep coming back and depend on it (church). A communal society, on the other hand, might consider a mental illness a condition of the society: Either that the social group is corrupt and bullying good persons, or that the ill person is just being rejected because they're a bad egg and would be accepted if they would only save face."

dmnvx6r,dmnvx6r,shamls,I wonder if they even think about it when they put in the signs. If I were building a restaurant I wouldn't think twice about putting in a men's restroom and a women's restroom. Although two unisex bathrooms makes more sense now I wouldn't have thought of it before.

dv8n9xc,dv8n9xc,mfDandP,what about the abolitionist movement in the 19th century? were they definitely not about pursuing equality because their aims only affected a certain part of the population?
dv8n9xc,dv8nfgx,ChemiCalChems,"I probably should specify that I'm talking about third-wave feminism here. Women have it better off than men in most cases, but I've never heard a feminist admit this even though they claim that feminism is an equality movement."
dv8n9xc,dv8nkmc_1,mfDandP,"&gt; I can't think of feminism as an equality movement primarily because of its name
Whether you call it feminism or third-wave feminism, I'm addressing this part of your argument, that the narrow focus implied by its name excludes it from the pursuit of equality. By this logic, abolitionists were not pursuing equality either."
dv8n9xc,dv8nqq1_1,ChemiCalChems,"I'm buffering, I'll get back to you in a second, but this has made me think. However, for that logic, I could still call my equality movement ""fuck you all"" and that would be a cool name for it, or anything else of my choice.
Maybe feminism is a valid name for an equality movement, but then I don't believe it to be the optimal name for one."
dv8n9xc,dv8p1tl_1,TheMothHour,"&gt; Maybe feminism is a valid name for an equality movement.
I will totally admit that there are different types of feminism - some more extreme than others. But some forms of feminism is for the equality of women."
dv8n9xc,dv8p1tl_2,TheMothHour,"&gt;I'm talking about third-wave feminisim.
Again, this is a broad group of people and ideas. Some people think that by exposing cultural sexism for one group will expose other sexism in another group. For example, because women are stereotype as the caretakers while men are the providers, women are at a disadvantage when they are the providers while men are at a disadvantage when they take the role of a care giver. IE. It is expected for the man to pay for child support (reguardless if the women makes more) and the man is not usually the primary parent ( even if he wants or should have custody ). In this respect, concepts of feminism can help bring changes that will bring equality to more than women."
dv8n9xc,dv8pexz,ChemiCalChems,"True, but some other areas that don't directly or indirectly affect women aren't handled by feminists, even though the claim that they advocate for the absolute equality for everyone."
dv8n9xc,dv8r130_1,TheMothHour,"Its the whole idea that if one groups paves a path, another group can also use that path. For example, if women talk about flaws in women health and the society, it might open a conversation about men's health. It's an indirect consequence.
So there is a way to meld together egalitarianism and feminism - if you believe in the rights of everyone."
dv8n9xc,dv8r130_2,TheMothHour,"I don't mean to bash egalitarianism but want to point out a weakness in that way of thinking. If you treat everyone as if they are equal, you will fail to understand the individual background. Someone who is from a wealthy family have different needs than someone with a more colorful background. For a culture to be successful for all or ""fair"" for all, it does need to take these differences in consideration."
dv8n9xc,dv8rci9_1,ChemiCalChems,"I mean that everybody is equal in that nobody deserves better treatment than anybody else just because they were born a certain way, be it in the form of privileges or basic rights or prison sentences.
Luck is another matter. One can't argue that hard, lucky workers will have more money to spend on their children."
dv8n9xc,dv8rzvc_1,TheMothHour,"&gt; I mean that everybody is equal in that nobody deserves better treatment than anybody else just because they were born a certain way,
I agree with you but the world isn't there yet. People are treated differently because of their sex, gender, race, class, and a list of other things. Group of people are represented differently which may or may not accurately describe the group or individual."
dv8n9xc,dv8rzvc_2,TheMothHour,So would you agree that people who are in that group would be best at advocating for that group? Would you agree with me that a feminist can advocate for women rights while still allowing for other groups to advocate for them. Just like YOU can advocate for men rights and still agree that women should be treated fairly too. And that my struggles can help me relate to yours.
dv8n9xc,dv8s4ut_1,ChemiCalChems,"I agree so much with you.

4_A,t3_2rnfn0,cognitiveThizzonance,"I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not ""blaming"" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a ""worthwhile endeavor"" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and ""explaining causation"" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as ""part 1"" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term ""causation"" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that ""avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged"", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that ""explaining causation is not victim blaming"", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think ""explaining causation"" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_1,arewar,"Here's the difference.
Something happens to Mary. Mary gets mugged. You response is: ""Well why was she walking through that street at night? That's stupid, she should have known she would get mugged.""
The correct response is: ""Well, that's unfortunate. That's a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area."""
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_2,arewar,Do you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions.
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_3,arewar,"The first just says it's all Mary's fault.
It's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?"
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_4,arewar,"Does the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?
It's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two."
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_5,arewar,"The world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like ""she shouldn't have been there"" we are exactly saying ""This would never happen to me because I would never do that"" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world."
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_6,arewar,"When we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was."
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_7,arewar,"EDIT:
Things got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.
#1. The point of all these examples was this: ""Causation"" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging."
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_8,arewar,"#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation.
#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house."
4_A,t1_cnhjtqq_9,arewar,#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.
4_A,t1_cnhjyfz_1,cognitiveThizzonance,"I agree with what you're saying. I wouldn't support the first statement at all, and I certainly didn't mean to endorse it in my initial post (if indeed I did). If I'd also been mugged in that area, I'd probably tell Mary: ""That's really unfortunate, I also got mugged there. It should be safer, etc. It's really unsafe. I try to stay out of that area."""
4_A,t1_cnhjyfz_2,cognitiveThizzonance,"By keeping with ""I"" language and not placing any blame on her, I make it clear that I choose to stay out of that area because I perceive it as dangerous from past experiences."

The same goes for sexism and other forms of discrimination that generally aren't acceptable in modern society but that we tend to give the Baby Boomers and prior generations a pass on.  The fact that the man in the article is a public figure is the only reason his racism is coming under fire, because if any other old man/woman said the same shit, even the least racist people I know would shrug and say something about not even being worth the confrontation due to them being so old and set in their ways.  I believe that no matter how old you are, you have to live up to the standards of the society you live in *now*, not the one you lived in growing up.

231_A,t1_cm87lw5_1,nickskate,"The thing is that most people, mainly ""intellectuals"" like you, just think the way they are raised to believe by their family, friends or the media. Thats why its understandablr, because elders were raised differently, and most just think the way they were raised too, like most young ppl too, bc old or young most people is retarded"
231_A,t1_cm87lw5_2,nickskate,"Would you like it if the media changed its mind about pedophiles in, say, 50 years old, and youngsters called you a pedophobe ? And dont tell.me that it wont happen because its not the same, because the media can come up with arguments to defend anything"
231_A,t1_cm8a2aq,nickskate,Why dont you do that yourself then and question your values since you judge the elders ?
231_A,t1_cm8ycfs,nickskate,thats like just the only post in which i hadnt been rude lol

450_B,t3_2ikw3y,Corno4825,"I love the Matrix Trilogy. Personal views on acting ability aside, I believe that the premise that the Matrix establishes is one that can only be rivaled by a few movies. The way the stories are told bring forth endless possibilities to the true nature of the film. I also believe that a lot of the hate towards the film comes from the inability to follow the overarching idea.

I do not want to argue the execution of the film (i.e. cast, cgi quality, light use of cords). I only want to argue the structure and intent of the movie. Sequence of events and dialogue between characters are fair game, just not the actor's ability to show any emotion saying them. 

What I am asking is this, did the trilogy make philosophical or logical mistakes big enough that destroy the integrity of the film.

450_B,t1_cl371yt_1,subheight640,"I really hated the pacing of the movies. I hated the actions sequences (which went on for way too long. I want more plot, less action damnit!)
The City of Zion's defense forces also left me shaking my head. Who the hell uses unarmored battle robots, with the obvious weakness of using some unarmored kids running about to reload them? Why the hell don't the evil robots have any sort of long ranged weaponry??? The weapons design is just awful in these movies!"
450_B,t1_cl371yt_2,subheight640,"Not to mention, why the hell is the Matrix so complicated anyways? Why do they need a ""One"" to restart Zion again and again? Why don't they just kill the people that rejected the Matrix and let it be done with?
Similarly, on Neo's little mission to meet the Source, why the fuck didn't the robots just blow Neo out of the sky with a simple heat seeking missile that's not connected to the Matrix? Or if it was their intention to let Neo meet the ""Source"" all along, why waste a bunch of Sentinels?? I guess for the sake of pretty CGI?"
450_B,t1_cl371yt_3,subheight640,"I dunno, I feel like the Matrix movies are just an overly complicated mess. The first was fine, because it was actually a pretty simple movie.

There we go. These are the questions I'm looking for. Some of that sequencing really doesn't make sense now that you point it out. Good job!"
581_B,t3_2fo07m,Thefishlord,"So I was reading in a manga where one person has control over ice and can well it into existence whenever they want (I am avoiding giving the same since I don't know how to spoiler tag and I don't want to give the name away since it's a big deal later) eventually the person develops the ability to freeze time for about 10 or so minutes. This development got me thinking since a lot of people I know think that being able to control fire is (no pun intended) hot shit I Began to think that controlling ice would be much better; reasons ?



Ice only needs water or any liquid to be made so as long as I have anything that has any liquid at on such as nearly every place on earth I can make ice, this is not the same with fire which needs oxygen so If I froze the person in a very compact ice shell the person wouldn't be able to create fire since they would waste all the oxygen and I would just keep reinforcing the shell so 1v1 the ice wins

Second profit: I can freeze time and walk into a bank freeze the vault and then sledgehammer bam no vault door I would be able to see all the lasers due to the mist from the ice so I can dodge lasers and bam I am a billionaire who did it with style. 


Third I would never pay for gas or ships or anything since I can freeze everything I would just sit down in my nice comfortable chair and have an ice dragon which I would make(it's no alive but it pushes me) to take me anywhere.


4th I would be amazing at places where people want cold or cooler temperature If I see a very attractive girl saying gosh I wish it was colder BAM ice man over here I can do that for you and chill the area down like 15 or so degrees that's a guaranteed hello at least also your cooler ran out of ice don't worry BAM cold beers, who is the savior of the alcohol this guy. 


5th personal use: since I would be controlling it I would get used to cold temperatures so when it gets cold to winter guess who gets to go outside shirtless and in shorts since I would be used to the cold


There are obviously more reasons that I will bring up later if asked (I don't know them yet but I will eventually)
So people who would are boring 
pyromancers as opposed to the cool as ice, ice...Cyro...mancers??? Please attempt to CMV 
"
581_B,t1_ckb6wte_1,NuclearStudent,"FYI, normal cyromancers can't stop time. That would be like pyromancers being able to accelerate time and age his enemies.
1. Cryomancers have to worry about trapping themselves in ice. The Last Airbender panicked and froze himself in a glacier. The Human Torch can just blaze up and melt anything in his way."
581_B,t1_ckb6wte_2,NuclearStudent,"I've seen this too many times. An ice wizard becomes over confident and tries to trap the Big Bad in ice, but Big Bad burrows out and steals the woman, laughing.
2 Cryomancers can't burn through armour.
A cryomancer has to freeze a door, look for a fire axe, and spend valuable time chopping. A fire wizard could just burn through the doors."
581_B,t1_ckb6wte_3,NuclearStudent,"3 Pyromancers can pretend to be Satan.
Seriously, that's the best prank ever.
4 Pyromancers have better luck with the girls.
Pyromancers can warm the sensitive regions of girls and arouse them. They can also subtly create warm air currents, and convince girls to move near you. You can also cook with fire, and create amazing muffins and souffles to seduce the ladies with."
581_B,t1_ckb6wte_4,NuclearStudent,"5 Pyromancers are the ultimate survivors.
Is anything broken? Weld it together. Looking for someone? Shoot fire into the air until they find you. Worried about wild animals? They'll smell your smoke and back off. Hungry? Roast a wild animal to perfection. Stuck in the middle of the desert? You don't need water!"
581_B,t1_ckb783v,Thefishlord,Cyromancers can lower the temperature to absolute zero where all motion stops effectively freezing time 
581_B,t1_ckb7d0j,Thefishlord,Also if armor is metal I can make is so cold it would basically freeze onto you 
581_B,t1_ckbnz2j,Thefishlord,Very nice points I like your style of writing and you counter just about every point with an equal reason why pyromancer would be cool I have to give you a delta nicely done sir Δ
846_B,t3_2bk0qs,69_problems,"It probably goes without saying that I support capital punishment, if not in practice then at least in principle.

More than that, I find the outcry sparked from the botched executions of rapists and murderers to be somewhat ridiculous. I find nothing ethically wrong with subjecting a condemned man to some measure of suffering before his death. If someone has killed another person by, say, raping and then burying their victim alive, what makes an hour or two of suffering on their way out so unacceptable?

Since Reddit is largely liberal, I'd expect a healthy response, but let me clarify my position before rebuttals are made:

1. My issue is with the ethics of inflicting pain before execution. I'm perfectly aware and agree that according to law anything more than a swift and painless death would be inhumane and therefore illegal.

2. I'm also assuming that such additional suffering would be administered to admitted and unapologetic killers whose crimes were heinous enough to warrant such action. The uncertainty surrounding most court trials would be enough to keep me from supporting any actual policy for this. This is purely meant to discuss the ethics of the ""ideal situation"".

846_B,t1_cj63kvq,MageZero,"If, as a criminal, you knew that not only could you get the death penalty, but there was a good chance it would involve what you call an hour or two of suffering, wouldn't you rather just try to shoot your way out of an arrest? Then, you might take some cops with you, and have a good chance of dying pretty quickly with relatively less suffering."
846_B,t1_cj64yr9,69_problems,"This is admittedly a different approach, more concerned with practicality than morality or legality. Your ideas have merit, I can see how it would also be necessary to have an ""impersonal"" approach in this way. &amp;#8710;"
1008_A,t3_29cqd5,RobbityBobbity1,"In many superhero TV shows and comics, superheroes are extremely unwilling to kill villains, instead preferring to capture them. Ordinarily, this would be fine, and I think it is for the most part effective against ordinary criminals who are easily contained. When we consider supervillains, we consistently see that they either break free of capture or avoid getting captured in the first place. These villains often go on to pursue other schemes that result in significant harm or death to innocent civilians. If that's the case, then it would be better for heroes to apply lethal force in order to prevent villains from escaping and endangering more lives. Note that this does not always entail killing. A hero would not be justified in killing a villain if merely handicapping that villain would be equally or more effective at preventing harm. My basic argument boils down to:

1. It is justified to use the minimal amount of force necessary to safely prevent a person from infringing on others' rights, provided that the minimal amount is still reasonably proportional to the crime that would be committed (We would permit a John to kill Jack if it was necessary in order to prevent Jack from killing another person, but would not allow John to kill Jack if it were the minimal amount of force necessary to prevent him from stealing $5.)

2. Supervillains often commit crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people. 

3. Crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people warrant the criminal being killed if necessary.

4. Thus, the crimes that supervillains commit warrant them being killed if it is necessary.

5. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is the minimal amount of force to subdue them as capture is not an option.

C. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is morally permissible; obligatory if you think superheroes have a moral obligation to stop villains.

**TL;DR:** Killing or handicapping prevents villains from infringing on others rights better than simple capture does, so superheroes should use those means.

Extra note: I bring up killing because for certain varieties of villains, such as psychic villains like Psimon, magic villains like Loki, or smart villains like Lex Luthor cannot have their relevant abilities handicapped without doing something that is probably about as bad as killing them (granted, I don't know enough about superhero universes to know if there are ways to disable these abilities).

1008_A,t1_cijvb22_1,drphungky,"Let's take your question one more level...why can't cops kill a supervillain when they capture him? Surely it will save lives. They can't because it's not their call to make - that's for the justice system. Otherwise, why can't the cops kill regular criminals? It will lower crime, and repeat offenders will just commit more crime if we don't take care of them. Again - it's not their call."
1008_A,t1_cijvb22_2,drphungky,"You want superheroes to fulfill a role of both lawman AND judge and jury, and there's a reason those powers have been separated historically.
Not many would begrudge the cop who kills in the line of duty when he had no other choice, and I think that's a valid question for superheroes: can I kill if it's the only way to stop someone without turning him over to the justice system? That debate can be answered by the vigilante image issues mentioned elsewhere, but if a hero has a villain subdued, he has no right to alao sentence the villain to death."
1008_A,t1_cik2xc9,RobbityBobbity1,"You seem to be equating law with morality. While in most cases, having these separate duties is important, in these cases, the law has consistently failed to perform its moral preventative duties, and so those duties fall to the next available person: the superhero. If my nextdoor neighbor abuses his or her children or otherwise fails to take care of them, I can't brush it off as not being my responsibility to do something about it. If the government cannot execute its duties to prevent crimes like those committed by supervillains (which killing seems to be the best way to execute that duty), then the duty falls to the superhero who can kill."
1008_A,t1_cikhrk4_1,drphungky,"&gt;You seem to be equating law with morality. While in most cases, having these separate duties is important, in these cases, the law has consistently failed to perform its moral preventative duties, and so those duties fall to the next available person: the superhero.
The law doesn't perform prevention - the police catch the criminals who break the law (or prevent it from being broken), and the justice system punishes, cordons off, or rehabilitates the criminal. The superhero is an answer to the breakdown of the FIRST part of that system - the catching and preventing. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the second half is broken too. If it is, someone who ""rights"" those wrongs is a vigilante at best, self appointed judge, jury and executioner in practice. And most people get uncomfortable with the idea of all that power being given, much less taken, by one individual."
1008_A,t1_cikhrk4_2,drphungky,"&gt;If my nextdoor neighbor abuses his or her children or otherwise fails to take care of them, I can't brush it off as not being my responsibility to do something about it.
No, and turning him into the police, or gathering evidence or protecting his children are all things that a superhero/you could do. But PUNISHING the man, or skipping the ""turning into the police"" part and locking the man in a basement so he can't hurt anyone else isn't your call to make."
1431_B,t3_21rsdj,owlsrule143,"Hi /r/CMV,

I'm a senior in high school, and I have never really been a huge reader. I read one series addictively in 4th grade, The Guardians of Ga'Hoole, and have read various books over the years but have never gotten into it much other than that, especially lately. I got halfway through the Steve Jobs biography last summer and enjoyed it a lot, and plan on finishing it, but haven't had time/motivation so far. I have a couple other books that sound interesting to me but I've never gotten around to. Many people say that reading is really good for you, and important. I consider myself intelligent (not in an arrogant way, but I am intellectual and can handle myself well in academic, philosophical, and logic based conversations, to summarize crudely), and understand that I may enjoy reading when I'm a little older. 

However.. I'm just wondering, is that truly necessary? Is it a necessary fact of life, inevitable for me to fall into, or is it simply society's chosen medium of information and life fulfillment? 

I am not inactive physically or mentally. I do karate, play basketball, baseball, every instrument in my own rock music solo album, I write, I rock climb, I teach karate, I think, I do various forms of yoga including hatha and acro-yoga, and I have discussions and debates with people often. 

I'm sure reading couldn't hurt this list, but it's so painful for me, I just have no desire. I haven't read a single word of my assigned books in school this year, as I preferred to participate in the class discussions and write quality essays based on these discussions. 

Without telling me just that ""reading is good for me"", please change my view by providing a good argument for why I absolutely need to read books, even if it's only during a certain time in my life. 

I should add that I read articles on the Internet all the time, tech related, politics related, whatever reddit force feeds me :P so I have the capacity to read, but I guess I haven't found justification for reading full books so far. To reiterate in a more simple way, is reading just a personal passion that can achieve great benefits, or is it something that everybody needs to do, myself included? (Seeing as I don't have a passion for reading personally).

So reddit, change my view.

1431_B,t1_cgfwfz1_1,Hostilian,"You will not succeed in college if you do not do the reading, especially, *especially* if you're after a liberal arts degree of any kind.* The value of any course worth taking is primarily encoded in the things you will read and the discussions that come out of it. It primes you to be receptive to ideas in subsequent courses."
1431_B,t1_cgfwfz1_2,Hostilian,"You do karate: you can think of a good book as learning new kata for your brain. The learning encoded in a book doesn't itself provide value, but opens up a new space through which your mind (rather than your body) can move. You're learning new intellectual actions from people with more experience in the field than you."
1431_B,t1_cgfwfz1_3,Hostilian,"Which means that not everything you read has equivalent value. The cheap paperbacks in the grocery store are throwaway reading; they contain nothing new for your brain to chew on. Some books are like martial arts charlatans -- they purport to have great new ideas, but most of it's just bullshido. A good nonfiction title, on the other hand, can expose you to a giant box of new ideas -- sometimes, ideas you may not understand or be ready for."

I just assumed that I would suck it up for college but yeah habits don't just suddenly happen in college, that's a little piece of wisdom I've heard. And yes, I definitely agree on books providing a similar knowledge path as forms or curriculum in karate (we actually don't call them kata lol, but I learned that word in the past year from talking to martial artists from around the country, so I understood!), and you made a good argument for it (your writing style), so emotionally I am inclined to agree because your description was vivid and exciting, but logically I am wondering if you have really changed my view. Basically, you made an argument for how reading can enrich my life in a similar way to the other things I already do."

1431_B,t1_cgg2pxh_1,Hostilian,"I'll expand on my previous post a little bit, and then wander around a bit:
Humans are incapable of making large intellectual leaps: we can't think about things we haven't almost thought about already. This is a complicated way of saying that all ""revolutionary"" thought is actually incremental.
For example, humanity didn't start writing novels immediately after the invention of writing. Writing appears to solve the needs of bookkeepers: early manuscripts are for tabulation and accounting. Then for clerical work like laws and records. Eventually it begins to record myths and philosophy: the basis of modern fiction and non-fiction genres."
1431_B,t1_cgg2pxh_2,Hostilian,"Reading the about the incremental thoughts of others drags us into areas of thought that we were previously *unable* to think about. [Robin Sloan](http://www.robinsloan.com/) reviewed [Jeff Vandermeer's novel Annihilation](http://snarkmarket.com/2014/8236) on Snarkmarket recently and wrote something really incisive:
&gt; Have you ever played one of those collectible card games? Bought a pack of cards, ripped it open, added them to your deck? Annihilation is a foil-wrapped booster pack for weird fiction, loaded with truly original images. Truly original entities.
The book is pretty weird. But the set pieces of the story are a hoist into new *kinds* of stories, which are also new ways of thinking. They're a shortcut into thinking about things you haven't thought about before."
1431_B,t1_cgg2pxh_3,Hostilian,"-----
Almost everyone in the western world tells themselves the same stories about the world. Things fit into a few basic stories, and if they don't, the world doesn't make sense.
There's a theory of literature that states that there are only really three stories that people tell each other, and one of them is a combination of the other two: someone goes on an adventure; someone new comes to town; and, someone gets married."
1431_B,t1_cgg2pxh_4,Hostilian,"Joseph Cambell wrote [A Hero With a Thousand Faces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces), a book that outlines what's called [the monomyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth). Every civilization tells itself this story, and it's deeply encoded into our understanding of how stories are told. [Star Wars](http://vimeo.com/19447662#t=3m15s) is the perfect example of a monomyth retelling.
Almost all the media out there -- any media that requires significant money to make, anyway -- is going to play to the monomyth or other story-conventional stereotypes. Look at the movie Avatar: anyone who has seen the similar repackaging of the same story could predict every act and every scene of the entire movie. And yet it ranks as one of the most successful movies *of all time*."
1431_B,t1_cgg2pxh_5,Hostilian,"The point of all this is that the thing you think of as ""*me*"" is the product of a lot of gentle programming provided by the media you interact with. Most of that media is derivative and simplistic. The smartest, most revolutionary, most complex programming -- the stuff that gets you from a dusty Pentium 3 to a blazing-fast supercomputer -- is in a book. A lot of it is also really old."

I'm not advocating that everyone needs to be a voracious book-reader. I'm not. I probably read four books for pleasure last year, and I've abandoned more books than I've finished.
I also don't think that books are the only source of good reading: I'm always on the lookout for expansive content-dense websites that contain interesting information that I've never seen before. Wikipedia is alright, although pretty dry. I love it when I stumble on infoblobs like Winchell Chung's [Atomic Rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/index.php), Marc MacYoung's [No Nonsense Self Defense] (http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com/), or [Epicurus.net](http://epicurus.net/).

2073_B,t3_1onlj1,TheScienceGuy2,"So i have seen this type of post before on CMV and i would like to just put a few more points out and try and figure this out for myself. I am going to make my points bullet form so the are easy to respond to. Also just before i start i want to make it clear that that i have 100% respect for the troops of WW1 and WW2 because those wars involved mandatory service, and real threats to the safety of the planet. Also I respect the troops as human beings, just not for their possible view/actions. Anyways my points are these.
&gt;1. **When you look at war from a countries point of view, it makes sense why people would think they are fighting for the ""right""(patriotism and lies about motives) how do you KNOW that you are fighting for the right? Every time a soldier comes home for your country, one doesn't come home from another country. It all seems so pointless and primal when looked at through a global perspective**.
&gt;2. **I've seen alot of soldiers state that they are there for peaceful purposes, and if that is the case, why don't we have a peacekeeping organization that can be signed up for opposed to the military. In my opinion, 2 organizations seperated like this would have completely different view on how to handle situations. If we do have an organization like this, why not join that**?
&gt;3. **I just don't see how going in to kill people can be respected, especially when they are sometimes innocent, a classic example is the ""collateral damage"" video, where it is very clear they are not there for peaceful purposes**.
&gt;4. **Is there any points to the wars we are in right now, other than money for the contractors and equipment providers? War is a major driver of this terrible economic system, and without it, millions of people wouldn't have jobs. It seems that it is kept around solely for the purpose of keeping the economy running**.

Thank you for reading, I know my beliefs could be seen as radical and I thank you for all your response.

**Edit**: People have wanted me to clarify my title, so by the ""mindset of the troops"" i mean to say the underlying principles/values that the military seems to hold. Such as Violence is an alright way to solve problems and killing is ok. People that i am around that want to join the military don't seem to be very down to earth, and are more about joining because of the guns and toughness of being in the military, so maybe that is where my bias arises. "
2073_B,t1_ccu8ayh_1,cleaningotis,""" how do you KNOW that you are fighting for the right?""
In Iraq fighting against groups that are responsible for ethnic cleansing and encouraging political reconciliation between dissident groups so they can disagree peacefully earns the moral high ground.
In Afghanistan the Taliban are not in the business of winning ""hearts and minds"", or giving the Afghans better quality of life, they are in the business of reconquering the country, and in the process have been absolutely brutal. I recall story when in Nuristan province a U.S. commander was having a shura with local tribal elders who were fence sitting. He simply asked them ""Who do you think has a better vision for Afghanistan, the Taliban or us?"" The answer is obvious. You can disagree with the political motivations for going to war in the first place, but in terms of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan you will have an impossible time trying to prove that the intentions and efforts of the occupying forces doesn't hold the moral high ground as opposed to the opposition they face."

2073_B,t1_ccu8ayh_3,cleaningotis,"Modern counter insurgency conflicts are not just military operations any more, its a massive spectrum of tasks and goals that go into rehabilitating a failed state in addition to whatever challenges the insurgency faces. In Iraq and Afghanistan, because of the nature and goal of the wars, there were dozens of organizations both American and non-governmental international organizations working on the ground. But the fundamental problem is that it is a warzone, the security situation is the first concern to be addressed, and humanitarian work cannot commence if there is no semblance of security. In Afghanistan and Iraq humanitarian workers for non military organizations have been killed and kidnapped by insurgents, construction contractors as well. A famous incident was Al Qaeda bombing  the headquarters of the U.N. Assistance mission in Iraq in 2003, which killed the U.N. high commissioner for human rights Sergio de Mello. The role of the soldier in these recent wars hasn't been solely to drop firepower, it has been to provide population security, facilitate good governance, political mediation, and improving the local economy through reconstruction funds, to name a few of the hats that soldiers have been made to wear."
2073_B,t1_ccu8ayh_4,cleaningotis,"""I just don't see how going in to kill people can be respected, especially when they are sometimes innocent, a classic example is the ""collateral damage"" video, where it is very clear they are not there for peaceful purposes.""
The collateral murder video has been twisted by wikileaks and popular opinion into an atrocity when in fact it is adhering to proper rules of engagement, but the most important thing to realize is context. I frequent /r/combatfootage, one of the most important things to understand of viewing videos of this sort is that the people being filmed have a far higher degree of situational awareness than the viewer does. And in war, because there is no such thing as perfect opportunities or perfect situational awareness, the most logical decision can be to drop firepower, and you can still be at fault for killing innocent noncombatants. But the mistake you made is that you cannot characterize an entire war effort based on one video of combat footage, it takes an depth understanding of the history of the conflict to make a wholesome judgement."

2073_B,t1_ccu8ayh_6,cleaningotis,"The Iraq war ended in 2011, Afghanistan is set to end at the end of 2014 but there will likely be an American residual presence. When it comes to discussing what to do during war, what needs to happen is an intelligent discussion of interests and resources, not a knee jerk reaction in the spirit of American isolationism. Many people in the military and intelligence community included, in hindsight, view the Iraq war as a strategic mistake. But once inside the country, regardless of the motivations to invade, the American military was responsible for the well being of the Iraqi people. The occupation remained longer than expected because Iraq had descended into chaos, Al Qaeda sparked a religious civil war that took the form of ethnic cleansing campaigns by bombing one of the most holy mosques in Shia Islam in Feb 2006. This civil war is what accounts for the hundreds of thousands of civilian dead. The mission of the Iraq war was redefined to much more modest terms, to basically leave the country in a semi normal state of security as well as to foster political reconciliation between dissident groups and insurgents so the Iraqis could figure out there difference via politics rather than communal war, as well as destroyed Al Qaeda in Iraq. All these objectives were met by the surge that was implemented in 2007 which facilitated the sunni tribal ""awakening"" which began in late 2006."
2073_B,t1_ccu8ayh_7,cleaningotis,"In terms of Afghanistan it was the war that was started after 9/11 to attack Al Qaeda, after the initial campaign Al Qaeda and the Taliban were hurt badly but fled to Pakistan's western frontier province, where they still reside today. Pakistan with strong encouragement from the U.S. has tried to invade this area but because they are an incompetent military and horrible counter insurgents, each major operation was a failure that ended in ceasefires that strongly favored the insurgents. The Pakistani military and government has essentially no influence in this region anymore. Personally, I think that there should be a residual force in Afghanistan because of the fact that that area in Pakistan is the safe haven of many terrorist and insurgent organizations, not just Al Qaeda or the Taliban. And I don't think the Afghan military or government is capable enough to hold off the Taliban."
2073_B,t1_ccu8ayh_8,cleaningotis,"In terms of economy the money that gets pumped into a war effort is more than just weapons. Especially in counter insurgency wars, the type of wars that Afghanistan and Iraq became after the brief initial conventional operations, there isn't as much utility for expensive munitions and assets like tanks or strategic bombers or warships, since there is no conventional military style force to destroy. http://www.militaryindustrialcomplex.com/ This site reports all DoD contracts. If you browse, very few have anything to do with weapons development or procurement. As to why the wars were so expensive, I haven't yet investigated it thoroughly, but the logistical needs of maintaining occupations simply beyond ammunition and ordinance is substantial. When fighting counter insurgency wars, there is a phrase that ""money is ammunition"", so for these conflicts commanders on the ground have had discretionary budgets to fund development projects. I believe the Defense Department accounts for around 20-25% of the annual federal budget for the past ten years, but only 3-5% of the national GDP."

2220_A,t3_1lj77i,Napalm4Kidz,"By ""single use restroom"" I mean a public restroom with a lockable door that allows only one occupant at a time. I don't know if these are common all over the world but they are very common in the United States

Now, I understand the advantages of a single use restroom. They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user. However, at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice. The most convincing argument I've read against unisex restrooms is that some people are uncomfortable urinating/defecating around the opposite sex, but this doesn't apply to single use restrooms since the occupant is alone anyway.

What if there are five women in line for a single use restroom, but no men? That line of women could be moving twice as fast if they had two restrooms available. Unfortunately for them, the other restroom is only for men, so they're just going to have to hold it.

This restriction strikes me as totally arbitrary. It has an obvious downside with no notable upsides that I can see. That said, I've already had /r/changemyview flip my opinion several times when I really wasn't expecting it to. Maybe there are some points I haven't considered."

2407_B,t3_1io050,deterra,"I think the whole way of ""life"" of the Borg seems pretty great. They have all they need, they have a telos, and they strike me as more possible for humanity to achieve than the peace required by the Federation.

To the first point, that they have all their needs taken care of and have an arsenal and quick, global hive learning which renders them nearly indestructible. Death is no object because life is in service to the hive and corpses are taken up for resources and information.

The second point is pretty cool. The whole of the Borg is driven by a sense of purpose--approaching perfection through incorporating greater intelligence and diversity into themselves. While individual humans have senses of purpose, the whole of humanity has no agreed-upon purpose and human conflict is the result. The Borg are internally peaceful.

The third point, that it is a likelier future for humanity than the Federation, I base in part on the accelerating returns of technology. We already have human brain-to-computer interfacing and rat brain-to-brain interfacing. With cloud computing as well, it is looking pretty likely that sooner or later we will have internet-facilitated human brain-to-brain interfacing. I consider the singularity an inevitability barring nuclear holocaust or environmental collapse, while the peace required of a Federation member I consider highly unlikely from a non-hivemind humanity.

Two elements of the Borg I expect to come up here:

Individuality. Rather, the lack of it. Though I have it and enjoy it, for the Borg it is a non-issue. It is a tradeoff, initially, to be sure, individuality for a hive mind, but afterward, the Borg are no more aware of individuality than are our individual neurons. It is a clumsiness shed in favour of a larger system with loftier goals higher purposes, and greater abilities to realize those goals and purposes. The individuals of the Borg act like the hands and eyes and neurons of a larger organism, not as independent specimens, so I consider it insufficient to say ""I don't want to be a Borg person"". There is no such thing. Your consciousness and identity are those of the hive. Your body is no longer tied to your personhood.

Secondly, violence. Assimilation sounds pretty bad, no? But in First Contact we learn that the Borg do not just kidnap and plug in, and that's the end. They kidnap, and forcefully expose lifeforms to the benefits of the Collective, and await free choice to join or not.

Even so, this is extremely violent. It is not injurious to the person (on the contrary, it is empowering!). It doesn't change human history, but only human future. And the new human future would be one in which, on top of our own creativity and intellect, we can capitalize on that if others too, and even other species.

So, I believe the Borg to be a better (and likelier) future for humanity than a (mostly) peaceful Federation of Planets. Change my view."

**BORG QUEEN:** You flatter yourself. I've overseen the assimilation of countless millions. You were no different.
**PICARD:** You're lying. You wanted more than just another Borg drone. You wanted a human being with a mind of his own, who could bridge the gulf between humanity and the Borg. You wanted a counterpart, but I resisted. I fought you."

2407_B,t1_cb6cyg7_1,TheDarkBagel,"I think this is the key line of dialogue that infers otherwise:
PICARD: Offering myself? ...That's it. I remember now. It wasn't enough that you assimilate me. I had to give myself freely to the Borg, ...to you.

I think Picard is talking about how the queen wanted a unique drone (""You wanted a counterpart"") out of Picard, remember they were trying to make a diplomat/leader out of him? Likewise, Data is meant to be similar. In other words, something distinct from a drone, as is inferred by the queen stating that Picard is no different than other drones (in that he was assimilated despite his free will), to which Picard responds that his case was different because she wanted ""more than just another Borg drone"". All this seems to point to that drones are not given choice and that Picard and Data were unique."
2407_B,t1_cb6cyg7_3,TheDarkBagel,"If Picard did want to be a Borg, he would have willingly gone back to the collective after being turned human again. But the whole film is premised on Picard's intense dislike for the Borg.

2407_B,t1_cb6ij1a_1,TheDarkBagel,"Well, it's an organization the coerces individuals into things they don't consent to, removing essential parts of conscious existence. The fact most Borg don't care they are a Borg is besides the point, since a dead person doesn't care they are dead or a lobotomized person care they are lobotomized. In those matters we are more concerned with what individuals consent to before those states."
2407_B,t1_cb6ij1a_2,TheDarkBagel,"They also have difficulty inventing new things, and primarily copy other things (I think this was the premise of Scorpion? They couldn't alter their nanoprobes to defend themselves against an alien race and allied with Voyager to do it for them). It's likely because they lack the autonomy required to invent; lacking things like creativity, instinct, insight, maybe even just the ability to brain storm? So ultimately it's questionable if perfection might be achievable, unless the combination of all technologies made it so. They are more akin to collage artists than inventors."
2407_B,t1_cb6jl9i_1,deterra,"If the Borg assimilated all of humanity, do you not expect they would assimilate also the creativity, instinct, insight, and brainstorming power you refer to?  Of course!  They are more interested in this than in our bodies (or our consent).
I do agree with your argument that it is coercive, and you've phrased it very persuasively.  But we also force children to get an education.  In many nations, we also force taxes upon workers for health care, infrastructure, and pensions.  There is still no consent.  Some people actively rebel against it!  But there's little arguing against the fact that, done well, free education and universal health care are not only an improvement to society, but one so vast that our ancestors from as little as 200 years ago couldn't fathom the benefits we reap from them today.  These benefits we gained, and continue to gain, by coercion."
2407_B,t1_cb6kx36_1,TheDarkBagel,"&gt;If the Borg assimilated all of humanity, do you not expect they would assimilate also the creativity, instinct, insight, and brainstorming power you refer to? Of course!
Not sure how you might infer this? The Borg have already assimilated billions of sentient beings (for example, they assimilated 11 billion of just **one** species - 6339), many of which probably already have those abilities considering the similarities in species in Star Trek's universe. The Borg seem good at replicating technology, but evolving in ""human"" ways appears extremely difficult for them, particularly because they need to retain an iron grip on the hive. Further, the fact they can't innovate to begin with is kind of a catch-22 with stuff already out of their reach. Do you have any reasoning to back up your claim, it sounds like you're fairly certain?"
2407_B,t1_cb6kx36_2,TheDarkBagel,"&gt; In many nations, we also force taxes upon workers for health care, infrastructure, and pensions. There is still no consent.
How are these things first put into motion? In most countries they are done through a process of **elections**, utilizing the **choice** of the people. Due to the nature of society we can't implement rules to appease all individuals, so it works in the spirit of majority rules. It's a very big difference in comparison to the Borg."
2407_B,t1_cb6ugvx_1,deterra,"my view has been changed, somewhat.  Together with /u/evercharmer, you've made me feel that while *being* the Borg sounds optimal, being forcefully assimilated sounds pretty terrible.  Perhaps if the Borg just said ""Join us for better everything"" and people joined willingly, I'd have no qualms, but together, you have made forceful assimilation look inexcusable (not in itself, but because it destroys one of the aspects of humanity which is most valuable: independence of choice)."

2641_B,t3_1ekme5,SilkyTheCat,"Hi, I recently completed a degree in philosophy.  When I had the opportunity to engage with my philosophy professor's research I always found it valuable, if not also interesting.  Some problems in formal logic, for example, bear immediate importance to issues in subjects like computer programming and math.  Even philosophy that doesn't seem as 'useful,' such as aesthetics and metaphysics, seems valuable insofar as it is the pursuit of an accurate understanding of reality at a very foundational level. 

But I've never encountered this kind of value in the research of English professors.  To use cliché examples, I don't see how themes of death in Hamlet, or the role of silence in Attic Greek tragedies, valuably informs our understanding of the universe, or gives us any 'practical' benefit.  These interests do not seem like the sort of thing that major research institutions should fund in the large-scale way that they do now.  In some institutions, for example, there are well over a hundred tenure-level English professors.  I don't see why most of these professors ought not be phased out and replaced with professional lecturers.  Their work seems interesting as a hobby - I think that many people could discuss the role of silence in Greek tragedy for hours if they wanted - but I don't think that it's valuable on the level of philosophy, physics, math, anthropology, etc.

I'm sorry to be so vague about what I mean by 'value' here.  I was hoping that you folks could help me work that out if you can.  Thanks :)"
2641_B,t1_ca15czv_1,[deleted],"I'd argue that literary research can be very valuable from a historical and anthropological perspective since written text can offer some of the best insight into past cultures. Especially when we get back to the very ancient writings, like the Aeind, there's so much we can learn about the culture that produced it (in fact, I've seen university course devoted to discussing what we've learned about Greek and Roman culture, science, and philosophy from the Odyssey and the Aenid)."
2641_B,t1_ca15czv_2,[deleted],"A lot of the Greek tragedies, especially something like Oedipus or Antigone, were very moralistic and would also deal with religion. They act as an excellent source for understanding which qualities (intelligence, strength, wit, etc.) were valued in those cultures and what was thought of religion (free will v. control by the Gods, unconditionally good v. flawed Gods etc.)."
2641_B,t1_ca15czv_3,[deleted],"Even with more modern literature, the same applies: I just wrote a research paper for my lit class in school discussing how Dracula is a reflection of changing societal views towards sexuality in the Victorian era. In doing my research for this paper, every single academic article didn't just talk about the novel, but included information about how it helped us understand how people of the time reacted to the social climate. Going further with Dracula, it was written during a period of huge change – along with the growth of feminism, there was amazing technological and medical growth and the rise of nationalism, and by analyzing Dracula, you can see not just what happened, but how more or less ordinary people reacted to it emotionally."
2641_B,t1_ca1i2mr_1,[deleted],"I'd agree that literary criticism isn't our greatest source of historical information. And I wouldn't call understanding the past the primary goal of literary criticism either. Rather, I was pointing out a potential practical application of the field.
I would say, however, that literature adds on to and supplements what we already know from sociology, anthropology, etc. and can be invaluable as a historical source. As an example, comparative literary analysis of *The Epic Of Gilgamesh* and various religious texts has been used as evidence for the spread of knowledge out of Mesopotamia in ancient times."
2641_B,t1_ca1i2mr_2,[deleted],"Also, understanding of literature helps us understand people's emotional responses to historical events, rather than just presenting us with what happened. I'd wager that many historical documents don't offer this sort of insight."

3250_A,t1_counjd7_1,wahtisthisidonteven,"A college education need not always go hand-in-hand with a large amount of student debt. A responsible approach to your education would allow you to achieve your goals without taking out debts that you may be unable to pay back.
That means looking towards other methods to pay for schooling that aren't debt (using funds from work, grants, or scholarships), looking into cheap schooling options (testing out of general education or attending community college), and perhaps even responsible loans based on a realistic analysis of your future earning potential. You could even look at work-study programs or the military as a route to low-debt education."
3576_A,t3_3gri3k,IWriteWithATalon,"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (""It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies"") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that ""Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options"".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (""Massage parlors""). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

**What I would not like to see:**

-Outright moral arguments (""Selling your body is wrong"", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions (""Women will be forced into sex slavery"")

-Religious arguments

Thanks for your time :3

3576_A,t1_cu0sztg,MrCapitalismWildRide,"I agree that sex work should be legal, but your methods don't seem like they would be sufficient for harm reduction. Because of the high up front cost of running and regulating a brothel, you'd see them institute a robust hiring process that would screen out many current sex workers for a variety of reasons, perhaps most commonly the fact that they arE homeless, undocumented, or simply  won't look ""good"" enough to attract brothel customers. So you'll still have a thriving trade of street based sex work etc. that will actually provide exactly zero extra protection for the sex workers who will still be a exactly as much risk of being thrown in jail as they were before legalization."
3576_A,t1_cu0tpnt_1,IWriteWithATalon,"Oh of course, it isn't meant as an *immediate* fix, like it would happen overnight. More a long-term fix; prostitutes will become less desirable as street walkers, because of the fact that safer, legal, and generally less-risky options would become available (the brothels). This would hopefully *drastically* reduce the amount of illegitimate cash flowing, reducing the profitability of it to both pimps and prostitutes. Over time the prostitutes that didn't have STDs and were otherwise viable candidates would ideally transition to legal sex work, or other avenues. Then the remaining prostitutes/pimps would eventually be starved out by a reduction in their trade and a harsher mentality on those committing the crimes; rather than being seen as victims or forced workers they would be a public liability and a disease risk on top of all other concerns."

edit: The thesis of your post is ""Just because you are angry, you can't put this kind of person in power. It makes you worse than anyone running in this race right now.""  But what you are missing is that I *am not* putting this kind of person in power. My own vote does not make me responsible for the votes of everyone else. If I vote for Gloria la Riva or Jill Stein or Gary Johnson because I think they'll do the best job as President, and everyone else votes for Trump, and he wins, then that *sucks*.

You can choose to euthanize the old dogs who you've grown to know and love, or the puppies that are adorable, or the middle aged dogs that are energetic but don't poop on everything. You have to choose some of them, or many will have a worse death of starvation. There's no palatable answer, but you have to make a choice anyway. It's hard. And that's life."

dlaegwg,dlaegwg_1,Literally_Herodotus,"&gt;Most critically, as I see it this is not a race issue. It's an issue of a culture
What's the line you're drawing between ""race"" and ""culture"" here? Surely you recognize, even if you think race isn't entirely cultural, that a large part of what we understand socially as race is tied up in culture, yes?"
dlaegwg,dlaegwg_2,Literally_Herodotus,"If you identify ""an issue of culture"" that you tie explicitly to a particular racial group, then sorry, but that does make your perceived issue one of race.
&gt;it's not unique to black people nor does it affect all of them. You'll notice that two of the perpetrators in exhibit 4 are white, along with possibly others in exhibits 6-176.
Then why would you call it an issue of ""black culture""? You seem to be arguing for an influence of what you understand to be black ""thug"" culture on the white people who live in primarily black areas, but you've given no reason for thinking that this is the root cause of the problem."
dlaegwg,dlaegwg_3,Literally_Herodotus,"&gt;As I said, this is a problem of culture. Portions of it may be due to anti-intellectualism, neglect of family, general lack of care for others, lack of ambition or motivation to improve one's life, lack of respect for the law, lack of self-restraint, or more. I'm not even going to try to explain the depth of it, because I don't know it. Nor do I know how it could could even begin to be repaired. And I realize that the culture is neither exclusive nor universal to black people, but I can't think of a better term for this culture. It seems to go beyond just ""thug life.""
So here you're basically saying you don't *know* what the root cause of the problem is, but simultaneously insist it has to do with ""black culture."""
dlaegwg,dlaegwg_4,Literally_Herodotus,"&gt;But right now nobody will even talk about this, because to do so will instantly have you be branded a racist.
Yes, it is in fact racist to lay the blame for a problem you explicitly acknowledge you don't really understand on some amorphous and poorly defined notion of ""black culture."" Sorry, but there's no getting around that."
dlaegwg,dlaex5x_1,awaythrow11211,"&gt;What's the line you're drawing between ""race"" and ""culture"" here?
Race is genetic, and utterly immutable. Among other reasons, that's a big part of why racism is so horrible. People born black can't choose to become white. Culture, however, is not. Cultural attitudes can change, and people who are born into a shitty culture can, with effort and self-awareness, shed that. While the two are strongly correlated, there's no causal link between the two."
dlaegwg,dlaex5x_2,awaythrow11211,"&gt;If you identify ""an issue of culture"" that you tie explicitly to a particular racial group, then sorry, but that does make your perceived issue one of race.
It absolutely does *not*. Race and culture are distinct. The problem with the black youths in these videos is not the color of their skin, it is their upbringing."
dlaegwg,dlaex5x_3,awaythrow11211,"&gt;Then why would you call it an issue of ""black culture""?
I call it that out of convenience, because there is a strong correlation (not causation)."
dlaegwg,dlaex5x_4,awaythrow11211,"If you cannot understand the difference between race (a person's genetic ancestry) and culture (the attitudes and values that surround them in the present), then I have no idea how I would even counter-argue with you."

While the two are strongly correlated, there's no causal link between the two.
No, ""race"" is social/cultural and actually has nothing to do with genetics. This is basic sociology."
dlaegwg,dlaf42e_2,Literally_Herodotus,"At this point I have to say your entire view is based in a faulty understanding of the issue at hand (race), and the fact that you're reacting with incredulity that I'm considering race and culture as linked rather than distinct indicates that you don't have the *faintest* clue what you're talking about, since the overwhelming academic consensus is that they are, in fact, linked."
dlaegwg,dlafumw,awaythrow11211,"Perhaps you're right, but educating me about the precise semantics does absolutely nothing to change my view."
dlaegwg,dlag2qw_1,Literally_Herodotus,"Given the pains you were at to present your view as not racist, in virtue of your argument being about culture and not race, I think it's a bit more than a matter of semantics to get you to admit that your view might be about race after all.
Regardless, that wasn't even my substantive argument against your view, it just happens to be the only thing in my original comment you focused on."
dlaegwg,dlb67c7_1,Literally_Herodotus,"Since my initial post I have literally only talked about this in response to the zillion people who have responded to me to me about it. You yourself have replied multiple times to different comments I've made to say essentially the same thing.
But since you're so eager to call me out for talking about it too much, I'll go ahead and not respond to anything else you have to say to me about this topic. I assume that's what you want."
dlaegwg,dlbq4o6,hedic,"Ok I'll bite. Race is a social construct as well as a hard generic one. I'm against shitty race based cultures. 

Ok what now. How does that admission move the conversation along towards a solution to the effects of a violent culture."
dlaegwg,dlbqck7,Literally_Herodotus,"No, because you're still assuming the effect is the specific culture in question, when you haven't given any reason to think it doesn't have to do with wider social, economic, geographic, or historical factors - which, of course, you have conceded are part of what goes into making up ""race"" in the first place."
dlaegwg,dlc74qg,hedic,"The effects are coming from a specific culture. Yes that culture was created by social, financial, historical, and genetic influences. That's not OPs question. 

There is a big culture in the USA that is overly violent. Why and how do we deal with it?"
dlaegwg,dlc8m5x_1,Literally_Herodotus,"Addressing social factors that contribute to it like systemic poverty and disproportionate police action against African Americans?
Or even if you don't believe those are contributing factors, I'm a little perplexed that you simultaneously seem to concede that there are social factors outside of the particular makeup of black individuals themselves that foster this problem, but then don't seem to think it's a problem with a social solution."

That would explain both of our confusion. Nobody said that. I was wondering why you were following that logical path.

Trouble is, what people call a human race is a special unique configuration. You can name things, like bone structure, skin tone, and any other, but they are not bound to any of the others.
As in, you can have a scandinavian ability to drink milk, with dark skin, epicanthic fold and be very short or very tall. The different things have nothing to do with each-other.

He admitted to drinking, partying, and doing stupid things as a teenager."
e7boprr,e7boprr_2,RuroniHS,"The only things he could be potentially called on for lying was the odd terminology in his yearbook that he said wasn't sexual. However, further investigation produced *several* witnesses who were able to corroborate his testimony -- unlike Ford -- that those terms were not sexual in nature. A quick look on urban dictionary reveals that ""boofing"" is one of two things: buttchugging, or farting. None of the definitions are sexual. This corroborates his claim. Multiple witnesses stepped forward to claim that ""Devil's Triangle"" was, indeed, a drinking game. The details of their description actually matched his description of the game; if he were lying, you would expect some kind of discrepancy in the details, but it was spot on. This corroborates his claim. And ""Alumnium"" is probably the least sexy sounding thing I've ever heard passed off as a sex term. The etymology of it suggests something of a graduation buddy, which makes sense because they were graduating, and fits with Kavanaugh's description of ""best friend."""

But, if we're disregarding testimony, I guess Ford is even more of a perjurer because she has *less* corroborating evidence than Kavanaugh at this point.

Now, I am not jealous or insecure when it comes to my relationships but I think that emotionally and definitely physically the connection to one person comes from being with that one person.

I will reply more limited to those that still choose to comment but thanks because I not only understand the POV I must say I suppose I have actually changed my view. :)

TL;DR: I think open relationships are bullshit CMV
EDIT: My view was changed.

225_B,t1_cmc2p7e_1,shadmock,"The only thing I can offer is my own experience.
Before I encountered polyamory, I had a lot of relationships end in resentment because I fell in love with someone else while in a serious relationship. Mind you, I felt no less love for the person I was in a committed relationship with and I never would have acted upon those feelings. It was painful for me, but I'm not one of those people that gets off on illicit romance and cheating."
225_B,t1_cmc2p7e_2,shadmock,"When I learned about open relationships (I was single at the time), I realized that it was the only relationship style that really resonated with me.
Today, I have a very committed partner and we've been happily together for about seven years now. We live together, share a bank account, and he's on my insurance. I genuinely believe that we will be together for years more, maybe even for life. I have also had long-term romantic relationships outside of this one. My last partner lasted three years, ended amicably, and is someone that I consider one of the closest and best friends I have ever had."
225_B,t1_cmc2p7e_3,shadmock,"I have recently started dating another person and I could definitely see it becoming long-term. It's been a little over three months since we began seeing each other and we haven't yet had sex, so the sexytimes on the side thing is pretty much ruled out. I'm definitely smitten with this guy and suspect that it could even become love pretty easily at this point. As for his existing relationships, he has a wife and child, and they live with his wife's committed partner. They are very much a family and I feel completely welcomed and cared about in their home."
225_B,t1_cmc2p7e_4,shadmock,"The point is, I guess, that this has in no way changed my relationship with my live-in partner (I refer to him as my anchoring partner). We still have sex the same amount, cuddle and watch movies, do chores together, and even bicker about the little things just as much. It takes nothing away from us and he is actually my closest confidante and best friend. He is really happy to hear me gush about the giddiness that the other person makes me feel."
225_B,t1_cmc2p7e_5,shadmock,"For me, the connections just multiply the love I feel and add to my chosen family."
225_B,t1_cmc7vy9_1,Caligirlsrock,Damn. Another well said one. I appreciate you sharing your actual experience. I actually like the idea of the non-traditional family and grew up in a blended one myself. Although that has become a norm in the States I can see how down the pike perhaps what you are describing will become more of a normalcy as well. The way you described sounds pretty good - I still feel like it's not for me but you definitely explained it in a way where I understand the POV of someone with several SOs and children and spouses are involved and that was more what I was looking for.

441_B,t1_cl4nafc_1,BenIncognito,"&gt; i'm against feminism simply because it's the 'advocacy of women's rights' and not the 'advocacy of men's and women's rights'.
Are you against LGBT advocacy groups for the same reason? What about advocacy groups for people of color?"
441_B,t1_cl4nafc_2,BenIncognito,"Why does feminism need to advocate for men's rights? It isn't about men's rights. If men want an advocacy group that focuses on their rights they are free to start one.
&gt; I understand that most feminists want equal rights in regards of both sexes but i can't sign off on a ideology, that by definition, focuses solely on women.
Why not? What's the problem with an ideology that focuses on women? Do you think feminism prevents feminists from *also* advocating for men's rights? Because it doesn't, people who are feminists can also advocate for men's rights just like people who are LGBT advocates can advocate for straight people's rights. It's just easier to get things done politically if your group has a focus. That's why feminism has been successful in the past and I see no reason to change that."

Why does a group with a specific focus have to advocate for everyone? Why can't it have a focus?"

But by definition it's the advocacy of women's rights, I don't want to call myself a feminist when the name doesn't reflect my opinions.
I think, by definition, feminism advocates for *gender equality* which does include both sexes (how can you make women equal to men without making men equal to women?) it's just that modern feminism tends to focus more on how society views gender as a whole and shouldn't hold people to gender stereotypes - and this is how they end up advocating for men's rights (in a roundabout way)."
441_B,t1_cl4nafc_5,BenIncognito,"But again, why can't men form their own group to advocate for their own rights? Is this not what the men's rights movement is all about?

1513_B,t3_20iv9v,AgentCC,"I think that what we're seeing here is democracy when it's convenient.  Ukraine decided to break apart from the Soviet Union, and that's fine; but if the Crimea doesn't want to be a part of the Ukraine and they win a referendum (2/3 majority) to become a part of Russia, I don't see anything wrong with that.  

To do otherwise, is extremely shortsighted in my view, because Ukraine is going to have a restive province on their hands with a powerful backer making a military crackdown/ occupation inevitable.  Further down the road we may see something akin to an IRA develop.  This blood will not only be on the hands of Ukrainians but the UN as well since they seek to deny them their democratic voice in the recent referendum.  

However, I do have one caveat in this case:  I think that a simple majority would not be sufficient to give Crimea to Russia.  It would have to be a 2/3 supermajority.    "
1513_B,t1_cg3y5m7_1,learhpa,"I have no problem in concept with the idea of Crimea choosing to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, although I think that they should *also* allow sub-regions of Crimea to secede from Crimea.
I am skeptical of Russia's involvement because Russia does *not* allow Chechnya, Dagestan, and other disaffected regions of Russia to secede from Russia."
1513_B,t1_cg3y5m7_2,learhpa,"I think *this particular* referendum is completely illegitimate. It was authorized by the Crimean Parliament when the Parliament was occuppied by a foreign military force, and it was conducted *after two weeks* - which is hardly enough time for a reasoned debate. (Compare to the long debate periods for the Scottish secession referendum of this year or the Quebecois secession referendum of years past)."
1513_B,t1_cg3y5m7_3,learhpa,Process is really important for something like this; secession is a big deal. Allowing everyone time to fully debate the merits rather than calling a snap election (held basically as soon as the ballots could be printed) should be a prerequisite to such an election being considered legitimate.
1513_B,t1_cg4c7up_1,AgentCC,"&gt;I am skeptical of Russia's involvement because Russia does not allow Chechnya, Dagestan, and other disaffected regions of Russia to secede from Russia.
This goes directly back to my comment of ""democracy when it's convenient"" and is a splendid case in point of Russian hypocricy.  I grant thee a delta [&amp;#8710;].  I also fully agree with your point of allowing more time for adequate debate especially if the parliament called for the snap vote while it was occupied by Russian military forces."
1906_B,t3_1scbek,RANDOM_ASIAN_GIRL,"Inspired by [this comic](http://www.akimbocomics.com/comic/2010-10-04-Eat_Shit_And_Die_164.jpg), which is exactly the **wrong** way to deal with depression, I'd like to posit a few statements about depression and ideally you can educate me and change my view.

**1. Depression is self-inflicted**

People who suffer from depression are usually not billionaires, bon vivants and socially esteemed high achievers, but those who made bad decisions in the past. They maybe didn't follow through with their education, they maybe didn't find out what motivates them in life, they maybe abused drugs and/or alcohol, they maybe put all their effort in getting meaningless sex. Now they're an empty shell and don't know why.

You might point me to some celebrity exceptions, those who seem to have it all, but still suffer depression to the point where they even commit suicide. But do they really have it all? Some abuse drugs, some can't form a personal relationship, some become arrogant assholes.

You can change my view on this by giving me statistics that prove that sober, highly connected, social, educated people are at the same risk to become depressed as drug/alcohol abusing, shut-in, antisocial, uneducated people.

**2. Depressed people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps**

Following contention 1, depressed people can find out why they are depressed and do something about it. They can find their passion in life, they can become healthier, more educated, gain social skills, etc. If you're depressed because you don't have a significant other, work towards that goal. If you loathe your minimum-wage job, get higher education or start your own business. If you are disgusted by your appearance, work out and eat healthily.

The comic at the start simply addresses depression as if the people around the protagonist don't acknowledge or understand it. In my opinion, when someone tells you that they're depressed, you shouldn't tell them to snap out of it, but rather ask: ""What are you doing about it?""

Change my view."
1906_B,t1_cdw35c5_1,jsmooth7,"I would suggest you read these two posts, that describes Allie Brosh's experiences with depression.
- http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.ca/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html
- http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.ca/2013/05/depression-part-two.html
I think the problem here is you are assuming people are depressed for a reason, but that is frequently not the case. Sometimes people just become depressed for absolutely no reason.
For example you said you can ""follow your passion."" What if one day you found you just felt nothing, even when doing something you used to enjoy? What would you do then?"
1906_B,t1_cdw583y_1,RANDOM_ASIAN_GIRL,"Thanks for the links, I have read them already.
&gt;What if one day you found you just felt nothing, even when doing something you used to enjoy?
That's just the nature of human beings. If you eat your favorite meal every day, you'll get bored of it after a while. There is no solution that fits everyone, but proactively trying to find something else to enjoy, preferably many things, seems like a good idea."
1906_B,t1_cdw5hxm_1,jsmooth7,"Okay, but what if you find *nothing* makes you feel emotion, no matter what you tried?
I'm going to use the dead fish analogy from Depression Part 2 because it's a good one. If I'm depressed and I tell you ""My fish are all dead,"" you are telling me ""Go find your fish."" It's not helpful."
1906_B,t1_cdw5hxm_2,jsmooth7,Your suggestion makes sense to you because you can rely on your emotions to act the way we would expect them to. ie Have the same meal again - Feel bored. Try something new - Feel joy. Depression affects these emotions and there isn't always a reason for it.
1906_B,t1_cdw5nt2_1,RANDOM_ASIAN_GIRL,"Great elaboration, I still have problems getting into the mind of a depressed person, though. If my fish die or the love of my life leaves me, I will be sad and mourn for a while (these things happened to me, another pet though). Maybe days, weeks, months or even years. In the meantime, however, life goes on. I might think about my dead pet, the great time we had together and weep myself to sleep. But I still enjoy my breakfast, meeting with my friends, learning new things, etc."
1906_B,t1_cdw5nt2_2,RANDOM_ASIAN_GIRL,How is it different for someone who is depressed?
1906_B,t1_cdw63fd_1,jsmooth7,"Feeling depressed is not the same thing as just feeling sad. For example, if your love of your life leaves you, you'll feel sad and appropriately so. But you're still capable of feeling other emotions like enjoying learning something interesting or laughing with friends, and those feelings will come back over time."
1906_B,t1_cdw63fd_2,jsmooth7,"If you are depressed your emotions don't necessarily make sense in this way. There are many ways this could be. You might just feel sad all the time no matter what, regardless of what you normally would feel. Or you might just not feel anything at all.
It's a subtle difference and that's why I think a lot of people don't realize they are depressed right away."
1906_B,t1_cdw6e4r,RANDOM_ASIAN_GIRL,"∆

That makes more sense to me. I still have no idea how it would feel to be depressed, as I was always a positive, do-it-yourself kind of person. But I might get my head around it that others can't control or influence their emotions that well."
2487_B,t3_1hf3eh,ManShapedReplicator,"Due to the large overlap in population and revolving door between wealthy corporate interests and government institutions (including elected officials, unelected bureaucrats, etc), I believe that corporatism and state control cause the same degree of negative effects and are equally dangerous to the vast majority of people who are not part of the wealthy elite.

In the United States, we are presented with a false dichotomy between right-wing ""corporatists"" and left-wing ""statists"", when both sides represent entrenched, powerful interests. The interests of both sides (corporations and government entities) are similarly at odds with those of the majority of the population, and in many cases the corporate interests and statist interests are literally the same people with the same agendas.

It is often argued that the role of democracy is to ensure that government works toward the common good, but this ignores an important fact: everyone has one vote, but some people have one vote and billions of dollars with which to influence government. Government will inevitably serve the interests of those who have one vote and billions of dollars over those who just have one vote.

The American right argues that state intervention in the economy and society as a whole is often immoral, unfair, and damaging -- I think this is correct. The American left argues that corporations have the same negative effects, and I think this is correct as well.

I think that the primary cause of this problem is the incestuous relationship between corporations and government (""K Street""), but I also think that further regulations on government behavior to limit this kind of corruption would be necessarily ineffective, due to the intrinsic connection between wealth and political power.

I am most familiar with American politics, so those are the examples I have used here, but I don't think this problem is uniquely American. I would like to be convinced that there is a way that we can limit this destructive tendency, but I cannot envision a way that this can be done (at least not without having hugely destructive effects on the rest of society). At the minimum, it would be helpful if I had a reason to believe that one threat or the other was greater, so that I could choose a ""side"" to try to make things better. Please CMV."
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_1,FaustTheBird,"You've got a strange way of phrasing this post. It sounds like what you're really saying is that concentrated power in the hands of the few is dangerous. In most democratic countries, I would think this is the normative position to hold with respect to the topic. We could try to C your V on this, but I don't think that's what you're asking. We're taking this claim (Concentrated power in the hands of the few is dangerous) as axiomatically true and starting from there."
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_2,FaustTheBird,"So then you're saying that corporations and governments are equally dangerous because they both represent forms of our axiomatic foundation (above). So what can be done to change your view?
1) We could attempt to show that either Corporate-person-hood or Government are not concentrations of power in the hands of the few."
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_3,FaustTheBird,2) We could attempt to show that there are more people in one class or the other and therefore power is more distributed in one form versus the other. This would appear to give us a metric that allows us to demonstrably say one meets the criteria more than the other.
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_4,FaustTheBird,"3) We could attempt to show that the power being concentrated is more or less dangerous for one class or the other. In this formulation, we'll try to address the various powers of each class and then attempt to rank them by risk value.
4) We could also try to reformulate your position for you and state that you are attempting to figure out a better system than either of those currently discussed, at which point we can try to point to changes we can make (like anarchy, communism, varying degrees of regulation, etc). I think this spirals into debate and wouldn't be helpful."
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_5,FaustTheBird,"So let's talk about (1).
The U.S. Representative Democracy allows every citizen of voting age to cast one vote per elected seat. That's a pretty wide distribution of power. Corporations on the other hand allow anyone with money, regardless of citizenship status, felony status, or age to participate in the results of the corporation (goods and services) at any time, as many times as they want, with as much volume as they want, limited by their available funds. Additionally, public corporations allow anyone from anywhere to obtain voting rights with regard to the direction of any corporation in proportion to the amount of money they have relative to others participating. Both of these systems are representative and not direct, so ultimately both systems place true decision making power in the hands of the few, even if there are mechanisms for distributing that power to the many (voting, cashflow, etc). So it looks like (1) stands as is and we must try something else."
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_6,FaustTheBird,"(2)
Clearly, there are more purchasers of corporate goods than voters for any single government. A corporation can sell to all 50 states but a state government only has voters from that state. The US Federal government excludes anyone under 18, many felons, and non-citizens. By contrast, travelers, teenagers, non-citizen immigrants, and even people half-a-world away can participate in corporations either through purchasing power or through owning shares. So it would seem that in this sense, corporations give power to a wider group of individuals than governments. But is that a good thing? What if the actions of a corporation are negative for only one segment of the population but beneficial to the rest? Major tyranny of the majority! The US system is designed to divide people into polities by geography partly because it gives those people more autonomy than being awash in a mass-majority-rules situation. If there were no state, county, or town governments, 300 millions Americans would vote exactly where to put our uranium waste and wherever it went, those people would just have to deal. So here's an interesting paradox: spreading the power out to more people results in those people being disempowered relative to a smaller government with less participants deciding their actions for themselves. Hmmm. Add on the fact that economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few already, and we start to see that one vote per person matters a lot when calculating the level of power concentration and its impact on decision making."
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_7,FaustTheBird,"I won't go on because I don't have the time. Perhaps someone else can pick up the last 2 points. But I would like to make this point. Governments are ultimately systems for groups of people to make collective decisions regarding issues that effect them. These issues are not only economic in nature and they are not measured in dollars. There is a lot of value in reducing the number of important decisions you have to make daily and we have found that representative democracy to be better than direct democracy because of that. We must always work together to govern ourselves better and often that means less regulation not more, and sometimes it means more regulation not less. I propose that only representative democratic government can provide the necessary distribution of power and control to the governed. It is possible that the current US system is failing to facilitate this distribution, it may be the case the the US system is poorly constructed from the foundation and inevitably leads to concentration of power away from the governed. But I do not think corporations can provide the same level of power distribution, not without collective decisions by a governing body mandating such a structure (which would ultimately be some form of collective ownership like communism). Therefore, I think that the dangers of corporations will vary on the circumstance throughout the ages but that the mechanisms for control will not trend towards distributed decision making in the best interests of the governed. In contrast, the dangers of governments will not vary much over the ages (violence, economic redistribution, oppression, suppression, etc) but that the mechanisms for control and distribution of power to the governed will continually evolve (at the behest of the governed) and we will design governments to our liking because governments truly live and die by the actions of the governed (and the violence of other governments, but that's another story)."
2487_B,t1_catuwc7_8,FaustTheBird,**tl;dr: Governments will always wield more dangerous powers but always provide the mechanisms for wider and wider distribution of those powers to the many. Corporations will always wield less dangerous power (though sometimes only slightly less dangerous) and will always minimize distributed decision making as it is antithetical to the goal of maximal efficiency.**
2487_B,t1_catvz3m_1,ManShapedReplicator,"I like the way you are approaching the question. My primary concern is that representative democracy as seen in the United States doesn't actually distribute power very widely, since the representatives that we elect (especially at the federal level) are 1) overwhelmingly from a wealthy class of influential elites, 2) chosen from a restricted set of candidates vetted by two massive political parties, 3) often heavily involved in the very industries they are trusted to oversee. The decisions that these elected officials make are then biased in many ways toward their own interests and not those of voters, so the ostensibly ""distributed"" nature of democratic power is really not so distributed."
2487_B,t1_catvz3m_2,ManShapedReplicator,"If representative democracy operated in practice as it does in theory, with our representatives being a representative sampling of the population (a healthy mix of other groups from different classes and political outlooks), then I would have less concern. The way it is now though, our federal representatives are overwhelmingly wealthy, from wealthy political family dynasties, and have close ties to large corporate interests. Our laws and government policies frequently reflect this bias of our ruling class."
2487_B,t1_catvz3m_3,ManShapedReplicator,"My point is that governments are in fact much more like corporations, because the people running the government usually get there by virtue of being wealthy and well-connected, not just by being good representatives (in fact they normally cannot advertise enough to get elected *unless* they are wealthy or have the support of wealthy interests). The huge advantage that incumbents have in elections is also relevant, as it demonstrates that government officials do not always have to act in the interest of their constituents in order to remain in power."
2487_B,t1_catvz3m_4,ManShapedReplicator,"If we let corporations go unchecked, they will act to maximize their profit with little regard for the well-being of others. If we let government go unchecked, government officials will go about accumulating power over the lives of everyone and use that power to improve their own position.
Most people seem to believe that we should either trust government to restrain corporations, or that we can trust market mechanisms guide corporations towards good decisions without a lot of regulation. I think that both of these views are incorrect, which is why I want to have my view changed."
2487_B,t1_catx19r_1,FaustTheBird,"Should you trust the current U.S. Federal Government? By most sets of criteria for trust: no.
Should we constrain corporations? Yes. Corporations are just groups of people and we constrain people for the common good. It stands to reason that if we do not believe anarchy to be the best course of action today, then regulation of corporations is part and parcel of government responsibility."
2487_B,t1_catx19r_2,FaustTheBird,"Will unrestraining corporation result in less risk? No, the act of unrestraining corporations is an exercise in reduction of risk from government. It says nothing about the risk of corporations.
Should we reform constraints on corporations? Yes, as it seems apparent that the system is currently doing a lot of harm. That could mean less regulation in some ways, more in other ways, but reform is probably necessary."
2487_B,t1_catx19r_3,FaustTheBird,"Are you trying to decide between governments in general and corporations in general? Or is it perhaps that you're trying to decide between this particular government and corporations in general? That's an unfair and lopsided comparison. The problem with that distinction is that it's entirely narrowly focused on exactly what action you should take to effect the shortest possible term of positive change without any respect for the actual effect you're facilitating. Democratic governments are extensions of the power of the citizen. As you note, they often need reform, much like any other system could need reform. But any action you take with regard to regulating or deregulating corporations is inherently a decision to use the government to effect change in your world. That means you implicitly trust government to take actions on your behalf based on what you believe. Whether or not you deregulate corporations is a decision you have to make based on the impact you wish to have on your world, not based on which team's shirt you wear."
2487_B,t1_catx19r_4,FaustTheBird,"Are you trying to decide whether or not regulation is, in and of itself, a dangerous thing because it entails the empowering of government? That's a totally different and much narrower question and it's certainly not a dichotomy of which side is more dangerous. It's more a question of, for all possible collective goals, what is the least dangerous way to achieve each of those goals individually? Regulation? Market dynamics? Education?"
2487_B,t1_catx19r_5,FaustTheBird,"So try to break out of this ""us vs them"" rhetorical bullshit. You don't have two choices, and choosing ""corporations"" or ""government"" isn't an actual choice anyway, it's just a jersey. Real choices are things like deciding that the cost of measuring the distance a letter has to travel is greater than the lost revenue from having a flat carriage value and that moving to a flat carriage value frees up members of society for more productive work while simultaneously increasing the predictability of mail delivery, therefore increasing quality of life for everyone. Real choices are things like deciding that since it is impossible for any citizens to sue aluminum factories for community deaths due to the inability to determine which adjacent factories are responsible for pumping toxic fluorine gas into the local atmosphere resulting in mass deaths (aside from the fact that since nearly everyone died, it would be very difficult for any of them to actually bring the suit), that therefore as a community all existing and future aluminum factories must abide by specific rules and regulations. These are choices. Corp v State is not."
2487_B,t1_catyovb_1,ManShapedReplicator,"I totally agree with you, and did not ever try to give the impression that I was framing the question as ""us vs them"".
This is the problem: According to my current assessment, it is equally dangerous for the well-being of most people to either 1) empower the government to regulate and control businesses, because such empowerment will give more power to the same people we are trying to regulate, and means more coercive intrusion in people's lives; or 2) dis-empower the government, thereby empowering businesses that often do not act morally, so they are more able to do things like ""pumping toxic flourine gas into the local atmosphere"", as you said."
2487_B,t1_catyovb_2,ManShapedReplicator,"If the nature of businesses and governments -- and the interconnection between the two -- makes it equally dangerous to take either of these actions, there is no rational way to choose whether regulation or deregulation is preferable, in general or in specific situations. This is not a tenable position, or at least it fails to provide any way of creating a positive outcome, hence I would like to have my view changed."
2487_B,t1_catyovb_3,ManShapedReplicator,"The reason I phrased this in a more general sense instead of just about regulation was that I think the conundrum presented by regulation is also applicable to social services and many other areas of government involvement.
An example of how this works regarding social services:
If the government builds a huge apparatus of wealth redistribution and wage controls in the name of economic equality, it will help some poor people but it will also create the potential for massive inefficiency, waste, and corruption. Such a system would also necessitate more government coercion in everyone's lives (which I think is a bad thing). If it does not build such a system, we are empowering businesses/corporations and private interests by not taxing them and by leaving it up to them to set wages and create a fair distribution of wealth (which I don't think they would do)."
2487_B,t1_cau0x1e_1,FaustTheBird,"Well, I guess my question is still, why would you think the answer is either BLACK or WHITE? The answer to each of your concerns is nuanced and requires detailed thought, tracing out logical implications, game theory, metrics, alternative scenarios, testable hypotheses, and on and on and on. It requires a definition of ""better"" that can be tested against. I agree with you that government intervention in the lives of every citizen is a bad thing. Does that mean public transportation is a bad thing? Depends on the letter of the laws written, there's no blanket answer you can use."
2487_B,t1_cau0x1e_2,FaustTheBird,"I appreciate that you've identified that you are in an untenable position and that this is your motivation for having your view changed. I don't think you will get your view changed effectively in favor of the idea that one form of power concentration is less dangerous than another. However, what I would like to is change your view that there is no way of creating a positive outcome."
2487_B,t1_cau0x1e_3,FaustTheBird,"With corporations, if you have a problem with one of them, try boycotting them. See how it works. Alternatively, try buying things from their competitors or even buying stock and participating in their shareholders votes and try to fix the problem you see.
With governments, look to what problems you see in the government and then try to figure out how you can participate in changing it. You can find a politician and harass them. You can campaign for a politician you believe in. You can address the problem in society with a market solution or volunteer work or non-profit activity. You can even run for office yourself. You can participate in local political organizations, you can participate in your local government to apply pressure upwards through your county or state and you can participate in your state government to apply pressure upwards to the federal government."
2487_B,t1_cau0x1e_4,FaustTheBird,"If you really think you have no options with government, you can still try to be a revolutionary and reform government through a complete and total state or national no-confidence movement.
Maybe you personally can't stop the war in Syria or the personal income tax or the war on drugs with a simple vote or by boycotting the government, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to participate towards positive change."
2487_B,t1_cau57bq_1,ManShapedReplicator,"&gt; Well, I guess my question is still, why would you think the answer is either BLACK or WHITE?
What in my comments leads you to think that I view the issue as being black or white?"
2487_B,t1_cau57bq_2,ManShapedReplicator,"&gt; I don't think you will get your view changed effectively in favor of the idea that one form of power concentration is less dangerous than another. However, what I would like to is change your view that there is no way of creating a positive outcome.
Fair enough."
2487_B,t1_cau57bq_3,ManShapedReplicator,"&gt; With corporations, if you have a problem with one of them, try boycotting them. See how it works. Alternatively, try buying things from their competitors or even buying stock and participating in their shareholders votes and try to fix the problem you see.
Boycotts are sometimes effective, but boycotting a company because (for example) its CEO was previously the head of the government regulatory agency that oversaw it is not something that would gain enough support to be effective. Most people just don't care, and there are few specific examples that are egregious enough to really motivate anyone. The problem is that the sum of all these practices (as opposed to one or two specific instances of it) is harmful. I generally don't think that boycotts are an appropriate way to deal with the systemic issue of the incestuous relationship between corporations and the government."
2487_B,t1_cau57bq_4,ManShapedReplicator,"&gt;With governments, look to what problems you see in the government and then try to figure out how you can participate in changing it.

You can even run for office yourself. You can participate in local political organizations, you can participate in your local government to apply pressure upwards through your county or state and you can participate in your state government to apply pressure upwards to the federal government.
I do participate in local political organizations and volunteer, although I'm not really cut out for politics so I doubt I will ever run for office. I think that some of these suggestions are helpful on a small scale, but they hardly make a dent in the large systemic problems. Even supporting a politician is unlikely to change things, because the only politicians who are taken seriously by the media and government institutions in the US are those who are pre-approved by one of the two major parties. Just look at how Ron Paul and Ralph Nader (the first mostly-independent politicians who come to mind) are looked at as completely hopeless."
2487_B,t1_cau57bq_5,ManShapedReplicator,"&gt;If you really think you have no options with government, you can still try to be a revolutionary and reform government through a complete and total state or national no-confidence movement.
This may be the best option for bringing about real change, though it is of course also the most dangerous, risky, and unlikely to succeed. Unlike some of the younger and more idealistic redditors here, I do not take the idea of throwing society into complete revolutionary chaos lightly, as I recognize that it would cause immense suffering and we could end up worse off than we started."
2487_B,t1_cau57bq_6,ManShapedReplicator,"You make a good point that things *can* be changed for the better, although I'm still somewhat unsure of what the best way is to do this. You have changed my view in that I realize I should not be looking for a simple blanket answer that will apply to all (or even most) cases, since finding the right answer for any given case is so complex and unpredictable. ∆"
2599_A,t3_1fj2qs,thename226,"I've had my view since I learned about evolution. Now I'm question its validity.

It started with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1fiqba/2_year_old_problems_cinnamon_rolls_arent_instant/caapf9x?context=3), I think started a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1fiy64/question_how_do_you_feel_knowing_that_you_wont_be/) on /r/childfree but no one came up with a reason good enough to change my view, then again, I don't think they were trying so it's up to you guys.

I just find it very hard to believe that someone doesn't want to pass on their genes, I mean, it's what all our ancestors have lived for, it's what all animals live for, heck, some spiders let the female eat them just so they have better chances of passing on their genes.

It's the sole purpose of our existence (in addition to any other purposes we have for ourselves). It bothers me to no end that many generations ago passing on our genes was important but now that we're more intelligent we're CHOOSING to not pass on our genes."
2599_A,t1_caas3s0,MrMoby,"Animals don't have sex because they want to pass on their genes - they have sex because they want orgasms and the satisfaction of their instincts.  Evolution has created these rewards as a mechanism to compel animals to reproduce in order to create a reason to pass on their genes.  When I say animals, I can even include humans in that.  After all, many people are ""accidents"" - children born only because their parents wanted to have sex, not because they felt a need to pass on their genes.  Also, many children are born because their parents had an instinctual desire to have a child.  These children were not born because their parents wanted to ensure that their genes were passed on, but because of inbuilt instinct developed by natural selection."
3014_B,t3_31qw5t,emk2203,"Modern society is comparable to an all-you-can-eat buffet. You being born in a first-world country is comparable to you gaining access to this buffet because someone lends you the entrance fee. If you refuse to pay taxes, it means that you don't want to pay this entrance fee back. 

""But I am not even eating right now!"". Doesn't matter, you can if you want to. I don't think you are going to refuse emergency services, firemen, or FEMA aid if you are about to need their services. Government is acting as an agent of society to make you pay back what was given to you. You have to acknowledge this debt.

Agreement to anything doesn't play a role. You didn't agree to getting born, nor to dying later on either. Or getting sick, or in an accident.

Your parents decided to sign you up for this buffet. They could have emigrated to Somalia or any other failed state, and you would now enjoy a tax-free life. Or, to stay within the example, to not opt for the buffet. 

Instead, they chose to pay the entrance fee with a loan in your name. Remember, it's your debt. It's incurred for the potential options, not for the actual eating. You are already in the room, any action whatsoever won't change that. You can refuse to contribute, simply by not earning anything. This doesn't change that you have a debt which you still are responsible for paying. If you don't, you are dodging your debt and your responsibility.

If you make a million $ and pay $330,000 of taxes, it's not that someone took your hard-earned money away. Compare with a no-tax situation in a failed state, where you live in a hut in the wilderness. Without all the support you have now and take for granted, you would be able to make maybe $10 / day as the smartest guy, when all others around make $1 / day. 

Not unrealistic for failed states where you don't have to pay taxes. Remember, clay huts with a well. You were able to make an additional $999,700 *only* because you are in the US and not in Somalia. Society is your dormant partner in this business venture and supplied the infrastructure, for this they demand $1 for every $3 you make. Sounds fair, and you need to recognize this partnership.

It's an investment in you from your dormant partner, society, which made all you can achieve possible. Taxes are the payout to your dormant partner, and government acts as a proxy to collect this debt. The debt originates from society. It builds with the generations.

This is way it's justified to tax, and why I feel good doing so. This enables our successors to do the same.

EDIT: A special welcome to all the brigadeers from /r/shitstatistssay/omments/31srt9/society_is_the_silent_partner_that_makes/ . Aren't you tired of the same old arguments? I swear, I heard the thing with the bum and the windshield now the third time. Didn't get any more relevant. Same for all your other BS.

3014_B,t1_cq48c47,skatastic57,"Ignoring the analogies, what you're describing could apply to those living in North Korea.  Sure they're a failed state by any Western (or any) standards but from the perspective of those in the country, would you say they have a moral obligation to pay the Kims?  Without the Kims, you could say, they wouldn't have their glorious hut with a thatch roof."
3014_B,t1_cq4c165_1,emk2203,"The less you benefit from society, the smaller your obligation. If someone in North Korea does not benefit from society, he doesn't have a moral obligation. Maybe they have firefighters, for which there would be some obligation. But very little.
I would even argue that they could probably do better if left alone, so North Korea and the Kims owe *them*."
3014_B,t1_cq4czst,skatastic57,Well how do you define a person's benefit from society?
3014_B,t1_cq4dd2q,emk2203,"I imagine myself being all alone. Hut with well. I have no knowledge, no books, nothing. What I gain from this situation is mine. The difference to a modern society, where I can do infinitely more, is my benefit.

I wrote some numbers in the original post."
3014_B,t1_cq4elol_1,skatastic57,"You don't really define a methodology for determining a person's benefit from society, you just threw out some made up numbers and said that is fair.
I don't want services from the NSA, DEA, CIA, or most of the US's military around the world.  I feel rather morally wronged that the government forces me to pay for them to do things I find repugnant.  I'm not in the least bit made better when the military drops a missile out of a drone on a village half way around the globe.  I'm not better off when the DEA shuts down a marijuana dispensary.  I'm not better off when I want to start a business but the government regulations and hurdles makes it too arduous and costly to meet the requirements and actually get started."
3014_B,t1_cq4elol_2,skatastic57,"When the police that I do want to pay for turn into the police that kill innocent people I'm not better off.
I understand your point is that there are things like roads, civil courts, contract enforcement, education, and others that people need a government to provide in order to be successful and that people should be happy to pay for those things.  My point is that many governments go too far and do too much and that I should't feel that it's my moral duty to pay for those things.  Of course the government has guns and jails to put me in if I don't pay so I do but I certainly don't think it's my moral imperative to pay."

It's a bit difficult to write a thesis in a CMV post, so the approximation should give a hint at why I want to show.

3220_B,t3_2xi4wd,noussea,"My family and friends are complaining a lot because I don't call or visit them or meet them on a regular basis which is what you'd expect from a close friend or a son.

My parents live in another city 500 miles away. My brother is at least an hour drive away. My other brother is in another city as well; sometimes visiting our city. Most of my friends live at least an hour drive away from myself as well. Although I don't think it would be so much different if they were a lot closer. What I'd like to say here is in order to meet the demands of closeness I'd need to sacrifice so much of my time.

I spend most of my time working. When I'm not working I'm with my girlfriend most of the time. I spend the rest at home alone by myself; reading, watching TV series, educational YouTube channels, or TED in my spare time when I'm not with my girlfriend. I also work at home on my side projects that I'd like to pursue. I believe these are making me strong, pushing me towards, making me a better person day by day and I feel good about living the way I do.

According to my priorities; I want to have a strong and healthy relationship with the love of my life whom I want to spend rest of my life with and I should accomplish things that I'd like to in my personal life.

Therefore I spend my time accordingly. Leaving too little to the rest. I understand when other people do that. I don't bug them about it. I believe people should respect that and shouldn't take it personally and weaken the relationship. 

This definitely doesn't mean that I don't love my brothers. This doesn't mean I don't like to spend time with my friends. This just means our lives are separate from each other. However our relationship is still strong even though we might be apart.

Note that I feel that there is something wrong with my belief here. I don't know what and I'm happy to learn if there is. If there is anything that I can change about my behavior on this matter it starts with believing in it first. So there you go; change my view."
3220_B,t1_cp0t5wj_1,divinesleeper,"You can expect all you like. Relationships and fondness of people is beyond conscious control. A relationship will detoriate if you stop investing in it, that's just human nature. Do you think people *choose* to grow apart? Of course not!
As others have pointed out, this supposed core of relationships you speak of is nothing but shared experiences. As shared experiences fade to memory and are placed alongside new ones, the core of your previous relationships weakens. That doesn't mean it just goes away like that, but it will weaken if you let it."
3220_B,t1_cp0yvbv_1,noussea,"∆ for making me understand that it's not how it should be in theory. It's how people feel and behave naturally.
I do now agree to the fact that it deteriorates when you don't keep it nurtured, and it's normal. I believe it was /u/wdn to point out that when there is a consistency to sharing and bonding periodically people will have a common ground or at least should have. Then depending on the frequency it might deteriorate to the sweet spot which would be the balance between how close you'd like to be, how much effort you'd like to put in (Hey Putin!), how close they'd like to be, how much effort they'd like to put in etc."

3588_B,t3_3gi0it,jetpacksforall,"Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against  candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. 

* ""So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.""  

* ""Hillary says she has a plan for restarting the Israel-Palestine peace process, but so far nobody has been able to nail her down on the details."" 

* Recently right here on one of the CMV posts about Bernie Sanders, /u/bayernownz1995 says that ""Sanders *does* have a solid page on racial injustice on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.""

You hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. 

But the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. 

Secondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?"" 

If you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a ""liar,"" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.

So that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? 

**EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it? I got a lot of deltas burning a hole in my pocket here....**

Can you imagine if I walked into the bank today to get a loan for a new business venture and I didn't give any details on how I planned on getting the business to work, what I would do if certain aspects failed, how I planned on paying that money back to the people (the equivalent of the government putting money back into social services)? I'd be laughed out of the bank."
3588_B,t1_ctz9hb6_2,Ralkir,"If professional financial institutions don't give out money without a clear plan and direction, why should the people under a government expect any less?"
3588_B,t1_ctzajqx,jetpacksforall,I'm talking about politicians making policy proposals during a campaign. I'm not saying government should be run in secret *after* candidates win an election. 
3588_B,t1_ctzapa6_1,Ralkir,"That's exactly my point though. Policy proposals during the campaign is exactly like me going to the bank and trying to get a loan. The people are the bank, and the candidates are trying to get a loan for their policies. Why should I invest in a candidate if I don't know how they are going to make their plan work?"
3588_B,t1_ctzapa6_2,Ralkir,"The bank doesn't give you the money, then ask for progress reports after you've started your business venture, they want to know they're not wasting their money BEFORE hand."
3588_B,t1_ctzb07y_1,jetpacksforall,"I see your point. Unfortunately, for reasons I detailed in the CMV, you'll NEVER see a candidate elected to office who details their plans to the degree that a bank would require for a loan. Candidates who offer too much detail get eaten alive in the press, and those who spout happy talk get elected."
3588_B,t1_ctzb07y_2,jetpacksforall,Unless you can convince me otherwise or offer examples to the contrary.
3588_B,t1_ctzbma9_1,Ralkir,"While I will concede that if a politician wants to get elected it is probably not in their best interest to spell out their plan in detail. I don't think that's entirely what your CMV is about. After all your initial title
&gt;Political candidates who refuse to detail their policies are making the right choice.
The right choice in regards to what? I have demonstrated that they are not making the financially right choice. They are not making the right choice to allow voters to properly decide how best to spend their money."
3588_B,t1_ctzbma9_2,Ralkir,"Further at the end you state:
&gt;Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail?
Which I have provided, as laying out a financial plan gives voters the ability to properly decide how to spend their money, just like a bank."
3588_B,t1_ctzbma9_3,Ralkir,"Further one of your major concerns seems to be having a detailed plan would be difficult to carry out because other politicians may not back the plan for various reasons. That may be the case in certain governments, but, for in example Canada, their is tight party control so if a party gets a majority government, they can basically do whatever they want. A detailed plan would be feasible as other parties couldn't do anything to stop a bill from being past and any descent within the party is not tolerated."
3588_B,t1_ctzbma9_4,Ralkir,"In conclusion it seems your view has been transformed at the very least. You have been shown good reasons as to why a detailed plan should be the route. Your CMV included terms such as the ""right choice"". I ask you, is the ""right"" thing to do everything in your power to get elected, or is it do the responsible right thing for the voters so they can make the most informed decision?"
3588_B,t1_ctzbma9_5,Ralkir,"What is more ""right""?"
3588_B,t1_ctzgew9_1,jetpacksforall,"It's the ""right"" choice because politicians who share too many details don't get elected in the first place, and if they do, their promises will come back to haunt them as others in the government seek to take advantage and use them as leverage to negotiate terms that can severely hamper his or her effectiveness in office. It doesn't matter how morally correct a candidate may be if they don't get elected in the first place."
3588_B,t1_ctzgew9_2,jetpacksforall,"That said I'm going to give you a delta for bringing up the Canadian system. You are absolutely right that in a more parliamentary system it is possible for candidates to caucus together into parties or coalitions, those coalitions can have specific platforms that all candidates sign onto, and it is possible to reveal a great deal more detail. So yes, in a very different electoral system than the one used in the US, it is possible for candidates to provide much greater detail in their proposals (provided other candidates on the same slate have also signed onto those details). ∆"
3737_A,t3_3epjfs,markvadeika,"I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been boring to me, and it seems that when compared to other sports, golf takes the least skill. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying professional golfers aren't extremely talented, golf is not easy, but compared to anything else, it's nothing. In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.

**Edit:** People have pointed out that there are sports that take less skill, like Frisbee and swimming. I guess I was thinking of the slightly more mainstream sports. But my point still stands, aside from that."

Much less hitting it with any sort of accuracy.  Much less the different types of shots you need to be able to do well.  And often times with your feet well below or above the object you're trying to hit."

Making examples of people like this is the only deterrent I can think of for /b/tards who think terrorizing people, risking lives, and draining public resources for no reason is harmless and hilarious.

It's hard for me to feel much sympathy when their /b/tard lives are permanently ruined, since they're practically never held accountable.

You're saying he should face decades of imprisonment for what he's done... now think about that, really. We throw around punishment very severely in our society, but really think about what you're saying. If you lock him up for 20 years, he'll get out when he's 37; for 30 and he'll be 47; for 40 and he'll be 57 years old. We're talking about a child's life here. Granted, what he did is undoubtedly wrong, and I cannot imagine being a victim, having a SWAT team in full gear and weaponry busting down your family's door has to be one of the scariest experiences I can think of. That said, this is still a 17 year old child. A moron really, if only by age. Can you imagine the person you were 10 years ago, and how different you were? Or the person you were in high school? This is just some idiot kid who thought he was pranking people. Put him away for 5 years, that's still a massive amount of time, but when he gets out you'll more than likely have someone who is truly sorry. If you don't let him out until he's in his 30's or 40's, you have effectively destroyed his entire life. He'll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he's already got this criminal record, he'll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult... Sometimes I think we lock some people away for far too long and don't actually think about what it would have to be like sitting in a room for so many hundreds or thousands of days. "

d4tmvhh,d4tmvhh_1,Leumashy,"Here is how I am interpreting your view to be, please correct me if I'm wrong.
You agree that *some* level of taxes are required as you enjoy the benefits of a taxed society such as: roads, bridges, police, fire fighters, etc. However, you hate progressive income tax because you believe that you, and the people around you, are paying more than your fair share of taxes. You would prefer a flat tax because you believe that under a flat tax system, you would pay less in taxes for the current same benefits."
d4tmvhh,d4tmvhh_2,Leumashy,"Here is my argument to change your view. Under a flat tax system, you would be paying MORE in taxes. The more income you make, the higher tax percentage you pay. Thus, if a flat tax were implemented, the upper 50% of all tax income payers would pay less, while the bottom 50% of all tax income payers would have to pay more."
d4tmvhh,d4tmvhh_3,Leumashy,"If you fall within the bottom 50%, under a flat tax, you would pay more taxes. If you fall within the upper 50%, you would pay less taxes.
I guarantee that you, and the coworkers around you, are part of the bottom 50%. Thus under a flat tax, you would pay more in taxes."
d4tmvhh,d4tmvhh_4,Leumashy,"Remember, there is a distinction between top 50% of income earners and top 50% of income tax generators. To be part of the top 50% of income tax generators requires FAR more than a minimum wage job. Something like the top 20% of income earners pay for over 80% of all generated income tax. Unless you fall into the top 15%ish of income earners, you will pay more in a flat tax. I guarantee that minimum wage workers do not fall into the top 15% of income earners."
d4tmvhh,d4tmvhh_5,Leumashy,"I have purposefully not included any conversation on governmental services that you may or may not agree with, such as social security, medicare, and any governmental spending. This is because if these services were eliminated, you would have a new, lower tax rate even under a progressive income tax. And thus, would still pay more in a flat tax system. Also, I feel that wasteful governmental spending is a separate CMV."
d4tmvhh,d4txoxi_1,M1n1f1g,"&gt; Thus, if a flat tax were implemented, the upper 50% of all tax income payers would pay less, while the bottom 50% of all tax income payers would have to pay more.
This seems to confuse mean with median. Imagine the following society. There are 3 tax payers, A, B, and C, each earning 1 and being taxed at 1/3 of their income (that is, 1/3). There is also D, who earns 2 and is taxed at 1/2 of their income (that is, 1). The total tax revenue is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1, which is 2. To achieve the same taxation with a flat tax rate, that rate would be 2/5. So we see that the *majority* of the population pays more taxes (2/5 &gt; 1/3). Also note that this is a somewhat realistic society, with many low-earners and fewer high-earners."
d4tmvhh,d4us606_1,Leumashy,"The concept that I'm talking about is understandably confusing. The 50% of which I'm talking about, is this:
The TOTAL tax collected is 100%. Where does this 100% come from? All tax payers. You can divvy up tax payers into 2 parts, the bottom 50% and the upper 50%. The way it's divided is starting from one end of the spectrum (say from highest income earner going down), add the amount of taxes the person pays until the amount equals 50%. This calculation has *nothing* to do with mean and median of income/income tax."
d4tmvhh,d4us606_2,Leumashy,"What your example is saying is exactly what I was saying. A flat tax would increase taxes for the majority of the population. This is because the upper 50% of income tax payers is only around something like 15%ish of the total population. So with a flat tax, 15% of the population would get a lower tax rate while 85% of people would have to pay more in taxes."

d50ttep,d50ttep_1,Insomniadict,"The only thing that matters when it comes to empowerment is whether or not the person in question enjoys what they are doing.
I would not use payment as a marker of whether or not something is empowering. In the specific examples of paid modeling, it is very often not empowering because they are doing what other people want them to do. Just because you get paid for something doesn't mean that you necessarily feel empowered by what you are doing."
d50ttep,d50ttep_2,Insomniadict,"When self-posting, they are doing it for their own enjoyment, meaningless internet points, and compliments. Does it make them feel good? Then it's empowering.
Also, why does this only apply to women?"
d50ttep,d50usrh,barkleycharles420,"I'm not talking about ""feeling"" empowered, I'm talking about BEING empowered. What makes someone powerful? Money and fame/influence. Not all of them are getting money and not all of them are actual models with fame/influence. And yes, getting paid is very empowering. It gives people the freedom to go anywhere, do anything. And I never said it only applies to women. In my comments, I've used ""women"" and ""people"" interchangeably BC both are doing it, but the women are definitely more prevalent."
d50ttep,d50vd24_1,Insomniadict,"There are multiple different forms of empowerment. One is what you're referring to, which is gaining influence and resources. Another is the personal sense of empowerment (otherwise known as self-esteem, confidence, pride). What people are talking about when they refer to posting sexy pictures as empowering is the second one. Both are equally valid."
d50ttep,d50vd24_2,Insomniadict,"Getting paid for something isn't necessarily empowering (in the personal sense) because it has the possibility of taking free will out of the equation. Using paid modeling as an example, people who become paid models are often pressured to conform to certain body types, clothing styles, hair styles, etc, due to what their employers want. This can become very dis-empowering if it is not something that the model actually likes about themself."
d50ttep,d50vi3b,barkleycharles420,"But doesn't getting paid give you more free will?
Yes, I know modeling can be very disempowering, much like the same way porn can be. But I still believe if the woman WANTS to do it and as long as she gets paid, that is an aspect that IS empowering."
d50ttep,d50vybm,Insomniadict,"What I'm saying is that under the colloquial definition of empowerment that people mean when they say the word (confidence, self-respect), it doesn't matter whether or not you are paid for it, just so long as you are taking pride in what you are doing. And if you are getting paid for it, even better! "
dad7ghx,dad7raa_1,BostonDrivingIsWorse,"Thanks for the first well-thought out argument in a day of tiresome, repetitive debate.
&gt;That doesn't mean you give their position equal weight, just that you recognize where the dissent exists.

dad7ghx,dadtcjq_1,BostonDrivingIsWorse,"&gt;The media can't just say ""here are the two competing arguments, and here's which one of them is total crap"".
Of course they can, and they should, instead of using the guise of neutrality. Not going so far as to say ""this is total crap"" (value judgement), but it is definitely within bounds to explain that one argument is not factually sound by every measure we posses, or that one candidate's argument on an issue is non-existent, while the other at least has an idea. That would be objective reporting, which much of the media claims to do."
dad7ghx,dadtcjq_2,BostonDrivingIsWorse,"&gt;Now, throw the whole thing in a blender, where what I consider to be an obvious truth, and what someone from the other side of the aisle considers to be the obvious truth on the same issue.
This is when both sides should be represented equally- when there is no objective truth that we can measure."
dad7ghx,dadtcjq_3,BostonDrivingIsWorse,"We don't have instruments to measure the will of god, so it will forever be unknown what is fact."
dad7ghx,dadtulo_1,Krongu,"Objective reporting is broadcasting what each candidate said. Going as far as attacking either candidate is blatantly and unquestionably partisan; whether you think that being partisan is justified is another matter.
And I think that mainstream media being given that onus would likely provoke more partisanship, just on a larger level. You'd have FOX and MSNBC often saying ""this argument has no basis"" with regards to factually murky matters."
dad7ghx,dadtwrv,BostonDrivingIsWorse,"&gt; Going as far as attacking either candidate is blatantly and unquestionably partisan

True, but I didn't advocate for attacking a candidate. That would be ad-hom, and not based in the candidate's rhetoric."

di6to3u,di6to3u_1,MikulkaCS,"It may be what you say, but the people who are fighting for the movement don't understand what they are fighting for, they are wanting being obese and unhealthy to be accepted as if its a normal thing, it is not a normal thing, the people fighting against it are generally informing these people of the severe health risks involved, and aren't saying that these people should feel worthless or hate themselves, but instead should exercise and take better care of their body, because that is truly how they can live a better, and healthier life. It isn't a game about feelings or hate, it is about spreading the urgency of the situation of being obese, it is a serious problem and too many people think that being severely overweight is okay. It can lead to many health problems and usually leads to an untimely death."
di6to3u,di6to3u_2,MikulkaCS,"Finally, if they care so much about themselves not being hated or feeling worthless, they wouldn't be treating their own body like that, as if it is a dump and shouldn't be cared for.

di6to3u,di6yix9,MikulkaCS,"To me, knowing that having extra fat on me will most likley kill me, or at least harm me in various ways, that is enough to motivate me to not stay in that shape. So if they don't want to put in the effort they can live horribly and eat like a pig, go ahead."
di6to3u,di6znqo_1,on_my_lunch_break,"Look... the kind of behavior that leads to the weight problems you're describing are habitual, addictive, and typically learned during childhood. People know,  rationally,  that they should behave better... but when it comes to everyday behavior, that doesn't factor in.
And often, people try to make better choices only to fail miserably. They'll order the chicken salad instead of the burger and fries, not realizing it actually has *more* calories.  They'll overestimate their exercise vs caloric splurges. They'll overserve portions."
di6to3u,di6znqo_2,on_my_lunch_break,"My point is this:  just because someone is fat doesn't mean they want to be. Behavior can be incredibly difficult to change because people have various psychological hangups, just like with sex/relationships. Even when they try to change things, they often fail. That's why compassion is important here, and why self-love is important too."
di6to3u,di6znqo_3,on_my_lunch_break,As an  aside: what's the heaviest weight you've ever been in your life?  Do you actually know what it's like to be obese?
di6to3u,di75c5s_1,MikulkaCS,"You cannot be that overweight if the only problem is not knowing exactly how many calories is in things and whatnot, I don't care if you are a few pounds overweight, that's not the kind of fat I mean, everybody gets a little chubby from time to time, but it's when people end up 300 pounds and resemble a blow up flotation device for a pool, then they are having serious problems."
di6to3u,di75c5s_2,MikulkaCS,"The heaviest weight I have been is about 170, and that was when I was the most in shape, I am not fat, never have had more than a little belly fat, and I never have been obese, that doesn't mean I understand what it means to be obese, or have these problems, I prevent myself from eating badly, I keep track of the fats in the food I eat. There are no excuses to be overweight to the point where you develop serious health issues. Again, I don't mean the people who are only a bit on the heavier side, I mean the people who literally are developing rolls where rolls have never been before."
dwm2e4h,dwm2e4h_1,indoremeter,"North Korean nuclear weapons are completely useless to deter a US attack as they cannot reach the US. The only major powers that they can reach are China and Russia, with which it shares borders. If the US really intended a major attack on North Korea, it would have to get the consent of China and Russia to avoid accidentally starting a major nuclear war, and would probably start military action by destroying any site that might hold nuclear weapons."
dwm2e4h,dwm2e4h_2,indoremeter,"However, the North Korean weapons are not for defence at all. They are part of a strategy to keep the leader in power. The strategy is a very old and effective one - unite the people against the outside threat. It is in Kim Jong-Un's interest to make America look threatening and pretend that all the citizens must support him in the interests of everyone. This is why he employs inflammatory rhetoric and is surely delighted at Donald Trump's responses. He was probably totally taken aback by Trump's acceptance of the offer to meet, which I expect was expected to be refused and then be used as an example to the North Korean people of how unreasonable the Americans are."
dwm2e4h,dwm2e4h_3,indoremeter,"While China is generally thought to disapprove of the North Korean government, China has quite reasonable fears that, in the event of war or other disaster. millions of refugees will flood across the border overwhelming the local resources and forcing China to either devote a lot of resources to help the people or look extremely callous by letting them die (or, indeed, killing them to prevent them stealing everything from local Chinese people). However, North Korea is in generally a pretty bad state, with famine only being averted by foreign aid, so eventually China may decide that the situation is hopeless and it's better to act on its own timetable rather than having to react to some crisis. In fact, China seems to have been cutting off supplies to North Korea for a while, which may be a last attempt to get the government of North Korea to reform to the point that the country is not always so close to disaster."
dwm2e4h,dwm38ud_1,icebrotha,"&gt;North Korean nuclear weapons are completely useless to deter a US attack as they cannot reach the US. The only major powers that they can reach are China and Russia, with which it shares borders.
I can't address the rest of your argument because it is built on a an incorrect premise. The main reason why North Korea's nuclear capability is a deterrence to the US is that they'll certainly eventually be able to reach the US with it, and probably currently can reach SK and Japan our very close allies."
dwm2e4h,dwm38ud_2,icebrotha,"If you assume the only thing that deters the US from attacking NK is the safety of people on US soil, then you are operating off of a false assumption."
dwm2e4h,dwmd38k,WaitingToBeBanned,"Adding to this: A missile does not need to reach the continental US to hit an American target. They have bases and everything all over the world, including but not limited to South Korea and Japan."
dwm2e4h,dwnkrf5,indoremeter,"If the missiles could reach the 48 states, I would upgrade the assessment to ""almost completely useless"". Meaningful deterrence against the USA would require the ability to destroy large parts of the USA while simultaneously under attack fro the USA. Major nuclear powers like China and Russia might be able ot do that, but North Korea is very far away from that indeed (and would not be allowed to reach that point). Any use of nuclear weapons against the US or its allies by a weak country like North Korea would result in immediate retaliation and would provoke such outrage that the instigator simply would not survive. In the case of North Korea, considering that China would not like to have America occupy a bordering country, I suspect that China would immediately invade North Korea, depose the government, and hand over any surviving senior officals to the USA to try to prevent an American invasion. Even if China did nothing, it would be like the Iraqui invasion of Kuwait - countries would either join in a retaliatory action or sit back and watch the action."
dwm2e4h,dwnrchp,WaitingToBeBanned,"Not true. All that is required is to kill a lot of people or do a lot of damage, when pressured that is.

Nuclear powers can do a lot more than that within half an hour."
dwm2e4h,dwoy9w9,indoremeter,"The surest way for a nation state to commit suicide is to attack a major power - such as the USA - killing a lot of people, or ding a lot of damage, without causing complete destruction. As Machiavelli wrote ""men ought either to be well treated or crushed"". The USA would certainly not surrender to a major attack, but would seek revenge."

e337ccl,e33jg3p_2,involver,"Not being engaged when your vote has a 1% chance of making a difference? Intellectual sloth, sure.
.0000000000001% chance? At this point it wouldn't be very smart to waste time going to the polls.
Obviously it's going to be somewhere in the middle but it's also a matter of each person's values. For example what if I'm an Olympic athlete, would you excuse me for being apolitical if I would rather spend time learning more about my sport than being informed on all the issues?"

e337ccl,e35a8kr_1,damsterick,"Does your vote have to make a difference for it to be worth your time? I disagree with this stance personally. I vote as long as I think I am submitting to a cause I believe is the correct one. In our society, hardly anything most individuals do has a direct influence. To say that what you do does not have an influence on the whole can rationalize a lot of behavior - not behaving ecologically, not voting, throwing specific trash (e.g. medicine, electronics, batteries) to mixed waste etc. Why do you give money to charity? You think these few dollars a month will make a difference? Why do you recycle? You think a few bottles of plastic will make a difference in the billions of tons of plastic waste? Why do you vote? You think one vote will change the functioning of the country? All these come down to excusing and rationalizing not doing something to feel better. To me, that is sloth. Not voting because you don't think it's worth your time is intellectual sloth in my eyes, as long as you bring arguments that hold no water (which you did). If someone has a reason for not voting that seems legit, e.g. travel distance for a very old man that is unable to walk, personal ideology etc., it does not seem like sloth to me. Not voting because you think you can't change the world anyway is sloth, even if you think of a post hoc argument about it not being worth your time. You are arguing for an individualistic stance in a very, very socially determinent culture. If you think you personally will make a difference in anything, it's time to open your eyes. You might as well not do anything to benefit the society as long as it does not benefit you directly. That's not just sloth, that is also selfish."
e337ccl,e35a8kr_2,damsterick,"You do not have to be engaged to vote. You can have more methodologies to decide who you vote for, be it the opinion of someone you trust, your gut or simply the party you sympathize with. I don't think it necessarily takes up more time of your day than pooping does. You are literally arguing that voting is not worth the time. How long does voting take? I am not an US citizen, but here, it takes me about 30 minutes. It takes some people longer, but I doubt it can take anyone longer than a few hours to vote. You are arguing that it is not worth your time to vote. Few hours once per year maximum. Don't you still think it's sloth involved? It seems like calculating the actual odds may take up more time than actual voting."
e337ccl,e35a8kr_3,damsterick,"It is not judgmental to call it intellectual sloth without knowing the odds, because as I tried to explain above, it's an empty argument. It's judgmental to ignore other person's values though, I agree. I don't think OP is guilty of that.
If you are implying that to vote you need to be, i cite, ""informed about all the issues"", then that is a wrong implication nobody is arguing for. You obviously do not have to do that, hardly anybody does that. An athlete who openly states that he/she does not vote because it does not seem worth his/her time will lose my respect instantly, even if that was a world champion. This attitude is partly why the US president is a complete bimbo, because many people did not think their vote mattered. We're not all individuals that matter. We're a little like ants - a functioning society where the organism is what matters, but if all individually decide on something, the organism changes."

Some people are easier to read than others but every little tattoo, piercing, shirt wrinkle, hairstyle, piece of clothing (the list could continue on forever), could definitely be interpenetrated  to show a little characteristic about a person and who they really are.

You can judge a book by its cover. You can judge a person by their appearance.

549_A,t1_ckicnlx_1,ablarga,"I have an interesting story about this, hopefully it's alright if I post an anecdote in response to your CMV.
My friend and I went hiking one weekend, so I wore some dirty old khaki cargo pants and a dirty old black t-shirt, and I had my hair pulled back in a weird half-ponytail. I'm a woman, and I have short hair, so that didn't look very flattering, but I didn't care because it kept the hair out of my eyes while we hiked. I didn't have any makeup on either, because, well hiking."
549_A,t1_ckicnlx_2,ablarga,"By the end we were dirty and sweaty, and my friend had a pair of passes to the fancy fitness club where he worked, so we went there to relax in their hot tub. I had a bathing suit to change into, but I walked into the club with my friend in my raggedy hiking clothes."
549_A,t1_ckicnlx_3,ablarga,"Now, he pulls off the rugged guy look rather well, so he didn't look as bad as me. He gives the front desk lady the passes and points out the one for him, and the one for me. This is the conversation:
Him: ""Yes, this pass is for me, and that one is for ablarga."""
549_A,t1_ckicnlx_4,ablarga,"Her: ""Oh, ablarga. Is she coming later?"" (I'm standing *right* next to him, and there's no one else in line.)
Him: ""No....this is ablarga.""
You should have seen the look the front desk lady gave me. I might as well have burst into flames right there. She saw me, dirty and raggedy, and already came to the conclusion that I was just a dirty, raggedy, good for nothing person that didn't deserve to even be acknowledged. She let us through with lips so pursed they turned white. On the way out, she very politely said goodbye to my friend, and didn't even acknowledge me."
549_A,t1_ckicnlx_5,ablarga,"What she didn't realize, was that at the time I was a stellar law student, a designer, and a business owner, that I was an actually intelligent and interesting person who, in about a year or two, *would be exactly the kind of client the club would want.* She judged me by my dirty, raggedy, cover and deemed me ""unworthy."" Oh well, their loss."
549_A,t1_ckicnlx_6,ablarga,"I guess the moral is, don't let your judgement lead to you being rude, hateful or condescending to a person. That's what I've always taken the phrase to mean."
909_A,t3_2atya5,thename226,"A woman only needs to lose weight and be thin to be found attractive, basically just a low body fat %. A man needs to lose fat AND gait muscle to be found attractive. Even then, the body fat percentage that men need for their muscles to show is less than that of women. Take [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/FwZAX2Q.jpg) for example, everyone would agree that anything much below 15-17% in women is too thin, even at 30% women are hot. Take men now, personally I find 10-12% and 15% hot. Looking at the exercises men and women need to do, men would have to lift weights and eat more calories than they spend and gain fat and muscle (bulk), then eat fewer calories than they spend while still lifting to lose the fat without losing much of the muscle, and repeat. All a woman needs to do is do cardio and eat fewer calories than she spends and she'll lose weight. She can always lift weights too but that's optional.

Edit: Since some of the comments brought it up, I should mention that I am specifically talking about young (early 20s) people here so age and and pregnancies aren't a consideration. Additionally, I need to clarify  that this is basically a counter point to women saying it is hard to meet today's beauty standards.

Also, since I'm doing an edit, it is worth noting that women generally rate men as less attractive than men, source: http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/ .

Edit 2: There is still some confusion in the comments so I need to clarify a few things.

1. This is just about having the right body type.

2. Right body type for what? Who says what's hot? The media. So we're talking about the standard muscular man and thin woman.

Edit 3: One of the commenters put it very well, see this: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2atya5/cmv_it_is_easier_for_women_to_look_hot_than_it_is/ciz08bo

909_A,t1_ciza7xp_1,[deleted],"Men have less body fat on average. Women need more for their functions. Some women actually lose their period on 22%. Men, iirc, also deal with calorie reduction better than women.
It's easier for women to look good but easier for them to look bad as well, imo.
A woman without makeup who wears it everyday normally will get a bunch of ""are you okay?"" and ""are you tired?"" messages. And in in SK, for instance, men use makeup in notable [numbers](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2013/05/south-korean-men-cosmetics-crazed/). Men need to shave less (or hell, wax less), workout similarly or maybe a bit more, and dress well. The choices men have for dressing well are more constrained (women typically wear dresses, skirts, jeans, shorts, etc.) so it's easier for them to look good, imo. The rules aren't as cut and dry with women. Large breasts, small waist, small hips? Wear this, this, or this, or you'll look disproportionate and like a balloon. The same goes for other body types. Due to that fits are really fucked up for women's clothing. Men have less areas that vary and more clothes that are measured by the inch or cm."
909_A,t1_ciza7xp_2,[deleted],"And if we're talking about anti-aging creams or something, nothing is stopping men from using ""women's"" products except lack of marketing (see: Bic razor's successful campaign to convince women shaving was important)."
909_A,t1_cizaepa_1,thename226,"&gt; The choices men have for dressing well are more constrained (women typically wear dresses, skirts, jeans, shorts, etc.) so it's easier for them to look good, imo.

Due to that fits are really fucked up for women's clothing. Men have less areas that vary and more clothes that are measured by the inch or cm.
I see this as an advantage for women. You have something to wear for every body type to make it look good. Yes, it requires learning what looks good but it is advantageous. It's cold? Pants. It's hot? Short shorts. Still hot? skirts. It's cold and want to wear a skirt? Leggings. Men don't even have the option to wear short shorts or skirts if it's hot."
909_A,t1_cizatk7_1,[deleted],"Yes, we might have the chance to look better, but our body differences are more obvious than men's. And those extra features mean devoting even MORE to looking good. It's not necessarily easy. We have the opportunity to look so much worse. Men's body types are more similar as an average if you adjust for body fat percentage (imo) that looking poor in what looks good on a similar male is a lot harder."
909_A,t1_cizatk7_2,[deleted],"So if there were a number line where 0 was ""okay"", negative numbers were on the left, and positive numbers were right, and you rated the attractiveness of women on it, women would be more likely to have a distribution in the further negatives and positives. I think men would have much less of an exaggerated distribution."
911_A,t3_2atkq9,adobefootball,"I believe that most of her examples of irony are instances of situational and cosmic irony. 

Rain on a wedding day would be an example of situational irony because many women plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control.  Morisette is accessing the culturally shared vision of the woman who has been planning a wedding since she was a little girl.  The rain shows what little control we actually have and exposes how our expectations do not meet reality.  

The guy who is in the plane crash says ""well isn't this nice"" (verbal irony).  Also he has a reasonable expectation that his plane would not crash because that is a very rare occurrence, and it is the first plane trip he ever went on, but it crashed creating a mismatch between expectation and reality (situational irony).  I suppose the man expected the plane to crash because of his fear of flying, so it is not ironic for him, but the characters around the man probably expected that he would end up somewhere safe.  

A traffic jam when you are already late is not very ironic I guess.  

10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife creates the image of a person going through a collection of flatware thinking that eventually there will be a knife.  the expectation that a huge collection of flatware would have more than just spoons seems reasonable, but that expectation is challenged by reality (situational irony).  

The free ride when you have already paid is also ironic because winning anything beats the expectation of not winning already expressed by the character's buying of one ride (situational irony).  

Meeting the man of your dreams accesses a shared and unrealistic (but nonetheless present) movie magic fantasy of falling in love.  This expectation is immediately crushed when you meet his beautiful wife.  This is cosmic or situational irony.  The idea that you are an important part of the universe and you have a fate or destiny that is significant is pervasive.  When the universe torpedoes that expected reality, you have cosmic irony.

The most common rebuttal I am familiar with is that her examples are more about bad timing or bad luck.  To that I say that there are many instances of bad timing or bad luck that create ironic situations.  Irony, timing, and luck are not mutually exclusive factors in any described event.

A less common rebuttal I hear is that I am seeing more than what is there.  According to this argument, irony must be tacky and cranked up to eleven.  I disagree.  Subtle irony is irony too.  Also literary analysis through describing imagery is acceptable in both prose and poetry.  I feel that Morissette was unfairly criticized because of her gender, age, and medium (pop music).

The final rebuttal I am familiar with is that Morissette agreed with many of these criticisms and defended herself by admitting that she did not understand irony that well.  Her admission needs to be taken into context.  It was made after many intellectuals tore her song a new one.  She was very smart to not double-down in the face of such criticism."
911_A,t1_ciysfit_1,hacksoncode,"Most of the people that deride this song don't consider situational or cosmic irony to be valid instances of irony in the first place, and are irritated by the continuing cultural references that reinforce this bastardized view of ""irony"" that we have lately adopted.
One of the problems with these new definitions of ""irony"" is that the describe things that are so vague that any one can point at nearly any situation that is even slightly coincidental or annoying and come up with a pseudo-argument that it could be considered ""ironic"" by the ever-changing goalposts of irony."
911_A,t1_ciysfit_2,hacksoncode,"Your strained apologia for Morrisette's own admitted misunderstanding of what irony is are a prime example of the horrors of this new concept of irony.
If these things are irony, practically everything is irony. Which, sadly, means that nothing really is irony. Even by the standards of situational irony, you have to mangle the meaning of that definition past the breaking point to include almost any of the things in the song."
911_A,t1_ciysfit_3,hacksoncode,"Weddings are expected to comprise a marriage. Rain is irrelevant to this expectation. Not ironic.
Good catch on the verbal (proper) irony in the airplane example, it's one of only 2 examples of actual irony in the entire song. The situation certainly isn't ironic. The man expected flying to be dangerous. It was dangerous. No irony."
911_A,t1_ciysfit_4,hacksoncode,"There is no expectation when one needs a knife that has anything to do with spoons. Spoons are just a nonsequitor. There's no irony here.
When you pay for a ride, you expect to get to the destination. A free ride does not challenge or invert this expectation at all. Simply not ironic."
911_A,t1_ciysfit_5,hacksoncode,"Meeting a desirable man practically screams out a reasonable expectation that he is taken, by definition. There's nothing ironic about it turning out that he is. It's just disappointing.
I could give a thousand examples of how these situations could have turned out ""situationally ironic"" that would have been vastly superior, whether in being blatantly ironic, or in being subtly ironic. Her examples are overly simplistic attempts at being ""sledgehammer tacky ironic"" and almost every one of them fails at being even that, much less ""subtle""."
911_A,t1_ciyt75m_1,adobefootball,"Irony in naturalist fiction is generally accepted which tends to be very similar to cosmic irony.  Situational irony is also generally accepted and the definition of situational irony is not ""new"".  Furthermore I feel that your analysis of the events mentioned is limited, highly selective, and stems from a bias to stay within the pervasive and accepted prejudice against this song.  You give no reason to limit our analysis of the scenes to your interpretation and you do not engage my broader analyses."
911_A,t1_ciyt75m_2,adobefootball,"There was no response to my discussion of Americans' cultural expectations not matching reality (rain on wedding day and meeting man of your dreams).
You selectively narrow the point of view to only the man in the plane and not the kids he kissed goodby who may have had the expectation that he would return."
911_A,t1_ciyt75m_3,adobefootball,"You also narrow the point of view in the spoons example.  Your argument can be rephrased as ""spoons can not ever be part of an ironic situation when a person expects a knife"".  I see no actual meat to this argument.
The person who bought the ride did not expect to win the free one.  If she did, she would have waited for all the free ones to be distributed before buying one."
911_A,t1_ciyt75m_4,adobefootball,"You accuse the song of ""sledgehammer tacky"" examples and claim that you could improve them.  However, much of the criticism of the song I am familiar with is that the situations were not ironic enough.  I imagine that your ""improvements"" would probably be sharper and thus more representative of the descriptor ""sledgehammer tacky"".  Feel free to try that would probably convince me."
911_A,t1_ciyt75m_5,adobefootball,"The closest thing you said to change my mind is that expanding irony to include more subtle variations may make the term meaningless.  However, who sets the bright line?  There is danger and confusion when we limit our analysis to fit our prejudices.  I feel that there is greater danger in deliberately interpreting literature in a narrow sense than in a broad one.  I fear that critics have put Alanis on the other side of the line and deliberately narrowed their analysis for reasons other than the definition of Irony."
911_A,t1_ciytv7f_1,hacksoncode,"The supposed subtle irony you discuss, both by a generous interpretation, and by Ms. Morrisette's admission, is not what was intended. Instead *you* have created irony out if these situations, almost entirely from the whole cloth.
What it appears to have been, and what she has said it was, is an attempt at extremely broad and crude irony that went entirely awry."
911_A,t1_ciytv7f_2,hacksoncode,"I see no good reason to assume that she had this sophisticated a view on irony.
I challenge you to come up with *any* ""unfortunate"" and/or coincidental situation that anyone could not analyze in almost exactly the same fashion that you did here, to conclude that it was some kind of broader or deeper irony."
911_A,t1_ciytv7f_3,hacksoncode,"To all appearances, when she talked about spoons and knives, she was attempting to claim a broad obvious irony that simply doesn't exist.
If she stumbled into some subtle (unto being nearly indiscernable) irony accidentally, it's bad art for that reason."
911_A,t1_ciz34c0_1,hacksoncode,"While I would agree with what you're saying here, OP seems to think that anything where something happens that's contrary to expectations is ""ironic"".
When you are heading to the kitchen at work, you're obviously expecting to be eating lunch and having a pleasant discussion with coworkers, rather than hopping around in excruciating pain. As you say, not ironic, but it would be by OP's arguments."
911_A,t1_ciz34c0_2,hacksoncode,"Also, ""clearly"" when you dress for a party, you're trying to make a statement about your individualism, only to have your hopes and expectations dashed and the folly of your vanity exposed. Argh... yeah, not ironic, unless you're OP."
911_A,t1_ciz7vj4_1,hacksoncode,"The problem with that theory is that the cultural connotations of a wedding are of mixed worry and excitement, planning and expectation of the unexpected. Rain (or other inclement weather) is a thing that is almost always planned for in one way or another, particularly for outdoor weddings.
One can ignore half of that cultural context and call it ""ironic"" if one wants, but it really isn't."
1258_A,t3_24pgmg,Unrelated_Incident,"I believe that the sorting of comments is improved when people downvote almost as frequently as they upvote.  We are all familiar with the phenomenon of late posts getting buried and early posts remaining at the top of the thread.  This phenomenon is the direct result of the fact that most people only read the first few comments in a thread combined with the fact that people tend to upvote significantly more than they downvote.

Let me use a hypothetical example to explain my point.  Imagine there is a 5 hour old thread with 100 comments in it and the top five comments are all mediocre comments that 50% of people who read them upvote.  Then someone posts an extremely high quality comment that over 90% of people who read it upvote.  This comment starts with 1 upvote so it is at position 70 or so out of the 100 comments.  So after a couple hours 1000 people view the comments, 100% of them view the first five comments and only about 2% of them view the 70th comment.  So the top five mediocre comments would get upvotes from 50% of the 1000 people (500 upvotes) and the amazing post at position 70 would get upvotes form 90% of the people who read it (18 upvotes).  I hope this illustrates how, in a world where people only use upvotes and not downvotes, top posts will tend to remain at the top even if they are only moderately good comments while great comments that are posted late will tend to remain near the middle or bottom (unless they are linked to by /r/bestof or something).

I think we can all agree that it is more desirable to have comments sorted by perceived quality than by some other arbitrary method (how early you posted).  If instead of only using upvotes, people used downvotes just as frequently, this problem is greatly improved.  In the same example as before let’s assume that everyone votes, up or down, on every post they read.  So instead of just not upvoting the posts that they feel don’t deserve an upvote, they downvote it.  In this situation, 50% of people would upvote the top five posts and 50% of people would downvote them, so even though only 2% of people actually go down the list to read the high quality 70th post, its upvote count will still rise faster than the top five mediocre posts.

I believe that in a subreddit such as /r/CMV you should not downvote opinions just because you disagree with them, but I also think that you shouldn’t upvote comments just because you agree with them for the same reason.  You should upvote comments that you feel are of high quality and downvote comments you feel are of low quality.  We want the comments to be sorted from best to worst so that when someone visits a thread they will be confronted with the most compelling arguments first.

So that is why I think it is misguided for the mods of /r/CMV to encourage people to not downvote posts *in general*.  I totally support them asking people to not vote just based on whether they agree or disagree with someone, but I think people should vote both up and down based on how compelling they feel the argument is.

I’m going to preempt a few concerns here:

1) Downvoting discourages people from voicing unpopular opinions.

First off, I don’t think you should downvote an opinion for being unpopular, but only if you think it is a bad argument (i.e. it is a logical fallacy or it makes some assertions that are objectively wrong, like if they claimed that we shouldn’t invade Iran because it’s in South America).  Secondly, I think it’s more important to sort comments properly than to worry about people’s feelings getting hurt from negative karma.  I think if you are avoiding posting things because you are worried about a negative karma score, that is pretty ridiculous.


2) Even if most people think a comment is low quality, that doesn’t mean everyone will think so.  By downvoting comments that the majority of people find low quality, you are making it less likely that someone who might find it compelling will see it.

You could make the same argument against sorting it by upvotes only.  “Just because the majority of people consider a post to be high quality doesn’t mean everyone will and by allowing the highest upvoted comments to rise to the top you are pushing the less popular posts to the bottom making them less likely to be seen by someone who isn’t convinced by the popular arguments.”  I think if you want to make this argument, you can’t just make it against downvotes, but against sorting by perceived quality in general.


3) If people downvote OP’s comments, he/she won’t get as many responses so it will be harder to change their view.

I agree 100% with this and you should never downvote OP’s comments in their own thread.  But if you aren’t the OP, then I think it is better to address the most compelling arguments.


4)  It is better to report arguments that break the rules than to downvote them.

I am not talking about comments that violate the rules.  I am talking about totally legitimate comments that address the topic with real questions and concerns.  But if there are a lot of really great comments, they should be sorted in a logical way with the best comments first and the worst comments last.  Yes, you should report any comments that violate the rules.  Other than that, you should upvote comments you find especially good and downvote comments you find especially bad.  Maybe there are two comments making the same point but one does so with referenced sources and the other does so without sources and in a confusing or arrogant way.  So upvote the better one and downvote the worse one even though neither of them needs to be reported.


**EDIT**:  I'd also like to add that I don't think there is really any value in downvoting people into the negatives unless they are trolling.  I can see how that would be disheartening to people trying to contribute while not really adding anything to the sorting.  I would suggest that people down't downvote comments that are made in good faith that are already at 0.

This would be great if that was how the community responded. But it won't and changing all the visitors to Reddit to post with this philosophy in mind is going to be impossible."
1258_A,t1_ch9x7xg_2,[deleted],"&gt;Secondly, I think it’s more important to sort comments properly than to worry about people’s feelings getting hurt from negative karma.
Again, you are talking about how people should conduct themselves, which seems pretty totalitarian to be honest. I don't think we should go around waving fingers at people, but instead it should be more important to work the system in a way to manipulate how people naturally respond to things."
1258_A,t1_ch9x7xg_3,[deleted],"For example, if people are going generally Upvote = Good/Agree, down vote = Bad/Disagree, why wouldn't it better to sort the comments by which comments are closer to 50/50. Which would put the most split comments at the top.
I also think the tree system in reddit is pretty bad, and when comments are open it would be better to only have the root comments appear. If the first comment is interesting then open up a further stem of the root comment voluntarily or move on to a different perspective which is more interesting."
1258_A,t1_ch9x7xg_4,[deleted],Downvotes and dissident views are generally buried and discouraged on this sight which in general is bad. I think a better solution to this is track upvote/downvote separately.
1258_A,t1_cha51oy_1,Unrelated_Incident,"&gt;I also think the tree system in reddit is pretty bad, and when comments are open it would be better to only have the root comments appear.
I think you can set it to do this by default with RES.  If not, I definitely agree that you should be able to."
1258_A,t1_cha51oy_2,Unrelated_Incident,"&gt;For example, if people are going generally Upvote = Good/Agree, down vote = Bad/Disagree, why wouldn't it better to sort the comments by which comments are closer to 50/50.
Because I downvote bad comments even if I agree with them, and most people also do this.  For instance, I would downvote if someone posted in this thread a comment such as:  ""D0wnV0t3s= **AWESOME**"".  I agree with their comment because I do think downvotes are awesome, but I would downvote the comment because it doesn't add anything to the discussion.  I think a high ratio of upvotes to downvotes is a better way of sorting than by a ratio close to one, because you are going to get a lot of low quality comments with ratios close to one."

Sometimes doing drugs lets to step away from the way you see things. Helping to remove or minimize all the short cuts and ingrained ways of thinking  you have developed over the course of your life and view topics/ideas/problems from new and unique perspectives.
When doing mind altering drugs you change the way that normal stimuli are experienced, which may cause them to elicit new thoughts or experiences themselves.

Most critical to this aim, is the hiring of professors that are good at teaching. 

Being good at teaching can be roughly defined as the ability to help students understand a subject. Many schools go to great lengths to judge the teaching ability of their professors, conducting surveys, eliciting student recommendations, etc. However, I have never seen a question like ""were you able to understand the professor's speech during lectures?"" 

I have some professors that speak in such a thick accent that I have to strain to make out their words. This has a huge impact on my ability to learn (and therefore the professors ability to teach). Therefore, if a university does claim to value teaching ability in its employees, it should consider the speaking ability of its employees."
1561_A,t1_cfu7ye4,themcos,"Well, I had a lot of experience with thick accented professors. It's obviously true that they're harder to understand, all else being equal. But all else is most certainly *not* equal. I had a professor with a very thick German accent that took getting used to, but he was absolutely one of the best teachers I've ever met. I suppose if you could find an otherwise equivalent teacher but without the accent, that would be a bit better, but I don't think that person exists, and as a result his hiring was absolutely the right call, and in my experience this line of reasoning has held for the majority of my heavy accent professors to varying degrees."
1561_A,t1_cfum9jw_1,skrillexisokay,"I guess we're dealing with degrees at this point. If you are trying to learn biology (or some other subject with lots of terminology) and you literally can't make out the words being said, teaching skill is only going to do so much. But if you just have to strain or guess a little bit, maybe it can be outweighed."
1561_A,t1_cfum9jw_2,skrillexisokay,What would you think of a requirement for foreign professors and TAs to take a semester-long English Pronunciation course?
1561_A,t1_cfuptvj_1,themcos,"Honestly, I think they'd probably be insulted and take it personally and would be more likely to take positions at other schools that had no such requirement. And while maybe it wouldn't be universal, I would suspect most people would prefer to be taught by the best and the brightest despite their accents over some pretty smart guys that speak clearer English. I would predict that that school would lose considerable prestige."
1561_A,t1_cfuptvj_2,themcos,"&gt; and you literally can't make out the words being said
I have to admit I'm skeptical about this. It would be kind of lame to call out a specific professor or school, but I'm genuinely interested in what kinds of classes you're taking and how often this is such a big issue."
1561_A,t1_cfuptvj_3,themcos,"Personally, I went to a pretty high end school for CS and Physics, and while there were a lot of thick accents, it was always pretty easy to get used to, especially coupled with what their writing on the board or put in their slides."
1831_A,t3_1u4fqn,CleanMyWounds53013,"I think we should kill those who are mentally and physically disabled, as they are a waste of resources and cannot physically or mentally contribute to society. We should also kill rapists, murderers, armed robbers and other violent criminals which we have concrete evidence for. If not killing them, they should be subject to physical labor with no pay. I think this because we are wasting money and resources on keeping people alive. I know executing costs a lot more than life imprisonment, but this is because of judicial fees."
1831_A,t1_ceejtd2_1,MadBoyyy,"Wow.
You keep talking about ""contributing to society"", what does that even mean? who defines what qualifies as ""contributing"". Are you even contributing to society? What have you done to contribute to society?
A mentally and physically disabled person at the very least can inspire others to be more productive or at least make people feel less sorry for themselves and feel thankful for they have."
1831_A,t1_ceejtd2_2,MadBoyyy,"Im sure you are thinking ""Well, thats not a very big contribution at all, we should still kill them"". Consider this, at what point do we judge how much ""contribution"" is worthy.
If the world took your approach, then why wouldnt we go all the way?  You can say Bill Gates has contributed a hell of a lot more to society than you and almost everybody else. I would say its safe to assume that you have made no where near the ""contribution"" to society that he has made. In fact, in comparison to Bill Gates and other people with large amounts of ""contribution to society"" you are about as a ""waste of resources"" as a mentally and physically disabled person. So we should kill you, right?"

2099_A,t3_1o2tau,mixmutch,"This could be stemmed from my poor social experiences or from what i learnt in my psychology diploma, and soon recently came to the conclusion that there is no true kindness/altruism whatever you call it. 

For a behavior to happen, there needs to be some sort of motivation. Intrinsic or extrinsic, there is a need for people to behave a certain way. Extrinsic motivation is plain and simple. The most common is money. People work for money, people steal for money, people who do charity gain acceptance of society, which in turn lets them earn more from their enterprises since the company they represent is more accepted. That's what i believe. 

Even if there is an intrinsic motivation, the person definitely have to do it for his or her own cause. For example, a generous person who makes self-sacrifices for others could gain satisfaction in his own mind that he's done something ""good"" and the social acceptance which he gets would motivate him to do more kind deeds, since society as a whole promotes pro-social behaviors. 

Or someone sees an injustice and steps in for the victim. The person seeing the injustice could just be annoyed at the situation and in order to resolve the annoyance he steps in to help the weak. I would also think that that's just a method for the person to deal with some internal unsolved issues to make himself/herself feel better. For example, a man who was a bully victim steps in to fight off some bullies because he did not have the courage to stand up to them when he was younger. Because of that, he may feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in himself. Thus, since there is a personal gain, I do not see pure kindness. 

So basically even when someone does something good or kind, i would attribute it to his or her need to be socially accepted or the self-satisfaction, and when there's personal gain from displaying pro-social behaviors, I do not believe that people can have pure kindness. But hey, that's just my opinion man.


Edit: ok basically, I believe that there will always be personal benefits when someone does some kind deed that is beneficial to others. Without the personal benefit, nobody will do anything solely for the benefit of others. 

No matter how I looked at things, I can always attribute acts if kindness with some form of personal gains. 

I may not have phrased it correctly saying that everyone is selfish. I just tend to be quite avoidant at times and think the worst of people. Lol

Edit2: so many people talked about positive and negative values. So my question is: how do you determine the TRUE values of one's motivations for an action? "
2099_A,t1_ccofru6_1,marlow41,"For there to be any meaningful discussion here, you have to define ""true kindness/altruism.""
&gt;For example, a generous person who makes self-sacrifices for others could gain satisfaction in his own mind that he's done something ""good""
That's pretty much it (excluding the end of that sentence on purpose). That's why I do good things. Generally speaking I do not get any satisfaction from having other people approve of my doing good things. To be honest, when other people notice me doing something good and laud me for it, I tend to be annoyed by it and less likely to do whatever that thing is."
2099_A,t1_ccofru6_2,marlow41,"What I think you're failing to realize is that your view is more optimistic than the fairy tale. The fairy tale view is that people are basically good or bad naturally. Your view seems to be that if someone thought they could get away completely with doing something bad that would benefit them, then they would basically do it, but that social forces keep everyone in line. To be honest with you I'd rather have everyone being nice because they're afraid of being shunned than some random subset of people who are automatically going to try to shaft me for no reason no matter what."
2099_A,t1_ccofru6_3,marlow41,"I guess what I'm saying is I agree with your worldview, but I disagree that it constitutes selfishness on the part of people practicing kind acts. Doing nice, generous things because you want to be seen as a good person, or because you actually are a good person: it doesn't really matter you're still doing nice things and that's unselfish."
2456_A,t3_1hw3be,ispellgoodly,"While I myself am no linguist by any means, I do get a little annoyed when people commit grammatical sacrelige. I usually keep these thoughts to myself.

Other times, when somebody with less-than-perfect language speaks their mind, naysayers quickly draw their swords and lynch the perpetrator regardless of the contents of their argument, valid or not. So people with potentially insightful opinions who are sadly lacking in communication skills are shut down.

I think that's a little silly. Besides, isn't a little rule breaking integral to language evolving? Surely in the hay days of early language people got tired of using two words to say something and instead decided to combine the words -- giving birth to the contraction!

Again, no linguist, just a thought and a little theory."

Inasmuch as creating the impression of credibility is important for someone making an argument, then expressing that argument with correct spelling and grammar is important."
3003_A,t3_320ncw,FoxyMayhem,"My mother is a deeply loving woman who sent me to Logical and Critical thinking classes as a kid. She has spent her life trying to raise children with clear thinking and a strong moral core. I respect her more than almost anyone in the world.

She also nearly had a degree in biology, but had to abandon that due to personal crisis at the time.

However... she is a Young Earth Creationist, believes people shouldn't write books where people talk to fay (elves, whisps, etc) to get magic because then they're teaching people to open themselves to demons. She was very afraid of Harry Potter and ate up the supposed satanist connections.

She says I'm too cold in my logic, and that life's greatest things (love and god, etc) are not measurable. She says I only talk like I do about ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" because I haven't experienced spiritual powers of good and evil. And she casts my walking away from the faith as ""being just part of the natural rebellion phase. People realize they had it right when they were children, and come back to god.""

She counters my arguments advocating skepticism in regards to ""spiritual matters"" by this condescending ""well you just haven't experienced it"" crap. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall, there's no conversation when someone just waves it away with a hand.
And so, I don't think I can make any headway trying to debate her because I feel like she'll just dismiss anything that doesn't line up with her view. ""I'll be so happy when I understand it all"" in heaven, she says when I bring up conflicting elements oft he bible. It's so MAGICAL and MYSTERIOUS, why could our little minds try to understand.

3631_A,t3_3g1fhs,funtomscandy," I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

I've always found them annoying, say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  
  
I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  
  
It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  
  
These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.

***EDIT:***   
  
I had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  
  
The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.
  
My favorite arguments were those along the lines of ""It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent."" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming ""IM BEING OPPRESSED"" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.  A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much.
  
I also learned that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all!

Just a caveat here, there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   
  
I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. **But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby.** These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. **People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.**  
  
One PM I got said:  
  
&gt;I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  
  
He doesn't take the time to think, ""How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?"" No, this person doesn't give a shit.

I was defiantly in a situation where if we replaced my mom with literally any other human on Earth I would have broke their jaw. She'd pin me against a wall and call me a fag and hit me and hurt me, and I'd take it. Every. Last. Hit. The only thing that every stopped me was knowing I wasn't allowed to.

Because of some fucked up child memories, to this day I still can't take a photo of myself without breaking down or look myself in the eyes or even say i'm ""happy.""

I grew up in a similar situation to the one you described, with an alcoholic, physically and verbally abusive father between the ages of 10 and 18. It wasn't until I got a little bigger around 16 that I started hitting back, eventually leading to more serious physical altercations between him and I when I was 18, with our last big fight being the last time I've spoken to him (I'm 26 now)."

Could this stem from a system that's still reinforced today by biased housing practices? And then does this not tie back to the original idea of black lives not being treated equally?

d70wlrd,d71239b_1,Oliver5366,"That's an excellent way to become racist and hateful. If you disregard any argument someone makes because they hurt your feelings, it's going to make it a lot harder for you to ever self-improve. And if you just take it as an immutable given that you aren't racist--no mater what argument someone makes to the contrary--then it makes it a lot more likely you'll start doing racist things without noticing."
d70wlrd,d71239b_2,Oliver5366,"What's more, you're thinking of racist as an insult. It's not. It's a *criticism*. It's not meant to make you feel bad or look bad. It's meant to show you a flaw in your thought process, that you can then seek to fix. When someone calls you a racist, your first thought should not be, ""I am not a racist, thus this person is wrong, thus I will ignore this person"". It should instead be to consider the possibility that you are racist so that, if you are, you can improve in the future. And if you aren't, that doesn't mean anything *else* the person said is necessarily wrong."

dal8h6d,dal916e,RandomWriterGuy,But it means it won't be welcoming either. In fact most people don't recommend Reddit because of the horrible content they don't want to expose to them.
dal8h6d,dal9dnh,championofobscurity,"Inclusivity is an arbitrary metric though. Currently Reddit is fully functional with its userbase.

There is nothing lost by their absence the amount of content on Reddit already is already in the excess of consumption possible over the course of a human life.

dms5nak,dms5nak_1,neofederalist,"Table the DACA argument for a little bit, I want to focus on the first part. For right wing support of the coal industry to be hypocritical, the type of government action that they are proposing to help it must be categorically similar to the kind of government action that they're opposing in other areas."
dms5nak,dms5nak_2,neofederalist,"Why have coal industry jobs disappeared? Well there are a number of reasons. You're partially right about technological progress. There is less of a demand for coal because natural gas and renewable energy is often cheaper. Also, as is the case with nonrenewable resources, coal mining in the Appalachia is getting more expensive because the easy to get coal has already been mined. However, there is another factor that is contributing to loss of jobs in the coal industry in a negligible way: new governmental regulations. If jobs have been lost in an industry because of artificial restraints placed on them by the government, then it's not inconsistent with free-market principles to advocate for getting rid of those regulations."
dms5nak,dms5nak_3,neofederalist,"The big one is the [Clean Power Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Power_Plan). In President Obama's [own words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqHL404zhcU), this kind of regulation by definition hurts the coal industry. Increasing jobs through eliminating costly regulations seems to be well within the kinds of things that Republicans like to see."
dms5nak,dmsc1yj_1,namename77,"&gt;If jobs have been lost in an industry because of artificial restraints placed on them by the government, then it's not inconsistent with free-market principles to advocate for getting rid of those regulations.
I can see where this point comes from. It's not inconsistent with conservative POVs to support getting rid of regulations at all. I guess my view is more philosophical, though--why is there any motivation at all from the right to provide a helping hand in other people getting jobs? Isn't that people's own business?"
dms5nak,dmsc1yj_2,namename77,"Those regulations were passed for environmental reasons; they affect the market, but so do a lot of things. Why should the government spend time, effort, and money repealing those regulations to help a few people who should be capable and motivated enough to go out and get another job once theirs disappears for good, environmental reasons?"
dms5nak,dmsch6y_1,StanguardRL,"&gt; I guess my view is more philosophical, though--why is there any motivation at all from the right to provide a helping hand in other people getting jobs? Isn't that people's own business?
I think the difference is helping vs. not hurting."
dms5nak,dmsch6y_2,StanguardRL,"Giving people welfare and things like that is actively ""helping"" these people, while getting rid of restrictive regulations is ceasing to ""hurt"" people."
dms5nak,dmsd15r_1,namename77,"That's fair enough. This line of reasoning definitely makes the most headway in reconciling these two ways of thinking.
I'm just stuck on the fact that that ""not hurting"" philosophy isn't represented across the board in conservatism. There are lots of laws in place that prevent certain people from getting jobs (immigrants, legal and otherwise), but republicans aren't in favor of repealing those to ""stop hurting."""
dms5nak,dmsfdv9,Cooldude638,"Republicans favor those laws because they believe that immigrants getting (taking) is hurting Americans. Ergo, stop immigrants, stop the hurting."
dms5nak,dmsfj8c,namename77,So why do we pity people who lose their jobs to immigrants? 
dms5nak,dmsr71u_1,Earthling03,"We don't pity them, we just think that Americans should be held in higher regard than non-citizens.
I used to manage hundreds of properties. I had a long list of cleaners, painters, landscapers, etc. They were all American, family run businesses with 5-20ish employees and everyone spoke English (lots of black families in my list, btw). They had insurance and paid their taxes and lots of these guys supported families. They're ALL out of business because they couldn't compete with illegal immigrants who don't pay employee taxes because they pay their guys under the table. You cannot compete against companies that don't care about playing by the rules."
dms5nak,dmsr71u_2,Earthling03,Do you pity all the Americans who have lost their businesses and their jobs? Do you really think that Mexican citizens are more deserving of those jobs in the US than US citizens?
dms5nak,dmsrstj,namename77,"No, I think they're equally deserving. I think those people should be given a clear pathway to citizenship--I.e., we should make citizenship more accessible to more people--so they can work legally for a fair wage. And I think we should more heavily punish those who pay under the table vs punishing those who recieve payment under the table. "
dms5nak,dmt3dsr,Earthling03,"Why? Americans who were raised here and who have paid taxes for their whole lives are losing their livelyhood so people who are loyal to another country can send money there instead of keeping it in our economy. I'm loyal to my fellow citizens and can't stand watching black communities, especially, take the brunt of the economic hit. "
dms5nak,dmt84qb_1,namename77,Taking a hard line here: if you're a good worker you won't lose your job to immigrants. Be willing to work harder to get promoted or more often or for less. Don't be like one of those people who take welfare money because they lost their job to a situation outside their control; be a good American and find a job no matter what.
dms5nak,dmt84qb_2,namename77,"As for the argument regarding their contribution to the economy: Illegal immigrants as they are now don't contribute as much in terms of the spending economy (which would change if they were given amnesty), but they contribute a hell of a lot to the production economy. Without illegal immigrants that lemon you bought at the grocery store for 75 cents would cost like 5 bucks, or might not even *be* in your store depending on where you live. Illegal immigrants are helping a country they don't belong to every day by working in its economy without any of the safety nets afforded to workers. Why don't they deserve a chance to get some of the safety when they prop us and our way of life up?"
dms5nak,dmtf2co_1,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,"Wow how can you not see that the rich benefitted from illegal workers (cutting prices like you say), in the same way the rich benefitted from slavery.
Is it surprising the rich are selling a narrative that it's better to keep things as they are? It should be almost telling that rich Democrats suddenly find a reason to be so concerned about illegal immigrants lol"
dms5nak,dmtf2co_2,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,"How about giving those human beings a chance to be legal Americans and have legal safety nets and the support of the entire country?
It's almost insulting you think we would take pride that most illegal immigrants we know are working under the table. Yeah we should be so proud that our relatives are propping up your society by making your fruits cheaper as they struggle to pull themselves up at those wages you deem fit. (as long as no coal worker says anything mean or true about it)"
dms5nak,dmtf2co_3,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,"Illegal immigration has led to a lot more than cheap fruit. And if that's the peak of alien achievement then maybe it's time we try to make people citizens, instead of indentured servants."
dugbpox,dugbpox,verfmeer,"&gt; No legislation which could be enacted could have prevented what occurred, or what could occur in the future.

Why do you think this is true?"
dugbpox,dugccj9_1,EmElJee,"I believe this is true because laws will not prevent bad people from doing bad things. Someone with enough motivation will overcome these laws. Additionally, the argument that a specific legislation may reduce the occurrences of these tragedies are hard to quantify and I believe are not worth sacrificing our rights for."

dugbpox,dugde0j_1,EmElJee,"The scope of that question is a bit broad, do you mean all laws? Or laws regarding firearms? I think the answer varies depending on what you mean.
That being said, we have the strict laws against murder, and murder still happens. Do you think even stricter laws would have been a deterrent against the recent tragedies? I'm not suggesting we repeal laws against murder because that law does not prevent them, but rather suggesting that we already have strong deterrents against these events, and additional legislation would not help further."
dugbpox,dugdgtw,VernonHines,"&gt;  The scope of that question is a bit broad, do you mean all laws?

Exactly.  If laws do not prevent crime, then why have laws?"
dugbpox,dugduse_1,EmElJee,"Here is how I see it
* Laws deter crime.
* We already have laws against what occurred in recent tragedies.
* Increasing the penalties or number of laws broken will not increase it's ability to act as a deterrent against the events which took place.
* Therefore, I do not see additional gun control measures as being appropriate."
dugbpox,dugikhf,TybaltTyburn,"So if gun control laws were shown to deter the usage of guns in major crimes, you're saying you'd be down with gun control laws, correct?

For the record, I'm a three-gun, SASS shooter with a CCW."
dugbpox,dugjmmc,EmElJee,"It really depends on the legislation at that point, how are my rights being respected? If my rights are being discarded to reduce the occurrence of an already extremely rare event, it does not seem worth it to me."
dugbpox,dugjs0n_1,TybaltTyburn,"But that's not what you said and heavily implied in the response.
So either the rule of law and reduction in harm is important to you, or it isn't.
Your approval is contingent on your subjective impression of whether your ""rights"" are being infringed or not, regardless of whether or not those ""rights"" are actually privileges conferred by the rule of law in the nation of your residence."
dugbpox,dugjs0n_2,TybaltTyburn,"Is that correct?
I am asking for clarification, because you are citing nebulous ""rights"" that you have not defined or clarified.
Your CCW and mine are privileges that can be revoked if we commit felonies or other crimes - not rights. Your right to own a firearm can be revoked for the same reason."
dugbpox,dugjs0n_3,TybaltTyburn,"A right, by definition, cannot be revoked for any reason under a rule of law.
For example, you have the right to an attorney if arrested. If you can't afford one, you get an attorney who is likely to be an overworked public defender - but you get one.
So either you believe in the rule of law as it pertains to society, or you believe in the mandate of individuals over society and the laws enacted to prevent the crime you are citing the need to carry a weapon to defend against."
dugbpox,dugjs0n_4,TybaltTyburn,Which is an awfully circuitous chain of logic that cancels itself out.
dugbpox,dugle07_1,EmElJee,"I'll try to clarify:
We have a right to purchase and keep for self defense modern semi-automatic firearms in the home. This is what I believe the courts have granted us by citing the second amendment.
I believe we have some level of rights that we must be able to exercise this right by being able to purchase modern semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines without significant restrictions and bureaucracy."
dugbpox,dugle07_2,EmElJee,"I am not talking about CCW, as it is not considered a right. I am interested in if there are laws that exist that can allow me to own modern firearms, not significantly violate any of my rights, and would actually be effective in stopping these kinds of attacks.

Lawyers often do some of their training for free, while putting in equally long hours. Aspiring actors work on crappy sets, take uncomfortable roles, and so on.

The way he was talking makes it seem like all male idols go in at **29** and come out at 32, but that's just an anecdote (like much of what he said in that video). The situation he's describing is someone who decided to enlist at 29 and enter a field of service that is longer than 24 months and happened to have a birthday soon after he enlisted."
e0vo60j,e0w6irf_2,tastetherainbeau,"Prince Mak is an Australian citizen and does not have to serve so that may be why his numbers are a bit off.
But I think the sentiment is still correct. If men are still idols by the time they are ~29 (most are no longer idols by that age due to most groups disbanding by then), they have to serve and when they return, they don't have a safety net to return to if their group disbanded in that time. So it's true that military service is a factor that can put a damper on the success of an artist."

Getting a label of mental illness is sure to attach this sort of bias to you, causing great harm. In a worst case, students can even be separated from general population, or singled out for punishment on the basis of such labels. 

My father still describes how one of his early girlfriend's family sent her to a psychologist to convince her that he was ""sent by the devil to tempt her"" and thus convince her not to pursue  any sort of relationship with him. We can also see how Soviet dissenters were labeled as 'insane' and made to go through psychological treatment to correct their errant viewpoints. Even today, in the west, the field seems to lean in favor of authoritarian ideologies. Given the subjective nature of the field, I have reason to worry about being diagnosed as mentally ill on the basis of my political ideology alone.

1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_1,Umdrehung,"Mental Health Professional here (graduating in May).  Let me address a few points:
First, you sound like you’re quite skeptical about therapy in general – it absolutely has the potential to make things worse (which is important to warn clients about), but this is not unlike many medical treatments that cause as much harm as good.  The vast majority of clients do improve, or, at worst, show no improvement.  Very few become markedly worse, and there are enormous studies showing this phenomena (with thousands of participants over many years – look for anything by Lambert, Strupp, or Crits-Christoph if interested).  Therapy works for most people, but it does not work for everyone.  If treatment has to work for everyone who tries it, you need to become equally outraged at the medical field as well."
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_2,Umdrehung,"Also, it’s worth pointing out that the Rosenhan experiment does NOT show what you claim it does, and it is unfair to assume that it is representative of how commitment processes work.  Professionally, it would never occur to me that someone showing up at an inpatient psychiatric hospital requesting treatment would be “faking it”, and I imagine the people that worked there probably had similar thoughts."
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_3,Umdrehung,"Second, your assertion that “And that it only takes the word of a psychologist to cause such a hold,” is outright wrong.  Here’s a blurb from Wikipedia:
&gt;In 1978, the Addington v. Texas set the bar for involuntary commitment for treatment by raising the burden of proof required to commit persons from the usual civil burden of proof of ""preponderance of the evidence"" to the higher standard of ""clear and convincing"" evidence.[24]
&gt;An example of involuntary commitment procedures is the Baker Act used in Florida. Under this law, a person may be committed only if they present a danger to themselves or others.
I have committed people before, and the rules about this process are universal as far as I know.  You seem to be under the impression that I can just snap my fingers and the person will be held for for 72 hours (or indefinitely).  The reality is that you need clear and convicing evidence that someone is a harm to themselves and others, and there are specific criteria for that, which involves a clinical interview (remember P.I.M.P - Previous attempts, Ideations, Means, Plan).  You must meet these criteria (not necessarily all 4, but usually the ‘IMP’ part) in order to even get a 72-hour hold.  In those 72-hours, TWO different professionals formally evaluate the person, in addition to the other staff and professionals who may offer their observations to the psychiatrist.  The psychiatrists will often follow up with family/friends (assuming the individual grants permission) in order to get information from as many sources as possible.  In the counties around me, I don’t even get to make the decision really – the hospitals all have a crisis intervention team who actually evaluates the person when they show up to the hospital (before they are ever committed).  They will take my opinion into account, but I have little say in whether or not the hospital agrees that they are dangerous enough to stay.  I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard of people getting to the hospital, regaining some control/composure/having the feelings pass, and then being sent home."
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_4,Umdrehung,"As well, there are also other oversights in place, including: legal, insurance, the hospital, the county, and any other collaterals/stakeholders who may be involved in the person’s treatment.  You also don’t seem to appreciate how much time and paperwork this process takes – searching for a bed at a psych hospital can take days of waiting, and you have 25-30 other clients to see that week.  In a previous job, I used to have to sit iwht my clients until they were placed.  I imagine the number of therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists who go out of their way to commit people out of malice or spite is very close to 0."
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_5,Umdrehung,"In my experience, and those of the colleagues I’ve worked with, it is incredibly hard to have someone committed, even when you know they are dangerous.  The burden of proof and the process are so extremely difficult that, as a professional, you do whatever you have to in order to avoid going down that road."
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_6,Umdrehung,"To address your other points (the last two paragraphs seems tangential, anecdotal, and unrelated to the first two paragraphs), it is extremely uncommon that people have weapons taken from them due to mental health treatment.  I work for the military and have to sign off on various forms when people are up for reviews, physicals, clearances, etc.  I have not had to say “no” to anyone because they were seeing me, and even if I do, it is not an automatic “game over” for them.  These same people are on anti-depressants, anxiety medications, etc.  All of this is true of the pilots I have seen as well.  Often mental health seems to get the blame when people do not qualify for something (“they must have turned me down because I saw a therapist a few years back” – virtually never the only reason)."
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_7,Umdrehung,"The only time people’s weapons do get taken away (that I have experienced) are when there are clear dangers (suicide/homicide, as outlined above) or domestic violence situations that have a high likelihood of resulting in a fatality.  But after things have been reconciled (or, as is more often the case, the spouses separate), they are returned.  I don’t have a giant safe in my office full of confiscated weaponry."
1582_A,t1_cfpb5e7_8,Umdrehung,"As others have pointed out, the links you provided are anecdotal – like any profession, we have idiots who over-step their bounds, and there are horror stories.  Mental health treatment helps hundreds of thousands of people every year, and there are a small minority who do not benefit from treatment and actually get worse.  But you can’t make sweeping generalizations about an entire field because of some extremely uncommon incidents."
1582_A,t1_cfq8or5_1,username_6916,"&gt;First, you sound like you’re quite skeptical about therapy in general – it absolutely has the potential to make things worse (which is important to warn clients about), but this is not unlike many medical treatments that cause as much harm as good.

Therapy works for most people, but it does not work for everyone. If treatment has to work for everyone who tries it, you need to become equally outraged at the medical field as well.
The big difference is patient consent. If I specifically do not want some medical treatment or find it harmful, I have a well established right to refuse. In my own experiences with the school system (going all he way from primary school to dealing with my university), I think I experienced a fair bit of coercion regarding this."
1582_A,t1_cfq8or5_2,username_6916,"&gt; Also, it’s worth pointing out that the Rosenhan experiment does NOT show what you claim it does, and it is unfair to assume that it is representative of how commitment processes work. Professionally, it would never occur to me that someone showing up at an inpatient psychiatric hospital requesting treatment would be “faking it”, and I imagine the people that worked there probably had similar thoughts.
Part of my fear is that someone will attempt to use the commitment process maliciously. They will lie and conspire with someone in the mental health field to get someone else admitted against their will."
1582_A,t1_cfq8or5_3,username_6916,"If I'm accused of a crime, I can have a lawyer almost immediately, I can get a (hypothetically) impartial hearing and can testify or choose not to testify in my own defense. I'm not sure the same thing can be said of being committed, even with the additional safeguards you describe, has the same level of these protections."
1582_A,t1_cfq8or5_4,username_6916,"Given the short and long term consequences of getting it wrong, this is something that has to stand up to a determined attacker. It's not enough to simply say that no professional would ever try because their ethics prohibit it.
&gt; The only time people’s weapons do get taken away (that I have experienced) are when there are clear dangers (suicide/homicide, as outlined above) or domestic violence situations that have a high likelihood of resulting in a fatality. But after things have been reconciled (or, as is more often the case, the spouses separate), they are returned. I don’t have a giant safe in my office full of confiscated weaponry.
Of course you don't. It's not your job to enforce a list of prohibited persons."
1582_A,t1_cfq8or5_5,username_6916,"In California, being the subject to even a 72 hour hold makes you a prohibited person for the next 5 years. That's a serious, long-term loss of civil rights in my view."
1786_B,t3_1ut0dy,FlyingChainsaw,"**Currently, every single human being lives either on, or in orbit of, the planet Earth**. This means that a single global disaster large enough could wipe out our entire species.  
Now I'm not saying that this is going to happen anywhere in the following 1000 years or indeed anytime soon, but considering the fact that the planet has already seen five mass-extinction events, it is very likely (and I would like to say inevitable) that something along these lines is going to happen again someday or another.

The odds of another asteroid like the one from the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction might be quite low on the short term, but high in the long run. And we should remember that it carries a risk so incredibly high (i.e. the extinction of the entirety of our species) that we should, at the very least, *start* research on making sure not all of ours eggs are in one basket.  
And of course, that's not the only danger: extreme climate changes and thermonuclear wars are just two examples of things that could completely fuck each and every one of us over.  
It doesn't matter if it happens tomorrow or in a hundred thousand years (not to mention the lack of resources in 100k years): the chances of, *eventually*, something happening to the planet that will cause another mass extinction event are pretty much 1.

Colonizing other planets would spread this risk, and quite probably not just to two planets. Because if we have the technology to live independently on other planets, why stop at two? But even if we stopped at just two as a maximum amount of planets, the odds of survival increase tremendously. After all, mass extinction events aren't exactly so common that they would occur on both planets at once.

I believe the reason for an organism to exist, is to help ensure the survival of its species, and that by not researching heavily into something that will, quite probably,  save the entirety of the species, we are neglecting the sole reason of our collective existences.

EDIT: Apparently this didn't really come across in my initial post, but I'm talking about a time span of several hundred years, I'm not saying we should have a colony on Mars by next Wednesday. I'm saying we should start focusing on research for interstellar travel now, so that by, say, 2500, we have the technology to colonize other habitable planets (although the sooner the better, of course)."
1786_B,t1_celg0sb_1,KuulGryphun,"I agree with the basic premise of your post.  What I am going to attempt to CYV on is the urgency you express in your statement ""greatly focus on funding this.""
Over just the last few centuries, technology has advanced incredibly quickly.  Imagine how much more technology will advance in the next few?"
1786_B,t1_celg0sb_2,KuulGryphun,"When the space shuttle was retired just a couple years back, its computer systems were all incredibly outdated, even though they were first constructed in the 1980's.  The whole line of space shuttles had outlived its useful lifespan in only 20 or 30 years because it would have been prohibitively expensive to upgrade them to modern standards."
1786_B,t1_celg0sb_3,KuulGryphun,"Now, when the space shuttle was initially designed and constructed it was the epitome of technology.  The U.S. government spent billions of dollars on the space shuttle program - most of the money that the U.S. spent on any kind of space program was spent on the space shuttle.  All that money has essentially been obsoleted by newer space programs (in particular, the private space company SpaceX)."
1786_B,t1_celg0sb_4,KuulGryphun,"What if, instead, we waited for technology to advance to the point where space travel was easy?  Where building self-reliant habitats was easy?  You can argue that for these technologies to advance we have to start pushing space programs now, but I say using stepping-stone programs to advance the technology (and sometimes even getting private industry to do it instead, ala SpaceX) is a much more efficient method of reaching your goal than saying ""Ok, buckle down everyone, we're building a colony on Europa in 10 years!""."
1786_B,t1_celg0sb_5,KuulGryphun,"I believe, if we were to pour buckets of money into a space program again, whose purpose was colonizing other planets and/or moons, it simply wouldn't give us as much bang for our buck as if we wait for technology to develop to a point where it is both easier and more economical to build such a program.  And with the rate that technology is advancing, that point can't be far off (especially on geological/astronomical timescales)."
1786_B,t1_celg0sb_6,KuulGryphun,"TL;DR: Sometimes things just take time to develop, and throwing as much money as it as you can right now (""greatly focus on funding"") is not the most efficient way to do it."
1786_B,t1_celllem_1,FlyingChainsaw,"True. I suppose you're right about technology 'getting there eventually', but wouldn't you say increased funding for the NASA/ESA increases the speed with which the necessary technology is invented?
And not funding for shuttle X, but funding for separate technologies, which would be considerably cheaper and efficient (since these new technologies would become platforms for even newer ones, and building *just* single components is much cheaper than entire shuttles)."
1786_B,t1_celoret_1,KuulGryphun,"You are mostly agreeing with a point I already argued in my post:
&gt; You can argue that for these technologies to advance we have to start pushing space programs now, but I say using stepping-stone programs to advance the technology (and sometimes even getting private industry to do it instead, ala SpaceX) is a much more efficient method of reaching your goal than saying ""Ok, buckle down everyone, we're building a colony on Europa in 10 years!"".
I feel this is different from what you were proposing in your OP, which was to ""greatly focus on funding"" a colonial space program."
1786_B,t1_celq0l4,FlyingChainsaw,"I suppose my wording in the OP were worded somewhat unfortunately - reading it again, it does sound like I was suggesting we get an entire colony up and running ASAP.  
I guess I'll have to try again in a few months and word it more accurately"
1786_B,t1_celqez5_1,KuulGryphun,"If your real view was as you put in your OP, I think I deserve a delta =P
If your real view was as you are suggesting now (agreeing with my stepping stone process), then I say that this is already in effect.
SpaceX can launch a rocket to deliver a payload to the International Space Station.  It plans to develop a vehicle to deliver a payload to Mars soon."
1786_B,t1_celqez5_2,KuulGryphun,"Computer technology continues to advance at a fast pace, fueled mostly by the private sector.  Computers are of course necessary for controlling any sort of modern technology used in a spacecraft/colony.
Solar panel technology continues to advance at a fast pace.  The Sun provides an abundant source of energy for spacecraft currently, and more advanced solar panels could be essential for providing power to a colony on mars.  This is being driven by a combination of private sector demand and government funding."
1786_B,t1_celqez5_3,KuulGryphun,"Hydroponics continues to [advance](http://hydroprosmi.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/some-impressive-advances-in-hydroponics/), and is thought to be a way to grow crops either in spacecraft or in colonies without suitable soil.  This is probably also essential to constructing a self-sustained colony on another world.  It is mostly being funded by government.
Anyway, there are currently many ongoing efforts that all advance our level of space technology, even when they don't really mean to.  They are all small stepping stones that we can use later to build the space colonies we're dreaming of!"
1786_B,t1_celr5jq_1,FlyingChainsaw,"Giving it a thought, I suppose that you did argue against the OP quite well, and did in fact counter some of the points quite nicely to the point where I would agree with them. I'd even go so far as to say it's worthy of a *Victory Triangle™*!
Here you go: &amp;#8710;"
2002_A,t3_1q82wf,blackflag415,"Before I begin, I want to point out a few things that I didn't say.  I didn't say that many Northerns weren't also racist.  I didn't say that every Northerner was fighting to free all the slaves.  I didn't say that Lincoln considered blacks as equal to whites.  What I said was that slavery was the primary cause of the civil war; all the other cause are tied into that one central thread.  Let's look at some of the other causes I've seen cited as leading to the Civil War:

1) SOUTHERN LIFESTYLE - Some say the South was fighting to preserve their way of life.  I don't think anyone was trying to stop them from drinking sweet tea or eating grits.  The aspect of the southern lifestyle that caused war was slavery.  

2) STATES RIGHTS - States rights for what?  I know the South was angry about tarrifs imposed by the North too, but c'mon.  No one in Kansas was killing eachother about tarrifs.

3) ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES - I agree with this one.  The North was an industrialized society, powered by wage labor.  The South was a rural, agricultural society powered by slave labor.  So slavery figures centrally into this one.  

4) BUT MOST WHITE SOUTHERNERS DIDN'T OWN SLAVES - Yes, this is true. But slavery was still important to non-slave owners for two reasons.  One, may thought they would own slaves someday.  Also it was central to the white supremacist racial ideology.  A white Southerner could be completely poor, but at least (in his mind) he wasn't a slave.  

5) BUT MANY NORTHERNERS WERE RACIST TOO - So?  Many Americans were racist during WWII but it doesn't mean that they didn't find Hitler's ideas completely disgusting.  

Anyway those are the main ones I always hear.  Please CMV

EDIT: grammar

EDIT 2: Some people are saying disputing whether I'm talking about the initial sucession or the ensuing war.  Therefore I'll post an updated thesis:

'Slavery was the primary cause of the secession of the Southern States and ensuing outbreak of war between them and the Northern States during the US Civil War.'

Also I retract my point about the apologists, there is no way I can argue about a huge group of people's motivation.  "
2002_A,t1_cda826v_1,zardeh,"I want to comment on a few things, I certainly agree that slavery was a major cause, I don't know if I would consider it the primary cause, maybe, I'm not sure.
So the whole states rights issue was about the ability for states to decided whether slaves could be owned firstly, and later if states had the right to succeed from the union.  I'm going to go ahead and say here that while slavery is/was involved in every issue, it wasn't always at the center, and in some cases was simply a catalyst for other issues.  So while states rights revolved around slavery, that wouldn't have been necessary for the war to occur, the question of ""how much power to nullify do states have"" came to a head at around the same time that there was a push to end slavery, and both were pushed by each other."
2002_A,t1_cda826v_2,zardeh,"Same with economics, while slavery did/could play a huge issue in that, northerners also owned slaves and plantations in the north, so it wasn't simply slave based economy vs. non slave based, it was relatively self sufficient manufacturing and farming (with relatively few slaves) vs. trade based tobacco and cotton harvesting (with relatively many slaves), based economies."
2002_A,t1_cda826v_3,zardeh,"And on that point about racism, as I said, northerners owned slaves, and there were no plans to free those slaves, in fact the emancipation proclamation said nothing about freeing those slaves.  Your comparison breaks down, it would be like the US going to war to fight Hitler's Germany while at the same time establishing concentration camps of its own ^^^except ^^^oh ^^^wait ^^^we ^^^did ^^^that ^^^with ^^^Japanese-Americans ^^^in ^^^WWII."
2002_A,t1_cda826v_4,zardeh,"And that I think is the strongest argument as to why it wasn't mainly about slavery, the end to slavery wasn't going to be in the US, it was going to be in the Recessionary states; and, even if it does seem to you that it was still the major issue, this should throw enough doubt on the issue to show that there is easily room for debate on what the ""true motives"" were."
2002_A,t1_cda826v_5,zardeh,"Was slavery bad?  Hell yes.  Was it a major issue regarding the Civil war?  Hell yes.  Was it the major issue?  Maybe, possibly.  Is anyone who disagrees with that sentiment an apologist?  No.
I think another way to put it, much more succinctly is this:  The south was fighting for their right to continue to use slaves.  The north was fighting to keep the south around, no matter their plans."
2002_A,t1_cda8etj_1,blackflag415,"Thank you for your long and thoughtful post.
I'm sorry, but those arguing for the South going to war/seceding about states rights have a lot of hypocracy answer for.  Where was the states rights in the Fugitive Slave Act for example?

The traveller [tweeted the incident with a photo](https://twitter.com/aaronpp/status/389191057746841600/photo/1), calling it disgusting, and lots of people chimed in, using terms like ""disgusting"", ""unforgivable"", ""disgraceful"", ""abhorrent behaviour"" and so on.

I expect that if the baggage handler in question had written ""I'm an aborigine"" or ""I am a black person"" on the luggage, the owner would have probably just shrugged, gone ""no, I'm not actually"" and nobody would have made much of a fuss about it. 

The fact that everyone is getting their knickers in a twist about it tells me that the commenters in question are latently homophobic. It's only an ""unforgivable slur"" if you think being gay is a detestable thing.

I expect that there may be a different explanation for all the outrage, but I can't think what it is. To me it all seems like closet homophobia in all those oh-so-enlightened and tolerant commenters.

2087_A,t1_ccrhx5q_1,reddittroll111,"I believe that sexual identification is ""deeper"" (no pun intended) than racial or ethnic identity.
For instance, I am American. It is because of where I was born and defines me to some extent but I can choose that extent. I would be annoyed or confused if someone called me British but being American is not a fundamental part of my innermost identity as a person, not a member of society."
2087_A,t1_ccrhx5q_2,reddittroll111,"However being straight is a large part of my identity. I think about it when I wake up, when I see men, when I look at girls and when I go to sleep. It is fundamental to who I am, so asserting that I am not heterosexual is thus a more pertinent and important issue. Not only that but like many straight people I find the concept of gay sex abhorrent. This doesn't mean I have in irresistable urge to stab any gay person I meet but I would not watch and being forced to take part would be a form of mild to moderate torture. I don't want anyone confusing me with a person who would enjoy that"

You can tell if someone is a man or a woman by looking at them and deduce their race pretty quickly by looking at them too.

2374_A,t3_1j8dv1,jmpaiva,"I state this because I think movies in general are made/released in the context of their time and that people who see them decades in the future might not really understand them or their importance/quality.

I can give 2 examples: some years ago I saw Citizen kane for the first time, I understand as a movie being realeased in the time of musicals and westerns it must have been an amazing breath of fresh air, but decades away it's looks to me just as an ok movie, so I refrained from rating as it would be unfair to give it a relativelly slow rating.

Another example was the blues brothers: saw it weeks ago and thought it was mainly boring and childish, after seeing the reviews (and trying to understand the high rating) I realized at it's time with those actors, those cameos it must have been something great, just not from my actual point of view...
(this could probably be said about most movies of the 80s)

No one today is in that time back then, so it's inaccurate. And there are a lot of movies from years ago that are still good today despite context. Casablanca is old as fuck (1930s I think) and it's still praised for its story. The Matrix (I know it's only like 10 years old) at the time it came out  blew everyone's mind cause it had all these special effects that no one has seen before. Today they're just meh, because of the advancement of technology but everyone stills thinks the effects are cool and the story is awesome."
2723_B,t3_1d93tu,Kwyjibo08,"(This is in regards to the US. I can't speak for other countries.)

I'll have to begin by answering the obvious problem of critiquing the performance of teachers. Alongside this performance-based pay, would be the removal of student assessment by teachers. Typical daily assignments would be graded by the teachers, but tests would be administered and graded by a third party. This would create an unbiased view of student achievement which teachers would then be reviewed against. The better the grades students get, the more the teacher gets paid.

The current structure of teachers' performance reviews and pay is severely broken. Pay is based solely on seniority and not ability. Reviews are done by administration, and I've heard first hand that it is more to a teacher's benefit to be on good terms with the principal for a good review than it is to actually be doing a good job.

I'm tired of our schools doing an inadequate job of educating people, and teachers having no incentive to do a good job.

So, please, CMV and tell me why the status quo is an acceptable approach to education.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the thoughtful discussion. I have to step away from this thread for a little while, and get some other things done. I'll return to it later, probably tomorrow. I think everyone can agree there are problems with the status quo, but there is no easy solution. If there's anyone I haven't addressed, I'll try to get to it tomorrow."
2723_B,t1_c9o543i_1,HiroariStrangebird,"Schools have been assessing teacher performance purely on their students' performance on standardized tests more and more of late, especially with No Child Left Behind. However, I have not met a *single* teacher who thinks this is a good thing, and I know a lot of teachers considering my mom is one, and I know a lot of her co-workers and such. This isn't because they're afraid their poor teaching skills would be outed; in fact, the school she teaches at is one of the best in the state, and the teachers there are wonderful. It's because boiling down something as personal and non-standardizable as teaching kids to the best of your ability in the way they learn the most, into just how well they do on one test, is just not a good idea, nor is it effective. It rewards teaching to the test, just pure ""learn these facts and then put them on the exam,"" to the detriment of everything else that a student should be learning in the classroom. (Critical thinking, healthy curiosity, a sense of wonder at the world and all the subjects in it.) Too, it can punish a teacher for something out of their control - sometimes kids are simply unwilling or unable to perform as well as the state standardized tests expect them to, and often there's no good answer to that."

That letter is painful for me to read, in part because I know it's entirely true."
2723_B,t1_c9per7z,Kwyjibo08,"∆ I can see what you're getting at, and your views, along with this entire thread, has allowed me to see flaws in my ideas. "
2803_B,t3_1bjaaz,Slaughtermatic,"Okay, so here's my understanding of the issue. Everybody is born either male or female, and this is your sex, but whether you are a man or a woman is a an issue of identity, and is independent of your sex. 

That is, one can be born a male, but later on in her life, realize that she identifies with women and women traits, and thus decide to identify as a woman. She would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns, start wearing girl clothes, practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine, may or may not get genital/chest surgery and/or hormones, and then, she would be a girl, and do girl things.

Here is where I have the problem. What are ""Girl traits""? What are ""Girl things""? 

I have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and non-discrimination. I dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race, orientation, etc., and as such, **I don't consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine**. And I think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits are.

When did we decide what traits are? What is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl? Or a boy for that matter? What, if you're...sensitive or something, then you're a girl? I'm a pretty sensitive guy! And I can tell you, there's ALL SORTS of things that I do that other people would consider ""Girly"". But the thing is, I think people are full of bullshit. I mean, I don't really *care*. If people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns, I would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldn't correct them. 

It's just, I don't get it. To me, assigning certain traits to a gender, and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seems...backwards. It seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles. Like, if you're a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresses...well, wearing dresses doesn't really help you identify as a girl, does it? All you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl. All wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look. That's not about how you perceive yourself, it's about how you want society to perceive *you*.

Like, when you tell me you're a girl...well, great, I just learned nothing significant about you at all. That doesn't give me room to presume anything about you, it gives me no information. So why is it such an important identity to so many people? "
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_1,sociable-sociopath,"You're generally right—it is stereotyping to assume that someone is of a certain gender based on what activities they enjoy and it isn't accurate. However, that isn't really how it works.
I'm a trans guy and I like a lot of different things: a lot are 'masculine dudebro' things and a lot aren't. In the course of a single day I can spend hours playing video games, reading or watching shitty TV shows ranging from Pawn Stars to Hannah Montana. I don't regard any of these things as 'female' parts of me. I am inherently male. There is not other way to describe it; it is just who I am. I know that I am a man the same way that I know that I am attracted to women or anything else intuitive. It's absolutely integral to my identity."
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_2,sociable-sociopath,"If I were to put on a dress it wouldn't tap into some female part of me because of some ridiculous notion of gender roles, I would just be a really uncomfortable man in a dress. On to your point about how we are perceived in society: you have never known societal discomfort until you have lived a day with Gender Dysphoria. Hearing 'ma'am' or 'miss' all day every day is the kind of thing that can just make you want to lay down and die as a transgender person."
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_3,sociable-sociopath,It may seem shallow and unnecessary to pander to what society expects of us but there are two reasons for it: one is that stereotypes are absolutely based in fact—they are really just a variation on what psychologists call 'schemas' or really quick bullet points about something that your brain can pull out at the mention of a word. Basically all those little pictures we get in our mind when someone says 'little old lady' or 'Scotsman'. The reason these exist is that they are based on truth and are your brain's way of saving a bit of time because memorising each individual aspect of each individual little old lady or Scotsman you meet is a daunting task.
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_4,sociable-sociopath,"These are only detrimental if we grow to rely on them too much and don't allow them to adapt or expect everyone to fit accurately into our schema which will accurately describe only a handful of people. So basically gender roles are a schema: girls do this, boys do that. My little notecards in my noggin say so—and they are absolutely accurate as a *generalisation* which is why you will find that many trans people do fit these stereotypes of their true gender well. Some things fit people and others don't but as a whole we don't do a half bad job of distinguishing girls and boys (assuming we don't argue that these ideas are set in stone). Equally, there are people on the absolute opposite end of the spectrum: outliers who don't fit into any of their gender's roles. This doesn't make their dysphoria and need to transition any less valid."
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_5,sociable-sociopath,"If you can't tell from my previous points, I strongly disagree with the war on gender roles: used correctly there is absolutely nothing wrong with them (they should, of course, never be forced on someone against their will). They exist for a reason, that reason being that they are fairly prevalent and our brain has decided 'Aha, I should file that!' However, that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge spectrum in between. It's just a basic starting point for what our brain associates with men and women."
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_6,sociable-sociopath,"The second reason is that, for our emotional well-being, us trans folks absolutely *need* to be gendered correctly. It is pivotal to our survival. As such, there is a huge need to 'pass' within the trans community: the easiest way to do this is to dress and act ways that are typical of the gender they want to be seen as. It is a sad fact that people make brash judgments based on what we wear and how we present ourselves; however, getting the average person who has never thought about gender in their life to consider that gender is really on the inside and not the outside is going to be a long and hard battle. As such, it is just easier to conform (and realistically it is not viable for a trans man wearing make up and showing their breasts to be seen as male to the general population—whether it should be or not is controversial even within the trans community)."
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_7,sociable-sociopath,"So basically, in my opinion, it is not that a person who fits female stereotypes *must* be a woman or that a person who fits male stereotypes *must* be a man: it is that these people are women/men and as such align with some (but generally not all) of the tropes of their gender because they are rooted, to some extent, in truth."
2803_B,t1_c977sxm_8,sociable-sociopath,"I hope this is somewhat useful to you—I'm running on no sleep so if there's anything convoluted you want me to clarify or you want me to answer other, more specific questions, then go right ahead!
Edit: Typo fixes."
2803_B,t1_c97cr5m,Slaughtermatic,"∆ Okay, in that case, I suppose it doesn't have to promote stereotypes/roles if you think of them that way. After this, I suppose I no longer *dislike* the concept, but now I feel like I understand it even less. I still want to know why transgendered people feel a need to be gendered ""Correctly"". You are still not telling me what it is about a trans person that makes them either gender. Or a cis person, for that matter. To say that is something that simply *is*, with no actual logic behind it, doesn't make sense to me. "
2876_A,t3_34mjz7,daftmunk,"I hope I'm not being too confusing. I have problems with arguments that I hear for both moral absolutism and moral relativism; I side with relativism for my own reasons.

On the side of moral absolutism, I hear a lot of emotional arguments based on the arguers' fear and moral outrage. Of course, that isn't rational. Sometimes, they'll point to God, but even if I believed in God, how would his moral beliefs not be preferences rather than facts? Other times, they'll say that all human societies agree on at least some things, but consensus can't make something true. The entire human species could believe that the earth is flat, but it would still be round.

In favor of moral relativism, people argue that not all societies have the same moral standards. I personally find it hard to believe that all societies don't agree at least on some things, but regardless, this argument still supports the irrational notion that consensus can make something true. Many moral relativists also believe that we shouldn't judge the behaviors of other societies, which makes no sense to me. Why not judge societies just because they have different moral standards? We already judge individuals who have different standards. Are international matters a no-thinking zone?

I believe that morality is relative because it is not completely logical. I can prove to you that 3 + 4 = 7 with marbles. I can prove to you that there's a moon by pointing at it. I can prove to you that ""was it a car or a cat I saw"" is a palindrome by having you read it backwards.

Morality doesn't work like this; it builds off of emotionally-based premises such as ""life is precious"" or ""pain is bad."" Even if there was a god, his or her morality wouldn't be factual. 

Moral values are preferences rather than facts. No amount of anxiety or rage can make something a fact. If moral values cannot be facts, then how can morality be absolute?

2876_A,t1_cqw297k_1,gbdallin,"You're missing a part. Morality wasn't created by either of those premises.
My argument is that morality is based on empathy, which is not a humans-only process. If you look at it that way, morality is simply the attempt to treat people the way you think they want to be treated. You could be wrong, guessing what they want. But, it's the intent at that point."
2876_A,t1_cqw2ssd_1,daftmunk,"There are different types of morality, though.  There are sociopaths who have their own morals that have nothing to do with empathy.  Even empathetic people have morals that aren't based on empathy.  For example, many people think that flag-burning is wrong even though flags don't have feelings.  Others believe that it's wrong to challenge authority, and some people will call something morally wrong just because it grosses them out."
2876_A,t1_cqw2ssd_2,daftmunk,What I was trying to argue was that these moral beliefs are ultimately based on feelings that lead to premises that may or may not lead to arguments.
2890_A,t3_341ysq,releasethepr0n,"Fact 1: The Pope believes in an all powerful being, a.k.a. God.

Fact 2: He also believes he is God's spokesperson on Earth, and as such, he should believe he is entitled to some sort of attention by the worshiped being.

Fact 3: Yet, he does not believe such being will protect him against a shot, hence using a manmade material to grant him that protection.

That's also valid for a number of other issues as well, like the use of medicine, for instance. If he believes that God has a masterplan, then his disease must be in those plans, and to look for treatment is a denial of God's will.

Even if the spokesperson part is wrong, isn't it a lack of faith that he doesn't think God would intervene for him?

I'm talking about the Pope because he, theoretically, has a deeper connection to the Catholic god.

Please, reddit, show me where I'm wrong :)

Edit: So I think my view has been changed.

/u/Gekko_the_Great [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqk0tn) there are practical reasons that force the Pope to use such car.

/u/Hq3473 [raised](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqhtfd) interesting questions about how much is a person expected to do in order to ""help themselves"".

/u/MrMoby [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqjryw) that the Catholic God is supposed to remain uninvolved in His creation, due to free will.

/u/chicagofirefifa2 [presented](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqwjop) a theoretical possibility of God and evil existing in the same world and thus rendering the Pope's action necessary.

My view has been changed in the way of understanding how the pope, in his catholic belief, would make sense of such contradictory behaviors (1. God will provide, but 2. Just in case He doesn't I'll take care of myself). 

But the Catholic understanding still leaves a lot of open questions. Apart from my original post (which is already resolved), I think our wonderful debate still leaves unanswered the questions of 

1. how moral can an omnipotent Being be if He allows harm to be done within his creation (specially when the answer of ""respecting free will"" is so fickled in sight of the pain those free creatures actually cause. And there's the question about accidents and natural disasters...);

2. how could free will and omniscience exist in the same world (and also how does God's will fit in a world of human will supremacy, as people argued).

But I think those are topics for another CMV. 

Thanks a lot, guys. You were amazing!"
2890_A,t1_cqqx1kp_1,universal_straw,"In Matthew 4 there is this conversation between the devil and Jesus.

3636_A,t3_3g1fhs,funtomscandy," I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

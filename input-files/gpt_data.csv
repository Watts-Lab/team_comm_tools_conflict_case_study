0,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,Why did you ignore my edits on the team presentation? We agreed on them last night.,2024-09-03 20:41:32
1,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,"Your edits didn't make sense, and they were redundant. I fixed the slides.",2024-09-03 20:45:32
2,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,Who do you think you are to decide that? This isn't just your project!,2024-09-03 20:51:32
3,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,I'm the one who’s going to present it! I have to be comfortable with the content.,2024-09-03 20:53:32
4,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on finishing the project? We have a deadline.",2024-09-03 21:03:32
5,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, speaker_3! This is between speaker_2 and me!",2024-09-03 21:07:32
6,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,"No, speaker_3 is right. You're making this personal, and it's unproductive.",2024-09-03 21:08:32
7,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,Unproductive? You changed everything without even telling me. That’s disrespectful!,2024-09-03 21:14:32
8,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,Disrespectful? What’s disrespectful is wasting the team’s time with unnecessary edits.,2024-09-03 21:16:32
9,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_3,Can we please stop arguing and find a solution that works for everyone?,2024-09-03 21:24:32
10,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,Not until speaker_2 stops acting like they run the show.,2024-09-03 21:27:32
11,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,I'm just trying to get the best grade. Your edits were going to get us marked down.,2024-09-03 21:35:32
12,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,That's your opinion. You can't know that for sure.,2024-09-03 21:38:32
13,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,I’ve presented before. I know what works. You clearly don’t.,2024-09-03 21:45:32
14,escalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,"Wow, seriously? That’s how you see me?",2024-09-03 21:52:32
15,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,I can't believe you just went ahead and submitted the project without consulting any of us!,2024-09-03 20:39:35
16,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,What else was I supposed to do? You guys were taking forever to decide on anything.,2024-09-03 20:42:35
17,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_3,"Still, you should have waited. We were planning to meet tonight to finalize everything.",2024-09-03 20:52:35
18,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,"Yeah, and then we'd spend another three hours arguing over tiny details. We've been stuck for two weeks already!",2024-09-03 21:01:35
19,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,That's because we wanted it to be perfect! Now it's just rushed and full of mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:07:35
20,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,You always blow things out of proportion. It looks fine to me.,2024-09-03 21:17:35
21,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_3,"""Fine"" isn't good enough for a presentation that determines our grade! You jeopardized our entire group.",2024-09-03 21:24:35
22,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,"Maybe if you guys participated more instead of nitpicking, we wouldn’t be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:29:35
23,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,We did participate! You just never listened to any of our feedback.,2024-09-03 21:30:35
24,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_3,"Seriously, you always think you know better than everyone else. This is a teamwork project, remember?",2024-09-03 21:38:35
25,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,"Oh, please! I did all the heavy lifting while you two just criticized everything.",2024-09-03 21:39:35
26,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it. You didn't even incorporate our research properly.",2024-09-03 21:41:35
27,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_3,"Our grade is going to reflect this mess, and it's going to affect all of us. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:46:35
28,escalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,I was thinking that taking action,2024-09-03 21:49:35
29,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you weren't coming to the study group?,2024-09-03 20:43:39
30,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal. We can catch up later.,2024-09-03 20:46:39
31,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"Not a big deal? We have a presentation tomorrow, and you have all the research.",2024-09-03 20:50:39
32,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,"Well, you could have done some research yourself instead of relying entirely on me.",2024-09-03 20:52:39
33,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"That’s not fair. We agreed you’d handle the research, and I'd handle the slides.",2024-09-03 20:54:39
34,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,And I did my part; you didn't even check in with me about the progress.,2024-09-03 20:59:39
35,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,What was there to check in on? You missed the study session!,2024-09-03 21:04:39
36,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren’t so passive-aggressive about everything, I wouldn't have missed it.",2024-09-03 21:10:39
37,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"You think I'm passive-aggressive? Maybe if you were more responsible, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:15:39
38,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,Responsible? Don’t lecture me on responsibility when you can’t even manage your own tasks.,2024-09-03 21:16:39
39,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,At least I show up. You’re the one always bailing last minute.,2024-09-03 21:26:39
40,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't bail if you weren't so overbearing and demanding.,2024-09-03 21:32:39
41,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,Demanding? That's rich coming from someone who can’t stick to a commitment.,2024-09-03 21:42:39
42,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,You act like I’m the only one who’s ever dropped the ball. Look in the mirror!,2024-09-03 21:48:39
43,escalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my",2024-09-03 21:52:39
44,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,"Why did you mess up the presentation slides, Tim? It was clearly your responsibility to get it right.",2024-09-03 20:37:41
45,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,"I didn't mess them up, Sarah! You gave me the wrong info in the first place.",2024-09-03 20:45:41
46,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,"Oh, come on, Tim. Don't try to shift the blame. Everyone saw how unprepared we looked because of you.",2024-09-03 20:55:41
47,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,Unprepared? We looked unprepared because you couldn't even answer the basic questions.,2024-09-03 20:57:41
48,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously? We're in this together. Blaming each other won't help.",2024-09-03 20:58:41
49,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,"Stay out of it, Jess. This is between me and Tim.",2024-09-03 21:00:41
50,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,"Yeah, Jess, mind your own business. Sarah just can't admit her mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:08:41
51,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,My mistakes? You were the one who was supposed to finalize everything. How could you drop the ball like that?,2024-09-03 21:17:41
52,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,"Maybe if you had double-checked the data like I asked, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:23:41
53,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_3,Can we please focus on fixing this instead of pointing fingers?,2024-09-03 21:26:41
54,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,"Fixing? There's nothing to fix! The damage is already done. Thanks a lot, Tim.",2024-09-03 21:27:41
55,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault? Maybe consider how terrible your speech was. That was the real disaster.",2024-09-03 21:31:41
56,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,"At least I delivered a speech, unlike you—stumbling over every slide!",2024-09-03 21:36:41
57,escalatory_conversation_4,speaker_3,Enough! We,2024-09-03 21:41:41
58,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pick up the slack on the group project, Lisa?",2024-09-03 20:45:44
59,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,"Are you serious, Tom? I've been doing more than my share of work!",2024-09-03 20:54:44
60,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_3,Can you both stop it? This isn't getting us anywhere.,2024-09-03 21:03:44
61,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"No, Jenna, this needs to be addressed. Lisa has been slacking off.",2024-09-03 21:09:44
62,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,"I haven't been slacking off! I've balanced my tasks with my other responsibilities. Tom, you're the one who didn't even show up for the last meeting!",2024-09-03 21:10:44
63,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,I had things to do! But at least I'm honest about my priorities.,2024-09-03 21:16:44
64,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_3,"Enough! We need to focus on finishing this project, not pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 21:21:44
65,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,I agree with Jenna. But I refuse to be blamed for something I didn't do.,2024-09-03 21:22:44
66,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"Fine, you want to focus on solutions? Let's talk about how Lisa can actually contribute instead of making excuses.",2024-09-03 21:24:44
67,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,"How dare you! I've been contributing just as much as you, if not more!",2024-09-03 21:34:44
68,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_3,"Stop it, both of you! This is childish. We need a plan to move forward.",2024-09-03 21:39:44
69,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"Fine, Lisa, what exactly have you done for the project?",2024-09-03 21:47:44
70,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,I gathered all the research and summarized it. Did you even read the document I sent?,2024-09-03 21:49:44
71,escalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"Yeah, it was half-baked. I had to redo most of it!",2024-09-03 21:58:44
72,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted that report without even running it by me first!,2024-09-03 20:38:48
73,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,"You were out of the office, what was I supposed to do? Just sit on it and let the deadline pass?",2024-09-03 20:42:48
74,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,"Yes, if it meant getting it right! There were so many errors, now we look incompetent!",2024-09-03 20:47:48
75,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's all my fault now? Convenient how you forget that you were supposed to finish your part days ago!",2024-09-03 20:52:48
76,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,My part was delayed because you didn't provide the data I needed in time. Don't try to pin this on me!,2024-09-03 21:00:48
77,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,The data was ready; you didn't even check your email! Maybe if you were more organized we wouldn’t be in this mess.,2024-09-03 21:06:48
78,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,"And maybe if you took responsibility for once, we wouldn't have to deal with fixing such a disaster after the fact!",2024-09-03 21:12:48
79,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,I'm always the one cleaning up your messes! This isn't any different!,2024-09-03 21:22:48
80,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,"Oh please, everyone knows you just rush through everything without caring about quality!",2024-09-03 21:31:48
81,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,Rushing? Maybe because you never pull your weight and I end up compensating for your incompetence!,2024-09-03 21:34:48
82,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,Incompetence? You wouldn't even know what competent work looks like if it hit you in the face!,2024-09-03 21:41:48
83,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,At least I don’t spend all day criticizing others to hide my own shortcomings!,2024-09-03 21:49:48
84,escalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,Criticizing because someone,2024-09-03 21:58:48
85,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,"Alex, you didn't submit our group project on time. Now we're all getting penalized!",2024-09-03 20:39:51
86,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you had contributed more, we wouldn't have been in this mess.",2024-09-03 20:40:51
87,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_3,I did a lot of the research! It's not fair to blame me.,2024-09-03 20:46:51
88,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,Oh really? Because it looks like both Sam and I did most of the actual writing.,2024-09-03 20:53:51
89,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,That's besides the point. You were supposed to submit it. That was your task.,2024-09-03 21:00:51
90,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_3,Maybe we should've all had a more even distribution of responsibilities.,2024-09-03 21:07:51
91,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,And maybe you should have checked in more often. It's not my fault I didn't get a reminder.,2024-09-03 21:17:51
92,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,Are you serious right now? You know when deadlines are! Be responsible!,2024-09-03 21:27:51
93,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_3,And now our grade is suffering because of your carelessness.,2024-09-03 21:28:51
94,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,"If you both are so perfect, why didn't you submit it yourselves?",2024-09-03 21:38:51
95,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,Because we TRUSTED you to do your part!,2024-09-03 21:48:51
96,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_3,This is ridiculous. I'm not taking the fall for your oversight.,2024-09-03 21:56:51
97,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,"Look, everyone makes mistakes. At least admit there's shared blame here.",2024-09-03 21:59:51
98,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,"Blame? Fine, we all share it. But let's figure out how to not let this happen again.",2024-09-03 22:05:51
99,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_3,Agreed. Next time we need more communication and shared checkpoints.,2024-09-03 22:10:51
100,escalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,Fine. I'll own,2024-09-03 22:18:51
101,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,I can't believe you messed up the group project like that!,2024-09-03 20:45:53
102,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault? What about your unfinished slides?",2024-09-03 20:52:53
103,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,My slides were almost done! At least I didn't miss half the meetings!,2024-09-03 20:58:53
104,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,I had work! Not everyone has a free schedule like you.,2024-09-03 21:02:53
105,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you, chill. We're all responsible here.",2024-09-03 21:06:53
106,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you didn't even contribute as much.",2024-09-03 21:08:53
107,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_3,"I did my part, thank you very much. Maybe you should all learn to communicate better.",2024-09-03 21:09:53
108,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Oh great, just pile on why don't you? This isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:18:53
109,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,"Maybe if we had a leader who knew what they were doing, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:22:53
110,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_3,So now you're blaming leadership? You didn't even volunteer!,2024-09-03 21:23:53
111,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Look, this is pointless. What's done is done. We need to figure out how to salvage this.",2024-09-03 21:30:53
112,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,Salvage it? We barely have any time left!,2024-09-03 21:37:53
113,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_3,"Maybe if we stop arguing and actually work on it, we might stand a chance.",2024-09-03 21:40:53
114,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Fine, then what do we need to do next?",2024-09-03 21:49:53
115,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,"We need to redo the entire presentation, that's what.",2024-09-03 21:56:53
116,escalatory_conversation_8,speaker_3,Redo? Are you serious? There's no way we can finish that in time.,2024-09-03 22:04:53
117,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,"Why are you always late to our band practice, Jake?",2024-09-03 20:37:56
118,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. It's just a few minutes, what's the big deal?",2024-09-03 20:43:56
119,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,The big deal is that it wastes everyone's time. We can't get anything done if you're not here!,2024-09-03 20:48:56
120,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,"Seriously, Jake. We're trying to get ready for the school talent show, and your tardiness is messing everything up.",2024-09-03 20:52:56
121,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe I wouldn't be late if you guys didn't change the practice schedule every other week!,2024-09-03 21:00:56
122,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,"We changed it because Steve has basketball, and we all agreed on the new time.",2024-09-03 21:04:56
123,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,"Well, apparently not everyone can make it, clearly.",2024-09-03 21:07:56
124,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,"You agreed on it too, Jake. Don't act like this is news to you.",2024-09-03 21:08:56
125,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,Why don't you all just admit you like blaming me for everything?,2024-09-03 21:14:56
126,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,"We're not blaming you for everything, just for being late consistently.",2024-09-03 21:22:56
127,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,"Yeah, it's not fair to the rest of us who show up on time.",2024-09-03 21:23:56
128,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,It's not fair to keep changing schedules without considering everyone's situation.,2024-09-03 21:26:56
129,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,"Alright, fine. What schedule works for you, Jake? Let's hear it.",2024-09-03 21:29:56
130,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,Maybe one that doesn't start right after school when I have detention could work.,2024-09-03 21:36:56
131,escalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,"Wait, you have detention? Why didn't you say something?",2024-09-03 21:39:56
132,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,I can't believe you just bailed on the team halfway through the project!,2024-09-03 20:45:59
133,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,I had something important come up! You always act like you’re the only one with responsibilities.,2024-09-03 20:48:59
134,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,That's because I am the only one who actually gets anything done around here!,2024-09-03 20:57:59
135,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,"Hey, let’s not forget we all have parts to play. Accusations won’t help us finish this project.",2024-09-03 21:07:59
136,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you're the one who barely shows up to meetings!",2024-09-03 21:13:59
137,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,I've been swamped with work too! But at least I'm not making excuses like someone.,2024-09-03 21:16:59
138,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,"Enough with the excuses, all I see is the deadline approaching and no progress!",2024-09-03 21:25:59
139,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't hog all the tasks, we'd feel more motivated to participate!",2024-09-03 21:32:59
140,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,"Agreed, you always want it done your way and it kills any teamwork spirit.",2024-09-03 21:38:59
141,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,My way is the only way things get done correctly! Do you want to fail?,2024-09-03 21:45:59
142,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,"No, but I refuse to be treated like a second-class team member.",2024-09-03 21:52:59
143,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,We need to share the workload equally if we want to see this through.,2024-09-03 21:54:59
144,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,"Fine, but if things go wrong, don’t come crying to me.",2024-09-03 21:56:59
145,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,"If you keep this attitude, it'll definitely go wrong.",2024-09-03 22:06:59
146,escalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,Let’s set our egos aside and split the tasks,2024-09-03 22:13:59
147,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,"Why did you take all the credit for our project, Sarah?",2024-09-03 20:45:02
148,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,"I didn't take all the credit, Max. I did most of the work!",2024-09-03 20:46:02
149,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,That's not true! We both contributed equally.,2024-09-03 20:53:02
150,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,Really? Because it seemed like I was the one staying up all night to finish it while you were out with your friends.,2024-09-03 20:59:02
151,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,"That's unfair, I had other responsibilities too. And I was the one who collected all the data.",2024-09-03 21:03:02
152,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,"Collecting data is just one part. I had to put it all together, analyze it, and write the report!",2024-09-03 21:07:02
153,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,You wouldn't even have anything to analyze without my data.,2024-09-03 21:12:02
154,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,"And we wouldn’t have a cohesive report without my analysis. It goes both ways, Max!",2024-09-03 21:17:02
155,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,"Fine, but you didn't have to make it look like I did nothing in front of the professor.",2024-09-03 21:25:02
156,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,I didn't say you did nothing. I merely pointed out who did the majority of the work.,2024-09-03 21:27:02
157,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,That's not how it came off. You basically threw me under the bus!,2024-09-03 21:34:02
158,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,Maybe you feel that way because deep down you know you didn't pull your weight.,2024-09-03 21:37:02
159,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,"That’s low, Sarah. I thought we were supposed to be a team.",2024-09-03 21:43:02
160,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,A team where one person slacks off isn't much of a team.,2024-09-03 21:49:02
161,escalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,I didn’t,2024-09-03 21:59:02
162,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"You seriously dropped the ball on the project deadline, didn't you?",2024-09-03 20:41:05
163,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I did everything I was supposed to do!,2024-09-03 20:51:05
164,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"Oh, really? Because I had to scramble to get it finished last minute!",2024-09-03 20:59:05
165,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,That wasn't my fault. You didn't communicate what needed to be done properly!,2024-09-03 21:04:05
166,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. We've got bigger issues. The client is furious.,2024-09-03 21:09:05
167,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"Furious? Because someone didn't pull their weight, and now we look like idiots!",2024-09-03 21:12:05
168,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,"Stop putting all the blame on me. Maybe if you didn't micromanage every single step, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:17:05
169,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_3,Arguing is not solving anything. We need a plan to fix this now.,2024-09-03 21:20:05
170,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"The plan should have been clear from the start. But no, everyone had to do their own thing.",2024-09-03 21:28:05
171,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,"You're impossible to work with, you know that? Always pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 21:33:05
172,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_3,Can we focus? We're wasting valuable time and making it worse.,2024-09-03 21:42:05
173,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,Fine. But this is the last time I'm covering for anyone here.,2024-09-03 21:46:05
174,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,Covering? You didn't cover for anyone. You just made it harder.,2024-09-03 21:48:05
175,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_3,Enough! We need to regroup and present a united front to the client.,2024-09-03 21:54:05
176,escalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"Just make sure we don't end up in this situation again,",2024-09-03 22:03:05
177,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"Why didn't you give me the report on time, if you knew it was urgent?",2024-09-03 20:44:09
178,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,I told you I was swamped with other tasks; you can't expect me to do everything at once.,2024-09-03 20:53:09
179,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"That's just an excuse. We all have tasks, but I still managed to submit mine.",2024-09-03 20:55:09
180,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,Maybe because you didn't take on as much as I did. You always delegate the hard parts to me.,2024-09-03 21:04:09
181,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,That's not true! You're just looking for someone to blame for your inefficiency.,2024-09-03 21:12:09
182,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,Inefficiency? Seriously? Coming from someone who spent half the meeting checking their phone?,2024-09-03 21:21:09
183,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,I was checking for updates related to the project! At least I'm proactive.,2024-09-03 21:27:09
184,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,Proactive? More like pretending to be busy while others pick up your slack!,2024-09-03 21:33:09
185,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"If you have such a problem with how I work, why don't you say something to the boss?",2024-09-03 21:41:09
186,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,Maybe I will! Maybe then everyone will see what a fraud you are.,2024-09-03 21:47:09
187,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,Go ahead. I'll be glad when people finally see how you can't handle pressure.,2024-09-03 21:49:09
188,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,And I'll be glad when they see you're nothing but a show-off trying to take credit for everyone else’s hard work.,2024-09-03 21:53:09
189,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"This is getting us nowhere. If you can't be a team player, maybe you don’t belong here.",2024-09-03 21:58:09
190,escalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,"Oh, trust me, I'm",2024-09-03 22:00:09
191,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,I don't get why you keep giving me more work when I'm already buried under a pile of tasks.,2024-09-03 20:47:12
192,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"Maybe if you managed your time better, you wouldn't be struggling so much.",2024-09-03 20:55:12
193,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,That's easy for you to say when you're not the one drowning in deadlines.,2024-09-03 20:59:12
194,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"Well, if you could actually follow instructions properly, you wouldn't have this problem.",2024-09-03 21:09:12
195,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_3,Can you both stop? This constant bickering isn't helping anyone.,2024-09-03 21:17:12
196,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,Why should I listen to you? You're not the one caught between their unrealistic expectations and my workload.,2024-09-03 21:19:12
197,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe you're just not cut out for this project if you can't handle a bit of pressure.,2024-09-03 21:24:12
198,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_3,"Seriously, can't we just focus on finding a solution instead of pointing fingers?",2024-09-03 21:34:12
199,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,Of course you'd side with them. You always do.,2024-09-03 21:43:12
200,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,Are you implying there's some kind of conspiracy against you? That's ridiculous.,2024-09-03 21:44:12
201,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_3,"Look, we're all on the same team. What's the point of tearing each other apart?",2024-09-03 21:53:12
202,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,"The point is, I'm tired of being the scapegoat every time something goes wrong.",2024-09-03 21:55:12
203,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"Maybe if you stopped making mistakes, you wouldn’t feel like the scapegoat.",2024-09-03 22:01:12
204,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_3,Enough! Can we please try to figure out how to distribute the workload more evenly?,2024-09-03 22:06:12
205,escalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,"Fine, but don't expect me to just",2024-09-03 22:07:12
206,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,"I can't believe you deleted my part of the presentation, Sarah.",2024-09-03 20:46:15
207,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Mark. Your slides were completely off-topic.",2024-09-03 20:56:15
208,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,Off-topic?! I spent hours on those!,2024-09-03 20:59:15
209,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,"Yeah, and it didn't contribute anything useful. We need this project to be focused, remember?",2024-09-03 21:05:15
210,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_3,Can we calm down here? We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 21:11:15
211,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,"Well, some team we are when Sarah thinks she can just override everyone's work!",2024-09-03 21:17:15
212,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually listened to feedback, this wouldn't be an issue.",2024-09-03 21:25:15
213,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously, arguing isn't going to fix the presentation.",2024-09-03 21:35:15
214,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,"You're right, but I can't work with someone who doesn't respect my contribution.",2024-09-03 21:37:15
215,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,Respect your contribution? You didn't even read the project brief correctly!,2024-09-03 21:39:15
216,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_3,We're wasting time. Can we just find a way to incorporate both perspectives?,2024-09-03 21:43:15
217,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,Why should I compromise when she didn't even ask me before deleting?,2024-09-03 21:48:15
218,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,"Fine, next time I'll ask before saving us all from embarrassment.",2024-09-03 21:54:15
219,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_3,Enough! This isn't solving anything. Let's start by outlining what needs to be included and go from there.,2024-09-03 21:58:15
220,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,"Maybe, but I'm not sure I can trust Sarah to be a team player.",2024-09-03 22:00:15
221,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,"Trust works both ways, Mark.",2024-09-03 22:09:15
222,escalatory_conversation_15,speaker_3,Can we at least agree to communicate better and,2024-09-03 22:17:15
223,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,I can't believe you threw out my project proposal without even reading it!,2024-09-03 20:40:17
224,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,"I told you, we had no time for extra proposals; the deadline was too close.",2024-09-03 20:44:17
225,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,That's not an excuse! You should have at least given it a chance!,2024-09-03 20:51:17
226,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,And waste more time when we were already behind? Be realistic.,2024-09-03 20:54:17
227,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_3,"Both of you need to calm down. We're all stressed out, but fighting won't help.",2024-09-03 21:02:17
228,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you didn't have your work dismissed like it was nothing!",2024-09-03 21:09:17
229,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,Maybe because their proposals actually met the requirements? Did you think of that?,2024-09-03 21:18:17
230,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_3,Now that's just uncalled for. We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 21:22:17
231,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,A team where some members think they're more important than others?,2024-09-03 21:32:17
232,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,"I didn't say that, but if the shoe fits...",2024-09-03 21:36:17
233,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_3,Can we please keep this professional? We're getting nowhere with this argument.,2024-09-03 21:44:17
234,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,How can I be professional when my work isn't respected?,2024-09-03 21:49:17
235,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,"Respect is earned by contributing useful, completed work, not half-baked ideas.",2024-09-03 21:55:17
236,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_3,Enough! How about we all take a step back and review the decisions together?,2024-09-03 22:01:17
237,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,There's nothing to review! My proposal was trashed without a second thought.,2024-09-03 22:09:17
238,escalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,Because it didn't align with the project's objectives. Stop taking it so personally.,2024-09-03 22:13:17
239,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for band practice again, Rick?",2024-09-03 20:44:20
240,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,"Calm down, Sarah. I had other things to do.",2024-09-03 20:45:20
241,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,Other things? We're supposed to be preparing for the school talent show!,2024-09-03 20:52:20
242,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,It's not like you couldn't practice without me. I've got my own life.,2024-09-03 20:56:20
243,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,That's not the point. We all depend on each other. You're letting everyone down!,2024-09-03 20:59:20
244,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,"Maybe if the practice sessions weren't so disorganized, I'd actually want to be there.",2024-09-03 21:09:20
245,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_3,"Guys, we need to focus. Arguing won't solve anything.",2024-09-03 21:10:20
246,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, Mike. Rick needs to understand how serious this is.",2024-09-03 21:19:20
247,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_3,"I'm just saying, we need to find a solution, not keep yelling.",2024-09-03 21:25:20
248,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,"Fine, what solution? You're all just mad at me!",2024-09-03 21:27:20
249,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,How about you commit to the schedule we all agreed on?,2024-09-03 21:33:20
250,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,It’s not that easy for me. You know I have a part-time job and other commitments.,2024-09-03 21:34:20
251,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,"Everyone has commitments, Rick. That’s not an excuse to let your team down.",2024-09-03 21:43:20
252,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because your life is so much harder than mine?",2024-09-03 21:49:20
253,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_3,This isn't about who has the harder life. We need to figure out how to practice effectively.,2024-09-03 21:54:20
254,escalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,Effective practices don’t happen if someone doesn’t show,2024-09-03 21:56:20
255,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,Why did you change the project proposal without telling any of us?,2024-09-03 20:45:23
256,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,Because someone had to take charge! The original plan was going nowhere.,2024-09-03 20:54:23
257,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_3,You can’t just make decisions for the whole group without consulting us!,2024-09-03 20:55:23
258,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,"Well, if you actually contributed something, maybe I'd consult you!",2024-09-03 21:01:23
259,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,That’s not fair. We agreed on the original plan together.,2024-09-03 21:08:23
260,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,And it was a terrible plan! Do you want us to fail this class?,2024-09-03 21:15:23
261,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_3,"This isn’t about failing. It’s about teamwork, which you clearly don’t understand.",2024-09-03 21:19:23
262,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,Teamwork? More like dead weight. I had to do something to save our grade.,2024-09-03 21:25:23
263,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,How do you expect us to trust you now? We might as well be working solo.,2024-09-03 21:31:23
264,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,Maybe you should be! You’re both dragging me down.,2024-09-03 21:33:23
265,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_3,"Dragging you down? We’re doing our best. Unlike you, we don’t just take over.",2024-09-03 21:41:23
266,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,"Exactly. A team works together, not against each other.",2024-09-03 21:49:23
267,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,"Fine then, maybe I’ll just do the whole project myself. You two can relax.",2024-09-03 21:53:23
268,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_3,That’s not the point! This is supposed to be a collaborative effort.,2024-09-03 21:56:23
269,escalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,"You know what? If you want to be a dictator, go ahead. But don’t expect us to support you.",2024-09-03 22:05:23
270,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,Why did you take the last of the office supplies without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 20:39:26
271,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"I needed them for my project, and no one else seemed to be using them.",2024-09-03 20:47:26
272,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"That's not the point! We share supplies, and you should have checked with the team first.",2024-09-03 20:51:26
273,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you guys actually managed the inventory better, this wouldn't happen.",2024-09-03 21:01:26
274,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. We need to find a solution, not fight about it.",2024-09-03 21:11:26
275,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,I'm tired of always having to deal with the mess you create!,2024-09-03 21:15:26
276,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"Oh, please, like you're so perfect. At least I get my projects done on time.",2024-09-03 21:24:26
277,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_3,This isn't productive. Let's figure out a way to prevent this in the future.,2024-09-03 21:26:26
278,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"Fine, how about we all have our own supplies and don't touch anyone else's?",2024-09-03 21:34:26
279,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,That's ridiculous. We shouldn't have to work in silos just because you can't handle a little cooperation.,2024-09-03 21:38:26
280,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_3,"Nobody is saying that, but maybe we need a better system for tracking who uses what.",2024-09-03 21:44:26
281,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"That's a start, but it doesn't address the core issue—respecting shared resources.",2024-09-03 21:52:26
282,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"Respect goes both ways, you know. You could try communicating before blowing up.",2024-09-03 21:56:26
283,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_3,Can we agree to create a sign-out sheet for supplies and discuss big projects in team meetings?,2024-09-03 22:05:26
284,escalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,Fine,2024-09-03 22:10:26
285,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the project without telling me, Sarah!",2024-09-03 20:44:29
286,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Mark! You weren't even around to help finish it. I had no choice!",2024-09-03 20:50:29
287,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,That's because I was working on the data analysis you said you couldn't handle!,2024-09-03 20:52:29
288,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you actually communicated, I wouldn't have to make these decisions on my own!",2024-09-03 20:57:29
289,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,Communicate? You're the one who disappeared for an entire week without a word!,2024-09-03 20:59:29
290,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"I had personal stuff going on, alright? You don’t know everything I’m dealing with.",2024-09-03 21:06:29
291,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,"And how am I supposed to know if you don’t tell me, Sarah? We're supposed to be a team!",2024-09-03 21:07:29
292,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,A team? It feels more like you want to control every single aspect of this project!,2024-09-03 21:17:29
293,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,Control? I just want things done right! Your last-minute changes almost cost us the client!,2024-09-03 21:21:29
294,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"Don't you dare put all the blame on me! You're not perfect either. Your analysis had errors, Mark!",2024-09-03 21:27:29
295,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,"Those errors were fixable, unlike your sloppy presentation slides!",2024-09-03 21:36:29
296,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"Sloppy? At least I know how to make a deadline, Mr. Perfectionist!",2024-09-03 21:42:29
297,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,"Maybe if you spent more time focusing and less time on social media, we'd actually get somewhere!",2024-09-03 21:46:29
298,escalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're stalking",2024-09-03 21:54:29
299,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Jake? We had a clear shot!",2024-09-03 20:41:32
300,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,"You were too far back, Lisa. I had a better angle. We needed points quickly.",2024-09-03 20:48:32
301,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,That’s not true! I've made shots from that distance before. You just don’t trust me.,2024-09-03 20:52:32
302,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,"It’s not about trust, it’s about making the right play. Stop taking it so personally.",2024-09-03 20:57:32
303,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,I am taking it personally because you keep doing this. It's like you think you’re the only one who can score.,2024-09-03 21:05:32
304,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_3,Can you both stop fighting? We’re losing because we’re not working together.,2024-09-03 21:12:32
305,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,"Oh great, now you're taking his side too? This is unbelievable.",2024-09-03 21:14:32
306,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_3,I’m not taking sides! I just want us to focus and try to win for once!,2024-09-03 21:22:32
307,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,"If Lisa would just stick to her role and stop trying to be the hero, maybe we could.",2024-09-03 21:32:32
308,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,My role? Are you serious right now? We’re a team; everyone should have a chance.,2024-09-03 21:40:32
309,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,And you’ve had plenty of chances that you’ve blown.,2024-09-03 21:49:32
310,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_3,Enough! Let’s call a timeout and sort this out. We’re losing valuable game time.,2024-09-03 21:54:32
311,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,This is ridiculous. Maybe sitting on the bench would be better if you both think I’m that useless.,2024-09-03 21:56:32
312,escalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,Fine! Maybe then,2024-09-03 21:58:32
313,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design sketches, Mark?",2024-09-03 20:42:36
314,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,"I didn't take them, Sarah. You always misplace your stuff and blame me.",2024-09-03 20:50:36
315,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"Don't lie, Mark. I saw them on your desk this morning.",2024-09-03 21:00:36
316,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,I had my own sketches on my desk! Stop accusing me of stealing your work.,2024-09-03 21:03:36
317,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_3,"Hey, what's going on here? Why are you two shouting?",2024-09-03 21:04:36
318,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"Emily, Mark took my design sketches even though he denies it.",2024-09-03 21:11:36
319,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,I did not! Sarah just can't keep track of her own things.,2024-09-03 21:14:36
320,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_3,Can we calm down for a second? Maybe there's a misunderstanding.,2024-09-03 21:17:36
321,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,The misunderstanding is that Mark thinks he can just take my work and get away with it.,2024-09-03 21:25:36
322,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,You're being paranoid. I don't need your sketches. My designs are way better anyway.,2024-09-03 21:35:36
323,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"There it is, the arrogance. You always think you're better than everyone else.",2024-09-03 21:42:36
324,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_3,Both of you need to stop. This isn't helping anyone. Let's figure out what happened.,2024-09-03 21:49:36
325,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"Fine, but I want my sketches back, and I want to know why Mark took them.",2024-09-03 21:59:36
326,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,"I didn't take them, so stop accusing me. Maybe you should look through your messy desk again.",2024-09-03 22:09:36
327,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,My desk isn't the problem here. Your dishonesty is.,2024-09-03 22:13:36
328,escalatory_conversation_22,speaker_3,This is getting us nowhere,2024-09-03 22:17:36
329,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just bailed on the group project meeting again, David.",2024-09-03 20:39:39
330,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,"I told you, I had another commitment. It's not like I'm doing nothing.",2024-09-03 20:45:39
331,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"We all have commitments, but we make time for this because it's important. You can't keep skipping out and expect us to cover for you.",2024-09-03 20:51:39
332,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the bad guy? You know the professor assigned us an unrealistic deadline. What do you want me to do about it?",2024-09-03 21:00:39
333,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on getting the project done? This arguing isn’t helping anyone.",2024-09-03 21:01:39
334,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"No, we need to address this. David, you need to start showing up or at least communicate when you can't make it.",2024-09-03 21:09:39
335,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,"And what exactly have you been doing, huh? Don't act like you're the only one contributing here.",2024-09-03 21:17:39
336,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,At least I'm showing up and putting in the effort. The rest of us are pulling your weight.,2024-09-03 21:21:39
337,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,"You're seriously exaggerating. I said I’d handle the data analysis, and I will.",2024-09-03 21:31:39
338,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_3,"This is really getting out of hand. David, can you commit to a schedule so we can all plan accordingly?",2024-09-03 21:34:39
339,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,"Fine, but don't expect miracles. This whole setup was doomed from the start.",2024-09-03 21:40:39
340,escalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"Oh, come on. The only thing dooming this project is your attitude and lack of participation.",2024-09-03 21:46:39
341,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,I can't believe you took my design and presented it as your own!,2024-09-03 20:41:42
342,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,"What are you talking about? I made some changes, it became my design.",2024-09-03 20:51:42
343,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,"No, you just tweaked a few things. It's still my idea, and you know it!",2024-09-03 20:53:42
344,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,"Well, if you had spoken up during the meeting, maybe you'd have gotten credit.",2024-09-03 20:55:42
345,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,"I was going to, but you cut me off at every chance!",2024-09-03 20:58:42
346,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,That's just business. Adapt or get left behind.,2024-09-03 21:07:42
347,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,"You can't just brush it off as ""business."" It's dishonest!",2024-09-03 21:12:42
348,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so naive, you'd understand how things work.",2024-09-03 21:15:42
349,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,This isn't about being naive; it's about integrity!,2024-09-03 21:22:42
350,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,"Well, it's my name on the project now, so deal with it.",2024-09-03 21:29:42
351,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,This isn't over. I'll make sure everyone knows the truth.,2024-09-03 21:32:42
352,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,Go ahead and try. Let's see who they believe.,2024-09-03 21:36:42
353,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,You're underestimating how much people value honesty.,2024-09-03 21:45:42
354,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,And you're underestimating how much they value results.,2024-09-03 21:50:42
355,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,"Fine, but don't be surprised when karma catches up with you.",2024-09-03 21:54:42
356,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,Bring it on. I'm not afraid of your empty threats.,2024-09-03 22:03:42
357,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,They're not empty threats. You'll see soon enough.,2024-09-03 22:05:42
358,escalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,Whatever. I've got more important things,2024-09-03 22:11:42
359,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't tell me about the deadline change for the project!,2024-09-03 20:41:45
360,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,I assumed you checked the project board. It's your responsibility too.,2024-09-03 20:45:45
361,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,Checking the board? Really? You know how busy I've been with the new clients.,2024-09-03 20:54:45
362,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,"And you think I'm just lounging around? We're all busy, don't make excuses.",2024-09-03 20:55:45
363,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,Excuses? You’re the one who always drops the ball and expects me to pick up the pieces.,2024-09-03 20:56:45
364,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,That's rich coming from the person who missed two meetings last week.,2024-09-03 21:04:45
365,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,Missed meetings because I was actually securing deals for the firm. What's your excuse?,2024-09-03 21:13:45
366,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,"At least I am trying to keep everything organized, something you clearly can’t manage.",2024-09-03 21:22:45
367,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,Organized? Then why is everything always a mess whenever you're in charge?,2024-09-03 21:26:45
368,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,"Maybe if you did your part instead of blaming me for everything, we wouldn’t be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:31:45
369,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's entirely my fault? That's really convenient for you, isn't it?",2024-09-03 21:35:45
370,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,"Convenient? No, it’s the reality you refuse to see because you think you're above these tasks.",2024-09-03 21:38:45
371,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,I don't think I'm above anything. I just expect some basic professionalism from my team.,2024-09-03 21:43:45
372,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,Professionalism? Look who’s talking! The person who doesn't even communicate properly!,2024-09-03 21:47:45
373,escalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,Maybe if you weren’t,2024-09-03 21:56:45
374,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me that you were planning to change the presentation last minute?,2024-09-03 20:45:48
375,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"Because every time I propose an idea, you shoot it down anyway, so what's the point?",2024-09-03 20:50:48
376,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,"Are you serious right now? As the project leader, I need to be kept in the loop!",2024-09-03 20:57:48
377,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"Yeah, well maybe if you weren't such a control freak, people wouldn't feel the need to go behind your back!",2024-09-03 21:00:48
378,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you need to calm down. This isn't helping us finish the project on time.",2024-09-03 21:10:48
379,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,"No, this is exactly why we're behind schedule! Lack of communication and unilateral decisions!",2024-09-03 21:16:48
380,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"Unilateral decisions? Oh, you mean like all the ones you make without consulting any of us?",2024-09-03 21:24:48
381,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,I consult when it's necessary. I don't have time to question every minor detail.,2024-09-03 21:30:48
382,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"Minor detail? Changing the entire presentation format is a ""minor detail"" to you?",2024-09-03 21:37:48
383,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_3,We need to focus on finding a solution rather than pointing fingers right now.,2024-09-03 21:42:48
384,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,"The solution was clear from the start, and it didn’t involve last-minute changes!",2024-09-03 21:45:48
385,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"And maybe if you were a little more open to suggestions, we wouldn’t be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:46:48
386,escalatory_conversation_26,speaker_3,"Look, why don't we just layout what needs to be done and divide the tasks? This argument is wasting even more time.",2024-09-03 21:55:48
387,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,I can't believe you forgot to submit the group project! How could you be so careless?,2024-09-03 20:47:51
388,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,Me? You were supposed to remind me! Don't act like you're blameless here.,2024-09-03 20:53:51
389,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,I shouldn't have to remind you; we're both responsible adults. You should set reminders for yourself.,2024-09-03 20:59:51
390,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,"Oh, like you did such a stellar job? You didn't even finish your part until the last minute!",2024-09-03 21:09:51
391,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. We need to figure out what to do next.",2024-09-03 21:18:51
392,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,"Don't try to play mediator, we all know you barely contributed anything to the project.",2024-09-03 21:19:51
393,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_3,"That's not fair, you didn't even bother to ask for my input half the time.",2024-09-03 21:20:51
394,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,Maybe because your input was always last-minute and half-baked.,2024-09-03 21:22:51
395,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,"Exactly, we couldn't rely on you. The project failed because of both of your incompetence.",2024-09-03 21:24:51
396,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_3,My incompetence? I've been dealing with both of your egos the entire time!,2024-09-03 21:32:51
397,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,"Oh please, like you're any better. This whole project has been a disaster because we didn't work together.",2024-09-03 21:36:51
398,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,I can't believe you still don't see your own mistakes. This is unbelievable.,2024-09-03 21:42:51
399,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_3,"We don't have time for this blame game! We need to come up with a solution, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:52:51
400,escalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,The solution is simple: we need to communicate,2024-09-03 22:00:51
401,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"You always hog the lab equipment, Sarah. It's impossible to get any of my project done!",2024-09-03 20:44:54
402,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"Oh really, Tom? Maybe if you actually showed up on time for our scheduled slots, you'd get a chance to use it!",2024-09-03 20:46:54
403,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"I've had to cover for you in other classes, Sarah. It's not like you're always so reliable.",2024-09-03 20:52:54
404,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"That's completely unfair. I'm dedicated to this group project, more than I can say for you.",2024-09-03 20:55:54
405,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"Dedicated? You didn't even submit the last batch of data on time, and now we're behind!",2024-09-03 21:00:54
406,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,Because I had to redo the experiments you botched. Your measurements were all over the place!,2024-09-03 21:01:54
407,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Maybe if you shared your methods, we could have cross-checked!",2024-09-03 21:06:54
408,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,I would share more if you bothered to communicate instead of running off on your own tangents.,2024-09-03 21:07:54
409,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"You know what, Sarah? I've had enough of this. Maybe we should talk to Professor Allen about splitting the project.",2024-09-03 21:16:54
410,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"Fine by me, Tom! At least this way, I won't have to deal with your disorganization dragging me down.",2024-09-03 21:21:54
411,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,And I won't have to deal with your condescending attitude. Good luck handling everything yourself!,2024-09-03 21:31:54
412,escalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"Likewise, Tom. Don't expect me to bail you out when you can't manage on your own.",2024-09-03 21:41:54
413,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took the lead on the project without even discussing it with us, Chris.",2024-09-03 20:46:57
414,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Alex! I got tired of waiting for you all to make a decision; someone had to step up.",2024-09-03 20:50:57
415,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,"Step up? More like step all over us. We had a plan, and you just disregarded it.",2024-09-03 20:54:57
416,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"The plan was going nowhere, Maria! We were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:00:57
417,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,That's no excuse for taking over everything. This was supposed to be a group effort.,2024-09-03 21:03:57
418,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,Group effort? You two were dragging your feet and wasting time. I had to make a move.,2024-09-03 21:04:57
419,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,Moving without consent is not leadership; it's dictatorship.,2024-09-03 21:10:57
420,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Dictatorship? Don't be dramatic, Maria. We needed direction, and I provided it.",2024-09-03 21:17:57
421,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,"At what cost, Chris? You've alienated everyone on the team.",2024-09-03 21:24:57
422,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,Exactly. No one feels valued anymore. This isn't the way to lead.,2024-09-03 21:27:57
423,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you both contributed more, it wouldn't have come to this.",2024-09-03 21:31:57
424,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,We were contributing. Just because we didn't agree with your approach doesn't mean we were lazy.,2024-09-03 21:34:57
425,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,"Chris, you've turned this project into your personal showcase. It's not fair to any of us.",2024-09-03 21:43:57
426,escalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Fair? What's fair is getting the job done, which is something neither",2024-09-03 21:50:57
427,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,Why did you delete my part of the report without asking me first?,2024-09-03 20:47:00
428,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,"Because it was filled with errors, and we don’t have time to fix all your mistakes right now.",2024-09-03 20:53:00
429,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,My work wasn’t that bad! You always think you’re so perfect.,2024-09-03 21:00:00
430,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,"Maybe because I actually know what I’m doing. Unlike you, apparently.",2024-09-03 21:03:00
431,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,"Wow, nice. Great way to support your team, by being a total jerk.",2024-09-03 21:09:00
432,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,"Oh please, spare me. Supporting the team means making sure we don’t fail because of sloppy work.",2024-09-03 21:12:00
433,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,"Sloppy work? I stayed late every night to get that done, while you were out partying.",2024-09-03 21:18:00
434,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,It’s not my fault if you can’t manage your time properly. Maybe you should work on being more efficient.,2024-09-03 21:26:00
435,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,Maybe you should work on not being so arrogant for a change.,2024-09-03 21:30:00
436,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,And maybe you should accept some constructive criticism without throwing a tantrum.,2024-09-03 21:32:00
437,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,"Maybe I would, if your criticism were actually constructive and not just rude comments.",2024-09-03 21:34:00
438,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,Fine. Next time I’ll just let you submit subpar work and watch us fail.,2024-09-03 21:41:00
439,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,Go ahead. Maybe then you’ll realize you’re not as indispensable as you think you are.,2024-09-03 21:45:00
440,escalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,"At least I’m trying to save this project, not dragging it down with incompetence.",2024-09-03 21:52:00
441,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,I can't believe you took credit for my presentation in front of the whole company.,2024-09-03 20:41:03
442,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,"What do you mean ""your"" presentation? I worked on it just as hard as you did.",2024-09-03 20:50:03
443,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,Are you serious? I did all the research and put the slides together. You just added a couple of points.,2024-09-03 21:00:03
444,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,"Oh, right. Because adding key data points counts for nothing, right?",2024-09-03 21:02:03
445,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_3,"Can you two calm down? We're supposed to be a team, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:05:03
446,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,I'm calm! I just want recognition for my hard work.,2024-09-03 21:10:03
447,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,And I want you to stop acting like you're the only one who does anything around here!,2024-09-03 21:17:03
448,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_3,This isn't helping. We need to talk this through rationally.,2024-09-03 21:21:03
449,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you weren't the one being disrespected.",2024-09-03 21:25:03
450,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,Disrespected? Get off your high horse. You're not the only one who's frustrated!,2024-09-03 21:30:03
451,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_3,"Fine, if this is how it's going to be, maybe we shouldn't be working together at all.",2024-09-03 21:33:03
452,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,Maybe you're right. Better to work alone than with someone who steals your ideas.,2024-09-03 21:38:03
453,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,And better to work alone than with someone who thinks they're above everyone else.,2024-09-03 21:41:03
454,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_3,"Great, we've gone from a team project to an all-out war. Just perfect.",2024-09-03 21:50:03
455,escalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,If you can't,2024-09-03 21:59:03
456,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,"Why do you always have to undermine me in front of the clients, Tom?",2024-09-03 20:40:06
457,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"Undermine you? I'm just correcting your mistakes, Sarah.",2024-09-03 20:47:06
458,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,Correcting my mistakes? It feels more like you're trying to make me look incompetent.,2024-09-03 20:55:06
459,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more attentive to details, I wouldn't have to step in.",2024-09-03 21:00:06
460,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,"Attentive to details? I double-check everything, unlike you, who rushes through important work.",2024-09-03 21:07:06
461,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"Oh, like you didn't rush the Miller report? It was a mess!",2024-09-03 21:14:06
462,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,That was one oversight! You made three major errors last month alone!,2024-09-03 21:16:06
463,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"At least I own up to my mistakes and fix them, not blame others.",2024-09-03 21:23:06
464,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,Blame others? You've never once admitted when you've messed up. You're all about saving face.,2024-09-03 21:26:06
465,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,And you're all about playing the victim. Grow up!,2024-09-03 21:36:06
466,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_3,Can both of you stop this? You're disrupting the entire office.,2024-09-03 21:46:06
467,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,We're just addressing a problem that keeps coming up.,2024-09-03 21:47:06
468,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,Addressing it? We're going in circles because Sarah can't take criticism.,2024-09-03 21:55:06
469,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_3,This isn't the place or time to settle personal scores.,2024-09-03 21:58:06
470,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,Personal scores? This impacts the whole team's performance.,2024-09-03 22:00:06
471,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"Exactly, and we can't afford to have weak links.",2024-09-03 22:08:06
472,escalatory_conversation_32,speaker_3,Enough! Let's discuss this in,2024-09-03 22:15:06
473,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,"You always put yourself first, Jenny. Why do you always double-book our study meetings?",2024-09-03 20:40:09
474,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Maybe if you planned things better, Zack, I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 20:49:09
475,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,Are you seriously blaming me for your lack of commitment?,2024-09-03 20:56:09
476,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Lack of commitment? I have a job and other classes, Zack. I can't drop everything whenever you decide to change the plan.",2024-09-03 20:59:09
477,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,I'm not changing the plan constantly. You never seem to respect anyone else's priorities but your own.,2024-09-03 21:02:09
478,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,Is that so? Maybe because you're too rigid and can't adapt to anything outside your perfect little schedule!,2024-09-03 21:03:09
479,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,At least I have a schedule! Do you even care about our grades?,2024-09-03 21:12:09
480,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Don't lecture me about grades, I'm doing fine without your micromanaging.",2024-09-03 21:16:09
481,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,Fine? Is that why you failed our last group project because you couldn't bother to show up for our meetings?,2024-09-03 21:17:09
482,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,That's rich coming from someone who always treats everyone like they're incompetent!,2024-09-03 21:27:09
483,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,Someone has to step up when others don't!,2024-09-03 21:37:09
484,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Yeah, and stepping up doesn't mean bossing everyone around, Zack!",2024-09-03 21:39:09
485,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,"Maybe if people like you could follow through on commitments, I wouldn't have to be the boss.",2024-09-03 21:45:09
486,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't insufferable, people would actually want to work with you instead of avoiding you like the plague.",2024-09-03 21:50:09
487,escalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,I,2024-09-03 21:59:09
488,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,I can't believe you just took my design without asking!,2024-09-03 20:45:12
489,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,"Your design? Come on, it's just a group project. We all contributed!",2024-09-03 20:48:12
490,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,"No, I spent hours on that logo, and you didn't even mention my name in the presentation!",2024-09-03 20:54:12
491,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,Maybe because I didn't think it was that big of a deal. You're overreacting.,2024-09-03 21:00:12
492,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,"Overreacting? We have to share credit fairly, or what's the point of working as a team?",2024-09-03 21:01:12
493,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,"Well, maybe you should have spoken up during the meeting then instead of crying about it now.",2024-09-03 21:09:12
494,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,I was busy refining the slides since someone didn’t bother to check for errors!,2024-09-03 21:15:12
495,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Typical. Always shifting blame.",2024-09-03 21:17:12
496,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who barely lifts a finger but wants all the glory.,2024-09-03 21:26:12
497,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,"At least I don’t act like a control freak, micromanaging everyone's work.",2024-09-03 21:30:12
498,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,"Maybe if you did your part properly, I wouldn't have to step in all the time.",2024-09-03 21:36:12
499,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,"Whatever. I'm done arguing with you. Just stay out of my way, alright?",2024-09-03 21:43:12
500,escalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,"Fine by me. But don't expect any help from my ""overreacting"" self in the future.",2024-09-03 21:53:12
501,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"You can't just decide the menu without consulting me first, it's a team event!",2024-09-03 20:45:14
502,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to take charge since you're never around for the meetings.",2024-09-03 20:51:14
503,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"I have a job, unlike you. Excuse me for having responsibilities!",2024-09-03 20:58:14
504,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"Oh, please. Don’t act like you’re the only busy person here. We all have lives.",2024-09-03 21:02:14
505,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,Can we focus on the event instead of throwing personal jabs?,2024-09-03 21:09:14
506,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,It’s hard to focus when decisions are made behind my back.,2024-09-03 21:14:14
507,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"Maybe if you showed up, you’d be involved in those decisions!",2024-09-03 21:15:14
508,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. There's no point in arguing about what's already done.,2024-09-03 21:25:14
509,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one constantly being undermined.",2024-09-03 21:27:14
510,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,Undermined? Get over yourself. We're supposed to be working together.,2024-09-03 21:30:14
511,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,We're clearly not getting anywhere like this. We need to set some ground rules.,2024-09-03 21:40:14
512,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,Ground rules? Like not hijacking the planning process?,2024-09-03 21:48:14
513,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,Or like actually showing up so you’re informed?,2024-09-03 21:58:14
514,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,How about we try and split the responsibilities fairly going forward?,2024-09-03 22:05:14
515,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"Fine, but only if we all agree to communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:10:14
516,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"Agreed. But that means being available, not just complaining after the fact.",2024-09-03 22:18:14
517,escalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:28:14
518,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,"You never stick to the plan, that's why our group project is falling apart!",2024-09-03 20:43:17
519,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,"Oh, please. The plan was stupid to begin with. We should've done it my way.",2024-09-03 20:53:17
520,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,Your way? You didn't even bother to read the requirements!,2024-09-03 20:58:17
521,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,That's because I knew your way would fail from the start. It’s just busywork.,2024-09-03 21:00:17
522,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_3,Can both of you stop it? We’re getting nowhere with this argument.,2024-09-03 21:04:17
523,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, you're just as irresponsible. You missed the last two meetings!",2024-09-03 21:06:17
524,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_3,I had valid reasons! Unlike you two who can't agree on anything.,2024-09-03 21:09:17
525,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,And what valid reasons would that be? Watching TV all day?,2024-09-03 21:19:17
526,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_3,"If you have to know, I was taking care of my sick sibling. Not that it's any of your business.",2024-09-03 21:20:17
527,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,That's just an excuse. We all have our issues but we don’t use them to slack off.,2024-09-03 21:24:17
528,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,"Yeah, don't try to play the sympathy card here.",2024-09-03 21:31:17
529,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_3,"Oh, like you care about anyone but yourself. You can't even stick to a decision for more than a day.",2024-09-03 21:40:17
530,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,"And you can't even show up. Next time, why don’t YOU come up with a plan?",2024-09-03 21:42:17
531,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,Fine. But only if you two promise to actually follow it this time.,2024-09-03 21:45:17
532,escalatory_conversation_36,speaker_3,"Sure, but",2024-09-03 21:48:17
533,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for practice yesterday, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:40:20
534,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,"I had something come up, coach. I told Sam to let you know.",2024-09-03 20:47:20
535,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,"That's not good enough. You know how important practice is, especially before a big game.",2024-09-03 20:57:20
536,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_3,It's not like it made a difference. We sucked with or without Alex.,2024-09-03 21:00:20
537,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_4,"Yeah, everyone was struggling. Blaming Alex isn't fair.",2024-09-03 21:09:20
538,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,"Struggling or not, we need every player to be committed. This isn't about just one person.",2024-09-03 21:16:20
539,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,"I'm doing my best, but I have other commitments too!",2024-09-03 21:26:20
540,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_3,"And maybe if other people put in as much effort as Alex, we'd be better off.",2024-09-03 21:31:20
541,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_4,"Honestly, we need to figure out what's wrong with our strategy. Missing one practice isn't the end of the world.",2024-09-03 21:33:20
542,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,The strategy isn't the issue. The problem is the lack of dedication I'm seeing from some of you.,2024-09-03 21:37:20
543,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,"You're always saying that, but never listen to our feedback. Maybe you need to rethink your approach.",2024-09-03 21:47:20
544,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_3,"Yeah, like playing it safe all the time. We need to take more risks or we'll keep losing.",2024-09-03 21:56:20
545,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,So now it's my fault we're losing? I work harder than any of you!,2024-09-03 21:59:20
546,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_4,Maybe we all need to calm down and talk this out instead of blaming each other.,2024-09-03 22:05:20
547,escalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,Right,2024-09-03 22:11:20
548,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 20:48:23
549,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,I told you I had something come up last minute.,2024-09-03 20:52:23
550,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,"Yeah, but it’s the third time in a row. We can't keep covering for you!",2024-09-03 20:57:23
551,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,Covering for me? I’ve been doing my share of the work!,2024-09-03 21:06:23
552,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,Really? Because we haven't seen any of it. Sarah and I had to do your parts.,2024-09-03 21:16:23
553,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_3,He's right. We're all supposed to contribute equally. This isn't fair.,2024-09-03 21:22:23
554,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you’re both ganging up on me? That’s rich.",2024-09-03 21:32:23
555,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_3,"It’s not about ganging up, it’s about getting the work done, which you aren't.",2024-09-03 21:34:23
556,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,"This project is a huge part of our grade. If we fail because of you, that’s on you.",2024-09-03 21:41:23
557,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,"Well maybe if you guys communicated better, this wouldn’t be an issue.",2024-09-03 21:46:23
558,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_3,"Communicate better? We’ve sent you emails, texts, and even called you. What more do you want?",2024-09-03 21:54:23
559,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,I want you to stop acting like I’m the only problem.,2024-09-03 22:04:23
560,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,"If you had showed up, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Simple as that.",2024-09-03 22:11:23
561,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,"You know what, maybe the real issue here is your over-controlling attitude.",2024-09-03 22:18:23
562,escalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,Over-controlling? We need someone,2024-09-03 22:26:23
563,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,Why did you change the project design without telling anyone?,2024-09-03 20:40:26
564,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,Because your design was terrible and wasn't going to work.,2024-09-03 20:43:26
565,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,That’s not your decision to make alone!,2024-09-03 20:52:26
566,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to, because you're too stubborn to listen to better ideas.",2024-09-03 20:59:26
567,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_3,Can you both just stop? We need to figure this out together.,2024-09-03 21:03:26
568,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,We can’t figure anything out if people keep going behind each other’s backs!,2024-09-03 21:10:26
569,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,I did what I had to do. You’re just upset because you’re not always right.,2024-09-03 21:15:26
570,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,"This isn’t about being right, it’s about respect and teamwork!",2024-09-03 21:17:26
571,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_3,"Seriously, can we just take a step back and look at both designs calmly?",2024-09-03 21:18:26
572,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,"How can we, when all speaker_1 does is criticize and shut down my ideas?",2024-09-03 21:26:26
573,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,"That’s not true! I’m willing to discuss, but changes need to be discussed!",2024-09-03 21:34:26
574,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,"Yeah, discussed and then ignored, like every other time.",2024-09-03 21:43:26
575,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_3,Enough! Acting like this won't get us anywhere. Either we talk it through or this project's doomed.,2024-09-03 21:47:26
576,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,"Fine. I’ll listen, but only if speaker_2 agrees to discuss changes before implementing them.",2024-09-03 21:49:26
577,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,I'll agree to that if you promise to actually consider my suggestions.,2024-09-03 21:51:26
578,escalatory_conversation_39,speaker_3,"Okay, we're getting somewhere. Let’s start",2024-09-03 21:58:26
579,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,I can't believe you just gave up mid-way through the hike! We all agreed to finish together.,2024-09-03 20:45:29
580,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,It's not my fault my ankle started hurting! You guys didn't even care enough to check if I was okay.,2024-09-03 20:47:29
581,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,"We asked if you were fine, and you just said, ""I'm good!"" How were we supposed to know?",2024-09-03 20:52:29
582,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. We should have just communicated better.,2024-09-03 20:57:29
583,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's about communication? It was clear as day that we planned to finish this hike!",2024-09-03 21:01:29
584,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,"Stop acting all high and mighty. Not everyone can keep up with your pace, okay?",2024-09-03 21:09:29
585,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,"This is going nowhere. Look, can we just drop this and find a way to move forward?",2024-09-03 21:15:29
586,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,Why should I drop it? They bailed on us without saying anything meaningful!,2024-09-03 21:25:29
587,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,"I've explained a hundred times, my ankle was hurting! You're just too self-centered to listen!",2024-09-03 21:28:29
588,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,This is exactly why we end up fighting every time. No one listens!,2024-09-03 21:35:29
589,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,"Funny, coming from the one who always tries to play the mediator, but never takes a side.",2024-09-03 21:37:29
590,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,"Yeah, you're no better. You just sit on the fence and avoid picking a side.",2024-09-03 21:47:29
591,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,"Maybe if you both weren't so stubborn, we wouldn't need a mediator!",2024-09-03 21:53:29
592,escalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,You know what,2024-09-03 21:54:29
593,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,You always think you're the boss just because you're older!,2024-09-03 20:45:32
594,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,"That's not true, but someone has to keep things in order.",2024-09-03 20:54:32
595,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,Oh really? Is that why you changed the project without even asking me?,2024-09-03 21:01:32
596,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,"I had to! Your ideas were unrealistic, and we're running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:10:32
597,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,Unbelievable! You think you're the only one who knows what's best.,2024-09-03 21:16:32
598,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,At least I'm trying to get things done instead of daydreaming.,2024-09-03 21:20:32
599,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,I was not daydreaming. I was coming up with a creative solution.,2024-09-03 21:22:32
600,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,"Creative or not, it wasn't practical! We need to be realistic.",2024-09-03 21:27:32
601,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,You always shoot down my ideas even before giving them a chance.,2024-09-03 21:37:32
602,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,"Maybe if you listened to constructive criticism, things would be different.",2024-09-03 21:38:32
603,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,Constructive? More like destructive! You never support anything I do.,2024-09-03 21:48:32
604,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,That's because you never take anything seriously!,2024-09-03 21:56:32
605,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,"Maybe if you showed a little respect, I'd take your opinions seriously too.",2024-09-03 21:59:32
606,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,"Respect is earned, not given just because you demand it.",2024-09-03 22:09:32
607,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,Fine. Don't expect any help from me next time you mess up.,2024-09-03 22:10:32
608,escalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,I don't need your help. I can handle things without you.,2024-09-03 22:14:32
609,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,Did you seriously take the last slice of pizza without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 20:47:35
610,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! It's just a slice of pizza. What's the big deal?",2024-09-03 20:52:35
611,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,The big deal is that you always do this. You never think about others!,2024-09-03 20:59:35
612,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,That's not true. I do think about others. Just not every single time!,2024-09-03 21:01:35
613,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_3,"Hey, I noticed the empty box. Anyone want to explain why we're out of pizza already?",2024-09-03 21:03:35
614,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,"Yeah, speaker_2 here decided to take the last slice without checking with anyone.",2024-09-03 21:06:35
615,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,It's not like I knew you were saving it or something!,2024-09-03 21:07:35
616,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_4,"This kind of behavior is getting old. Last time it was finishing the milk, now this?",2024-09-03 21:12:35
617,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,Seriously? Are you guys really that petty? It's just food!,2024-09-03 21:16:35
618,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_3,"It's the principle of it, speaker_2. You're being inconsiderate.",2024-09-03 21:26:35
619,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe I wouldn't be so inconsiderate if you all didn't nag me all the time!,2024-09-03 21:30:35
620,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,We nag because you never listen!,2024-09-03 21:36:35
621,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_4,"And every time we bring something up, you get defensive and turn it into a bigger issue.",2024-09-03 21:39:35
622,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,Maybe it's because you all gang up on me like this!,2024-09-03 21:43:35
623,escalatory_conversation_42,speaker_3,We wouldn't have to if you showed a little more respect for everyone else in this house.,2024-09-03 21:48:35
624,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you changed the project presentation date?,2024-09-03 20:42:37
625,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"You never asked, and I didn't think it would be a big deal.",2024-09-03 20:52:37
626,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,Not a big deal? I missed the presentation because of you!,2024-09-03 20:57:37
627,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,You should have checked the shared calendar like everyone else.,2024-09-03 21:07:37
628,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,"I was out of the office for a week, you knew that!",2024-09-03 21:15:37
629,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,That's not my problem. Everyone is responsible for staying updated.,2024-09-03 21:16:37
630,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,"You could have shot me a quick message, but you didn’t!",2024-09-03 21:20:37
631,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,I’m not your secretary. Handle your own responsibilities.,2024-09-03 21:22:37
632,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,"We're supposed to be a team, but you keep acting like you're alone in this.",2024-09-03 21:27:37
633,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"If being part of a team means babysitting, then count me out.",2024-09-03 21:29:37
634,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,Unbelievable! This is why we never get anything done around here.,2024-09-03 21:38:37
635,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"Maybe if some people were more competent, we wouldn't have these issues!",2024-09-03 21:39:37
636,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,"Competent? At least I show up prepared, unlike you.",2024-09-03 21:46:37
637,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,Prepared? You missed the whole presentation! That's the opposite of prepared.,2024-09-03 21:54:37
638,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,I missed it because of your lack of communication!,2024-09-03 22:02:37
639,escalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"And I’m telling you, it's not my job to keep you informed.",2024-09-03 22:06:37
640,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_1,I can't believe you're blaming me for us losing the project bid.,2024-09-03 20:46:40
641,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,"Well, who else am I supposed to blame? You were supposed to handle the client presentations!",2024-09-03 20:53:40
642,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_1,"And I did! But if someone didn't drop the ball on the financials, maybe we would have had a chance.",2024-09-03 20:56:40
643,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_3,"Hold up, hold up. Are you saying this is my fault now?",2024-09-03 20:59:40
644,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,It's pretty clear that your numbers didn't add up. We looked unprofessional!,2024-09-03 21:07:40
645,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_3,"Excuse me? I triple-checked those figures. Maybe the problem is our so-called ""presentation expert"" wasn't convincing enough.",2024-09-03 21:13:40
646,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who can't even use a basic spreadsheet. Maybe you should stick to simpler tasks.,2024-09-03 21:20:40
647,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,Enough! We need to figure out where we went wrong so this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 21:28:40
648,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_3,"Oh, now you're talking about teamwork after throwing everyone under the bus? Great leadership there.",2024-09-03 21:29:40
649,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,"All I'm saying is we should all take responsibility, but clearly, some of us can't handle that.",2024-09-03 21:36:40
650,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_1,"Responsibility? I was the only one who put in extra hours. What did you do, exactly?",2024-09-03 21:45:40
651,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_3,Worked on financials you people completely ignored until it was too late. Numbers don't win bids; we need to be persuasive!,2024-09-03 21:55:40
652,escalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,"Look, pointing fingers won't fix anything. Just admit you messed up and let's",2024-09-03 21:59:40
653,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,"Why did you mess with my experiment, Sarah? You know how important it is to me!",2024-09-03 20:44:43
654,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,"I didn't mess with it, Tom! I was trying to fix what you did wrong!",2024-09-03 20:49:43
655,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,I did everything right! Now all my data is ruined because you can't keep your hands to yourself!,2024-09-03 20:50:43
656,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,Your data would be meaningless if I hadn't adjusted the variables. You should be thanking me!,2024-09-03 20:55:43
657,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,Thanking you? Are you kidding? You just sabotaged weeks of work!,2024-09-03 20:58:43
658,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,"Sabotaged? If you actually understood what you were doing, you wouldn't need someone to clean up after you!",2024-09-03 21:01:43
659,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,"I'm the one who has been meticulous with this project, unlike you who just waltzes in and changes things on a whim!",2024-09-03 21:09:43
660,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,Meticulous? You mean stubborn! You refuse to listen to any feedback or accept any help!,2024-09-03 21:10:43
661,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,My work was fine without your 'help'! Stay away from my lab station!,2024-09-03 21:11:43
662,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,"Fine? You were going to fail the experiment, and it was supposed to be a group project!",2024-09-03 21:18:43
663,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,"If it's a group project, then stop acting like you're the only one with a clue! You've just made everything worse, again!",2024-09-03 21:23:43
664,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,At least I have the guts to take action instead of just hoping everything will magically work out!,2024-09-03 21:28:43
665,escalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,Guts? More like ego,2024-09-03 21:33:43
666,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't finish the project on time, Alex. This was a group effort!",2024-09-03 20:39:46
667,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,"Oh, sure, just blame me for everything, Sarah. Maybe if you actually helped a bit more, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 20:46:46
668,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,What do you mean? I did my part! You were the one slacking off all week.,2024-09-03 20:51:46
669,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,Slacking off? I was drowning in other assignments. You knew that!,2024-09-03 20:59:46
670,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_3,"Guys, can we please just focus on getting this done? Pointing fingers isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:06:46
671,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Jake. You barely did anything either!",2024-09-03 21:09:46
672,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,"Wow, now you're turning on Jake too? Maybe you're the problem here, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:17:46
673,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_3,"Seriously, we're not going to solve anything by attacking each other. We need solutions, not more arguments.",2024-09-03 21:20:46
674,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,"Fine, but Alex needs to admit that he dropped the ball here.",2024-09-03 21:27:46
675,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,Admit it? Maybe you should admit that your planning was terrible from the start.,2024-09-03 21:33:46
676,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_3,Enough! Blame isn't going to fix anything. How about we split the remaining work and just finish it?,2024-09-03 21:36:46
677,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,"Well, splitting the work again might not be the best idea when some of us don't follow through.",2024-09-03 21:44:46
678,escalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,"Oh come on, here we go again. Maybe if you communicated better, we'd be more on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:46:46
679,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took credit for my ideas in the group project, Claire.",2024-09-03 20:45:49
680,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,"Excuse me? Those ideas were ours; it was a group effort, Kevin.",2024-09-03 20:53:49
681,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"Oh, come on! You know you didn't come up with the main concept. That was all me.",2024-09-03 20:58:49
682,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,And who stayed up late making the presentation look professional? That was me!,2024-09-03 21:08:49
683,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_3,"Hey, guys, can we just focus on finishing the project instead of arguing?",2024-09-03 21:11:49
684,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"It's hard to focus when someone's stealing my work, Emily.",2024-09-03 21:15:49
685,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,"Stealing? That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?",2024-09-03 21:16:49
686,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"Not when it's true, Claire. Give credit where it's due.",2024-09-03 21:26:49
687,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,"I have been working just as hard as you, Kevin, if not harder!",2024-09-03 21:32:49
688,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_3,We're supposed to be a team! This fighting is not helping us.,2024-09-03 21:34:49
689,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"Maybe if Claire didn't act like she did everything, we wouldn't be fighting.",2024-09-03 21:41:49
690,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,"And maybe if you weren't so self-centered, we wouldn't have this problem.",2024-09-03 21:42:49
691,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_4,What is going on here? I can hear you arguing from the other room.,2024-09-03 21:43:49
692,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"Mr. Rogers, Claire is taking credit for my ideas and it's unfair.",2024-09-03 21:52:49
693,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,"That’s not true at all, Mr. Rogers. I’ve put in a lot of effort, too.",2024-09-03 21:53:49
694,escalatory_conversation_47,speaker_4,Regardless,2024-09-03 21:58:49
695,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,Why did you use up all the data this month again?,2024-09-03 20:39:53
696,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. It’s not like you don’t use it too. Why are you always blaming me?",2024-09-03 20:46:53
697,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,Because you're always streaming your stupid videos in HD! You know that eats up data fast!,2024-09-03 20:50:53
698,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,Stupid videos? At least I'm not the one constantly downloading enormous game updates.,2024-09-03 20:52:53
699,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,Those updates are necessary! You don’t need to stream in HD all the time.,2024-09-03 20:56:53
700,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"Oh, and you do need to play every single game that releases a patch, right?",2024-09-03 20:59:53
701,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,At least I’m not glued to my screen 24/7 wasting bandwidth on frivolous nonsense!,2024-09-03 21:00:53
702,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"Frivolous?! You don't even know what I'm watching, so stop pretending you do!",2024-09-03 21:10:53
703,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,"Whatever you're watching, it’s killing our data usage! Can’t you manage it better?",2024-09-03 21:16:53
704,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"Maybe if you stopped gaming all the time, we wouldn’t be hitting the limit every month!",2024-09-03 21:24:53
705,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,I wouldn’t have to game so much if you weren’t so insufferable to live with!,2024-09-03 21:30:53
706,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"Oh, I’m the insufferable one? Look in the mirror, buddy!",2024-09-03 21:38:53
707,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,This isn’t going anywhere. We need a solution.,2024-09-03 21:39:53
708,escalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"Fine, you want a solution? How about you get your own data plan and",2024-09-03 21:45:53
709,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me that you missed the project deadline?,2024-09-03 20:46:57
710,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal. I'll finish it soon.,2024-09-03 20:47:57
711,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,Not a big deal? This was a group project! Now we're all going to get a bad grade because of you.,2024-09-03 20:49:57
712,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_3,"Seriously, we trusted you with the final report, and you just blew it off.",2024-09-03 20:58:57
713,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"I said I'll finish it, alright? Stop ganging up on me.",2024-09-03 21:05:57
714,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,You had two weeks to do it! What were you even doing this whole time?,2024-09-03 21:07:57
715,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"I have other classes too, you know. It's not like this is the only thing on my plate.",2024-09-03 21:15:57
716,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_3,"We all have other classes, but we managed our parts on time. Why couldn't you?",2024-09-03 21:16:57
717,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"I'm not a robot. Sometimes things slip through, okay?",2024-09-03 21:24:57
718,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,"This isn't just about slipping through, it's about responsibility. You didn't even inform us you were behind.",2024-09-03 21:32:57
719,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm irresponsible too? Great, thanks for the vote of confidence.",2024-09-03 21:42:57
720,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_3,"Look, we need to salvage this somehow. Can you finish it by tonight?",2024-09-03 21:47:57
721,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"Tonight? That's impossible now. If you guys are so good at managing, why don’t you help?",2024-09-03 21:54:57
722,escalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,"Maybe we would have, if you communicated like a team member instead of blowing us off. Now,",2024-09-03 22:03:57
723,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"Why didn't you double-check the presentation slides, Alex? We embarrassed ourselves in front of the whole department!",2024-09-03 20:47:01
724,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's my fault now, Sarah? You were the one who was supposed to review the content!",2024-09-03 20:50:01
725,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"I did review it, but I expected you to handle the formatting. That's your job, isn't it?",2024-09-03 20:54:01
726,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,You can't just dump everything on me and expect it to be perfect without any clear communication!,2024-09-03 20:59:01
727,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_3,"Guys, are you both seriously fighting over this? We all had responsibilities and we all dropped the ball.",2024-09-03 21:03:01
728,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"Don't act like you're blameless, Matt. You didn't even show up to the last planning meeting!",2024-09-03 21:08:01
729,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_3,"I had a family emergency, Sarah. You knew that. Give me a break!",2024-09-03 21:12:01
730,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,This is exactly why we can't function as a team. Everyone is just out for themselves!,2024-09-03 21:13:01
731,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"Oh, please. I work harder than anyone else here. Maybe if you both put in half the effort, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:22:01
732,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_3,Harder? You mean micromanaging? That's not the same as being effective.,2024-09-03 21:27:01
733,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"Maybe we need to rethink who leads this project. Clearly, Sarah can't handle it.",2024-09-03 21:36:01
734,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"Don't you dare try to undermine me, Alex. If anyone should step down, it's you!",2024-09-03 21:37:01
735,escalatory_conversation_50,speaker_3,You know what? I'm done.,2024-09-03 21:43:01
736,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,I can't believe you just left the dishes in the sink all weekend.,2024-09-03 20:47:04
737,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault the kitchen's a mess? I wasn't the only one here.",2024-09-03 20:53:04
738,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"Yes, but I specifically asked you to take care of them before your friends came over.",2024-09-03 20:55:04
739,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,And I told you I had too much work to do! You could've done them if it bothered you so much.,2024-09-03 21:01:04
740,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"That's not the point! You've made plans with your friends, you should handle the chores first.",2024-09-03 21:05:04
741,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"Plans? It was just a few friends dropping by, not a big event!",2024-09-03 21:11:04
742,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"Exactly, it wasn't a big deal to wash a couple plates before they arrived.",2024-09-03 21:14:04
743,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,Why are you blowing this out of proportion? It's just dishes!,2024-09-03 21:15:04
744,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"Because it's part of a pattern, you never take responsibility for household chores.",2024-09-03 21:21:04
745,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"Oh, and you think you're so perfect? When was the last time you did laundry, huh?",2024-09-03 21:30:04
746,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,I did the laundry last weekend when you were off having fun.,2024-09-03 21:32:04
747,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"Fun? That was a work event, you knew that!",2024-09-03 21:40:04
748,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"Whatever, the point is, I'm tired of picking up your slack.",2024-09-03 21:48:04
749,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"My slack? If you communicated better, maybe we wouldn't have these problems.",2024-09-03 21:50:04
750,escalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"What do you mean by ""communicate better""? I",2024-09-03 21:59:04
751,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,Why can't you just admit that you messed up the inventory count again?,2024-09-03 20:46:07
752,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,Don't blame me! You know the system is ancient and it glitches all the time.,2024-09-03 20:54:07
753,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,"Ancient or not, it's your responsibility to double-check. We lost a major client because of this mistake!",2024-09-03 21:03:07
754,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually trained people properly, these mistakes wouldn't happen!",2024-09-03 21:08:07
755,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,Everyone just calm down! Finger-pointing isn't going to fix anything.,2024-09-03 21:16:07
756,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, speaker_3. This is between us.",2024-09-03 21:18:07
757,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"Yeah, speaker_3, you’re not the one constantly under pressure here.",2024-09-03 21:23:07
758,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,But blaming each other doesn’t help. Why don't we figure out what went wrong and fix it?,2024-09-03 21:29:07
759,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,We know what went wrong. It's speaker_2's incompetence!,2024-09-03 21:38:07
760,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I’m incompetent? Great leadership, speaker_1. Just fantastic!",2024-09-03 21:43:07
761,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,"You're both acting like children. We need solutions, not more problems.",2024-09-03 21:45:07
762,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,The solution is simple. speaker_2 needs to start taking their job seriously.,2024-09-03 21:49:07
763,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,And maybe speaker_1 needs to stop acting like a dictator and actually provide support.,2024-09-03 21:59:07
764,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,This isn’t getting us anywhere. How about we all take a step back and look at the system together?,2024-09-03 22:02:07
765,escalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,Fine. But I still think speaker_2 needs,2024-09-03 22:08:07
766,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took my laptop without asking, Michael!",2024-09-03 20:43:09
767,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,"Oh come on, Sarah, it's not like you were using it.",2024-09-03 20:45:09
768,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,That's not the point! It's my personal stuff. What if I had important work on there?,2024-09-03 20:52:09
769,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Important work? You mean your video games?,2024-09-03 21:01:09
770,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,That’s none of your business! You always assume the worst!,2024-09-03 21:09:09
771,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Because you never take anything seriously! How am I supposed to trust you with our group project?,2024-09-03 21:18:09
772,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,"Maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't be failing.",2024-09-03 21:28:09
773,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Communicate better? I'm always the one starting our discussion sessions!,2024-09-03 21:30:09
774,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,And then you dominate the conversation and ignore everyone else's ideas!,2024-09-03 21:37:09
775,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Because your ideas are half-baked! They never work in the end!,2024-09-03 21:38:09
776,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,You never even give them a chance! You're so controlling!,2024-09-03 21:45:09
777,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,"Someone has to be! Without me, we'd be totally lost!",2024-09-03 21:55:09
778,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,You're unbelievable. You don't respect anyone else's contributions.,2024-09-03 21:56:09
779,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,"Funny, coming from someone who barely contributes at all.",2024-09-03 22:02:09
780,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,I'm done arguing with you. This isn't getting us anywhere.,2024-09-03 22:11:09
781,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Fine. Maybe I should just finish the project myself.,2024-09-03 22:17:09
782,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,Go ahead. Good luck handling everything on your own.,2024-09-03 22:24:09
783,escalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,At least it won't get screwed up by half-hearted efforts,2024-09-03 22:33:09
784,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"You know, you really should have told me that you were going to submit the group project without showing me the final version.",2024-09-03 20:48:12
785,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault? You didn't even do your part on time!",2024-09-03 20:49:12
786,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"I did my part, but you never communicated when you were putting it all together.",2024-09-03 20:54:12
787,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually checked your messages once in a while, you'd know what was going on.",2024-09-03 20:59:12
788,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"I did check! But seriously, submitting it without even a quick review from me is just irresponsible.",2024-09-03 21:00:12
789,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,"Irresponsible? Look who's talking! You left half your section incomplete, and I had to finish it for you!",2024-09-03 21:01:12
790,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"That's not fair. I did my work, and it was almost done. You could have just asked me instead of taking over.",2024-09-03 21:11:12
791,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,We were running out of time! I didn't have the luxury to wait on you any longer!,2024-09-03 21:12:12
792,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,This is exactly why our group's communication is a mess. You make decisions without consulting anyone.,2024-09-03 21:16:12
793,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,And you expect everything to be spoon-fed to you. Grow up and take some responsibility!,2024-09-03 21:23:12
794,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_3,Can both of you just calm down for a second? This isn't helping us at all!,2024-09-03 21:25:12
795,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you didn't even write a single paragraph for the project!",2024-09-03 21:35:12
796,escalatory_conversation_54,speaker_3,I was busy coordinating the information and making sure our,2024-09-03 21:39:12
797,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting, Tom?",2024-09-03 20:49:22
798,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,"I had other stuff to do, okay? It's not like I missed anything important.",2024-09-03 20:56:22
799,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,"Not important? We divided the tasks, and you just bailed on us. Now we're all behind because of you.",2024-09-03 21:01:22
800,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,"Maybe if someone had bothered to remind me, I would've been there.",2024-09-03 21:07:22
801,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,"Are you serious? We sent a reminder in the group chat, and you even read it!",2024-09-03 21:14:22
802,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,"Well, sorry for not living my life glued to the group chat. I have my own things going on, you know.",2024-09-03 21:16:22
803,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. Arguing isn't helping. Tom, you should've at least let us know you couldn't make it.",2024-09-03 21:17:22
804,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,"And who appointed you the boss of this group, anyway? We all have equal say here.",2024-09-03 21:25:22
805,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,"It's about responsibility, Tom. You promised you'd be there. Now we have to scramble to get everything done on time.",2024-09-03 21:30:22
806,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,Stop acting like I'm the only one who screws up. Remember when you forgot to bring the research materials last week?,2024-09-03 21:34:22
807,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,At least I admitted it and made up for it by doing extra work. You haven't even apologized!,2024-09-03 21:43:22
808,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_3,"Alright, enough. We have to find a solution, not keep score.",2024-09-03 21:46:22
809,escalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,"Fine. But next time,",2024-09-03 21:52:22
810,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"Why did you take the last donut, Greg? You knew I wanted one too.",2024-09-03 20:40:24
811,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"Oh come on, Sarah, you snooze you lose. Get over it.",2024-09-03 20:48:24
812,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,Seriously? That's your excuse? You’re always so selfish.,2024-09-03 20:50:24
813,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,Selfish? You’re the one making a big deal over a donut.,2024-09-03 20:57:24
814,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,It's not about the donut! It's about you never considering anyone else.,2024-09-03 21:04:24
815,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"Well, maybe I wouldn’t have to if you didn’t always complain about everything.",2024-09-03 21:13:24
816,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"I complain because you’re never respectful. Just once, think about other people!",2024-09-03 21:19:24
817,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,And you might want to think about not blowing things out of proportion.,2024-09-03 21:21:24
818,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"Greg, it's not an overreaction to expect common courtesy.",2024-09-03 21:25:24
819,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"Courtesy runs both ways, Sarah. Maybe stop nagging and I’ll start caring.",2024-09-03 21:34:24
820,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,So this is my fault now? Unbelievable.,2024-09-03 21:42:24
821,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,You bet it is. You're unbearable sometimes.,2024-09-03 21:50:24
822,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"Fine, I guess it’s too much to expect any decency from you.",2024-09-03 21:52:24
823,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"And it’s too much to ask for some peace, apparently.",2024-09-03 21:55:24
824,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"Whatever, Greg. This is pointless.",2024-09-03 22:03:24
825,escalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"Finally, something we agree on.",2024-09-03 22:10:24
826,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you moved the project deadline, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:45:27
827,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"I assumed you were keeping track of the emails, Sam. It's not my job to babysit you.",2024-09-03 20:48:27
828,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,Are you serious right now? We are supposed to be working together. How could you not inform me directly?,2024-09-03 20:50:27
829,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. We need to focus on finishing the project, not pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 20:56:27
830,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,"No, Sarah, this is ridiculous! I stayed up all night working with the old deadline in mind.",2024-09-03 21:00:27
831,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"That's not my fault, Sam. Maybe you should check your email more often.",2024-09-03 21:02:27
832,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,Maybe you should be a better team player and communicate!,2024-09-03 21:09:27
833,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_3,Fighting won't get us anywhere. What's done is done. Let's figure out a plan to move forward.,2024-09-03 21:14:27
834,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"We don't have time for this right now. Sam, either get on board or step aside. We can't afford any more delays.",2024-09-03 21:15:27
835,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,"I'm not stepping aside. You need to own up to your lack of communication, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:20:27
836,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"And you need to take responsibility for your own work, Sam!",2024-09-03 21:28:27
837,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_3,Let's just stop this and think about what we need to do next. Can we agree on that?,2024-09-03 21:36:27
838,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,"Fine, but this isn't over. We need to fix our communication issues.",2024-09-03 21:43:27
839,escalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"Agreed. But right now, let's just finish",2024-09-03 21:45:27
840,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up to the group presentation today!,2024-09-03 20:48:32
841,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,Don't put this all on me! You knew I had a family emergency last night.,2024-09-03 20:58:32
842,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,But you didn't even bother to let anyone know! We were all standing there looking clueless.,2024-09-03 21:00:32
843,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_3,"It was really embarrassing for everyone, to be honest. We all had a part to play.",2024-09-03 21:03:32
844,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,So now it's all my fault we flopped? Really? Maybe if someone else had picked up the slack...,2024-09-03 21:06:32
845,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,Pick up the slack? You mean like how we had to rewrite your entire section last week because it was full of mistakes?,2024-09-03 21:16:32
846,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,Maybe it was full of mistakes because none of you were there to help when I asked!,2024-09-03 21:25:32
847,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_3,"We've all been busy, but we managed our time to contribute. Everyone's been stretched thin.",2024-09-03 21:26:32
848,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,"You think I haven't? Just because I had one slip-up, you're all ganging up on me?",2024-09-03 21:33:32
849,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,One slip-up? This isn't the first time you've let us down and you know it.,2024-09-03 21:42:32
850,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,"Oh really, like when?",2024-09-03 21:47:32
851,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,Like when you missed three important meetings because you 'forgot'?,2024-09-03 21:49:32
852,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,I apologized for that! It's not like I did it on purpose.,2024-09-03 21:55:32
853,escalatory_conversation_58,speaker_3,It doesn't matter if it was on purpose or not. We just need everyone to be accountable.,2024-09-03 22:05:32
854,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for team practice yesterday, John?",2024-09-03 20:47:35
855,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,"I had something else to do, okay? It's not like it matters.",2024-09-03 20:53:35
856,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,It does matter! We have a big game coming up and you’re one of our key players.,2024-09-03 21:02:35
857,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,"Maybe if the rest of you practiced harder, it wouldn't all be on me!",2024-09-03 21:04:35
858,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_3,"Seriously, John? We're all busting our butts out there, and you just don't show up?",2024-09-03 21:05:35
859,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Ben. Like you’re so perfect. You miss drills all the time!",2024-09-03 21:08:35
860,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,"That's not fair, John. At least Ben communicates and lets us know if he's going to miss. You just didn't show up.",2024-09-03 21:18:35
861,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,Whatever. Maybe I don’t feel like wasting my time on a team that’s destined to lose.,2024-09-03 21:27:35
862,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,Is that what you think? That we’re going to lose because you’re too important to bother?,2024-09-03 21:30:35
863,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_3,"You know what, John? Maybe you should be the one working harder instead of just complaining about everyone else.",2024-09-03 21:36:35
864,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,"Keep talking, Ben. See if I care. Maybe I should just quit if you all think you're better off without me.",2024-09-03 21:39:35

866,escalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,"Well, maybe I don’t want to be part",2024-09-03 21:49:35
867,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,You didn't even try to pass the ball in the last play!,2024-09-03 20:42:38
868,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,"Are you kidding me? I was wide open, but you hogged it!",2024-09-03 20:51:38
869,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,"Oh please, you were nowhere near open. You just stand around waiting for a miracle.",2024-09-03 20:54:38
870,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,Like you're some superstar? You miss more shots than you make.,2024-09-03 20:57:38
871,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. We're all making mistakes out there.",2024-09-03 21:02:38
872,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, you're not any better with those terrible passes!",2024-09-03 21:10:38
873,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,"Yeah, maybe if you learned to catch, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:14:38
874,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_3,"Maybe if we actually played like a team, we wouldn't be losing so badly.",2024-09-03 21:19:38
875,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,"Oh great, here comes the team lecture. We know how to play, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:27:38
876,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,"If you're so good, then why are we losing by 20 points?",2024-09-03 21:34:38
877,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_3,"How about instead of pointing fingers, we figure out how to fix this?",2024-09-03 21:37:38
878,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,We're losing because some people think they don't have to try.,2024-09-03 21:47:38
879,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,Or maybe because others think they're the only ones who know how to play.,2024-09-03 21:52:38
880,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_3,"Seriously, if we don't work this out, we're going to lose more than just this game.",2024-09-03 21:53:38
881,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,"Fine, what’s your brilliant plan then?",2024-09-03 22:01:38
882,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,"Yeah, enlighten us with your wisdom.",2024-09-03 22:04:38
883,escalatory_conversation_60,speaker_3,How,2024-09-03 22:10:38
884,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my code from the project without asking, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:48:41
885,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,"Because it was full of bugs, Sarah! I had to fix everything.",2024-09-03 20:50:41
886,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,Full of bugs? It was a work in progress! You completely undermined my effort.,2024-09-03 20:52:41
887,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,Undermined? I saved us from a crashing presentation. You should be thanking me.,2024-09-03 20:53:41
888,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,Thanking you? For hacking up my work? You should've communicated before acting.,2024-09-03 21:00:41
889,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,Communicate? Like how you never do? I don’t have time to babysit your messy code.,2024-09-03 21:08:41
890,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"My messy code? You're being arrogant, acting like you're the only competent one here.",2024-09-03 21:18:41
891,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,"Maybe it's because I’m the only one putting in real effort, instead of half-baked attempts!",2024-09-03 21:22:41
892,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop it! This constant fighting is ruining our team's progress.",2024-09-03 21:27:41
893,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"Well, it’s not my fault Alex can’t respect other people's work.",2024-09-03 21:31:41
894,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,"Respect? When you put the whole project at risk with your sloppy work, respect goes out the window.",2024-09-03 21:33:41
895,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_3,"We need to focus on the project outcome, not tearing each other down.",2024-09-03 21:39:41
896,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"I'm focusing, but it seems Alex here only wants control over everything.",2024-09-03 21:47:41
897,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,"No, I want a functioning project, unlike your disaster code.",2024-09-03 21:53:41
898,escalatory_conversation_61,speaker_3,This isn’t helping.,2024-09-03 22:01:41
899,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,Why can't you ever pull your weight on this project?,2024-09-03 20:43:45
900,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I've been doing my part!,2024-09-03 20:53:45
901,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,Really? Because it doesn't seem like it. I had to finish your section last night.,2024-09-03 20:59:45
902,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, you'd see that it was already done.",2024-09-03 21:00:45
903,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,A control freak? I'm just trying to make sure we don't fail this class!,2024-09-03 21:07:45
904,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,And I'm trying to not lose my sanity over your constant micromanaging.,2024-09-03 21:15:45
905,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_3,"Seriously, both of you need to calm down. We're all in this together.",2024-09-03 21:19:45
906,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,Easy for you to say when you're not the one picking up the slack all the time.,2024-09-03 21:28:45
907,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm useless? Thanks for the vote of confidence.",2024-09-03 21:29:45
908,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,If the shoe fits...,2024-09-03 21:30:45
909,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_3,Can we just focus on finishing the project instead of tearing each other apart?,2024-09-03 21:39:45
910,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,Not until she stops acting like she's the only competent one here.,2024-09-03 21:48:45
911,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,Maybe I wouldn't have to if you guys didn't act like children.,2024-09-03 21:50:45
912,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_3,"This is getting us nowhere. We need to work as a team, not as enemies.",2024-09-03 22:00:45
913,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,Tell that to her. She's the one with the superiority complex.,2024-09-03 22:03:45
914,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,And you're the one with the inferiority complex. Grow up.,2024-09-03 22:13:45
915,escalatory_conversation_62,speaker_3,Enough! We're wasting time,2024-09-03 22:16:45
916,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back and talked to the boss, Mark!",2024-09-03 20:44:48
917,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,"Are you serious, Lisa? You were the one who said the project was a team effort!",2024-09-03 20:46:48
918,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,A team effort doesn’t mean throwing me under the bus every chance you get!,2024-09-03 20:56:48
919,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,Throwing you under the bus? I saved the project when you missed the deadline!,2024-09-03 20:59:48
920,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,I didn't miss the deadline! You just didn't bother to check your emails!,2024-09-03 21:08:48
921,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,"If you were actually clear with your communication, I wouldn't have to double-check everything!",2024-09-03 21:13:48
922,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault that you're too lazy to keep up with updates?",2024-09-03 21:19:48
923,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,Lazy? At least I don't spend half the day gossiping and dragging everyone else down!,2024-09-03 21:26:48
924,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,That’s rich coming from someone who spends more time brown-nosing than working!,2024-09-03 21:28:48
925,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,"You know what, Lisa? If you were actually good at your job, you wouldn't have to worry about me talking to the boss!",2024-09-03 21:37:48
926,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,Maybe you should worry more about your own competency rather than sabotaging your teammates!,2024-09-03 21:45:48
927,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,Sabotaging? I’m cleaning up your messes and everyone knows it!,2024-09-03 21:47:48
928,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,Everyone? Or just you and your inflated ego?,2024-09-03 21:51:48
929,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,"My ego? At least I'm confident in my abilities, unlike some people who always need validation!",2024-09-03 22:01:48
930,escalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,Confidence,2024-09-03 22:06:48
931,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball during that last play, Craig?",2024-09-03 20:42:54
932,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,"Because you were out of position, Mia. I had to make a split-second decision.",2024-09-03 20:43:54
933,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,"Out of position? I was right there, wide open!",2024-09-03 20:51:54
934,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,"No, you weren't! You were covered, and I didn't want to risk a turnover.",2024-09-03 21:00:54
935,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on the game instead of arguing?",2024-09-03 21:07:54
936,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,"No, we need to sort this out! Craig always thinks he knows better than everyone else.",2024-09-03 21:15:54
937,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,"Maybe because I actually pay attention during practice, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:21:54
938,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,"Excuse me? I'm always giving my best. Maybe if you learned to trust your teammates, we'd actually win some games.",2024-09-03 21:22:54
939,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,Trust my teammates? How can I trust them when they keep making mistakes?,2024-09-03 21:30:54
940,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_3,This isn't helping. Arguing won't fix anything.,2024-09-03 21:34:54
941,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,Maybe the problem is that Craig thinks he's the only one who can make decisions on the court.,2024-09-03 21:39:54
942,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,And maybe the problem is that some people can't handle constructive criticism!,2024-09-03 21:43:54
943,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_3,"Both of you need to stop. We're a team. We win together, we lose together.",2024-09-03 21:47:54
944,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,Easy for you to say. You're not the one being ignored on the court.,2024-09-03 21:55:54
945,escalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,Ignored? More like saved from making a bad play!,2024-09-03 22:03:54
946,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,"I can't believe you messed up the project presentation slides again, Steven!",2024-09-03 20:49:57
947,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,"Messed up? Olivia, I followed the plan you sent out. Maybe you didn't make it clear enough.",2024-09-03 20:54:57
948,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,Don't put this on me! Everyone else managed just fine. Why is it always you who has an issue?,2024-09-03 20:59:57
949,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't so controlling about every little detail, we wouldn't be having this problem!",2024-09-03 21:04:57
950,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus on fixing this instead of blaming each other?",2024-09-03 21:07:57
951,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,"No, Emily, Steven needs to take responsibility for once.",2024-09-03 21:11:57
952,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,Responsibility? What about the time you forgot to include the budget report? We all covered for you!,2024-09-03 21:21:57
953,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,That was different and you know it!,2024-09-03 21:22:57
954,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_3,Can we please just stop arguing and work on the slides together? We're running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:27:57
955,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,I'm not working with someone who won't admit their own mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:29:57
956,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,"Oh, like you're so perfect! You've been dragging us down since day one.",2024-09-03 21:35:57
957,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_3,This isn't helping! We need to finish this project or we'll all fail.,2024-09-03 21:41:57
958,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,Maybe I should just quit and let you two geniuses handle it.,2024-09-03 21:44:57
959,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,Maybe you should! We'd be better off without your constant screw-ups.,2024-09-03 21:52:57
960,escalatory_conversation_65,speaker_3,Enough! We're all in this together whether we like it or not. Let's divide the tasks,2024-09-03 21:56:57
961,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,I can't believe you bailed on practice again!,2024-09-03 20:46:01
962,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,I didn't bail. I had a family emergency. What did you expect me to do?,2024-09-03 20:48:01
963,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,You could have at least told someone. We were all waiting for you.,2024-09-03 20:50:01
964,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,It's not my fault you can't function without me for one practice.,2024-09-03 20:55:01
965,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping us get any better. We need to figure out a solution.",2024-09-03 20:58:01
966,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,"The solution is that everyone shows up on time, every time!",2024-09-03 21:08:01
967,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the only unreliable one? What about last week when you disappeared for half the session?",2024-09-03 21:18:01
968,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,I had to take care of something important. At least I came back!,2024-09-03 21:26:01
969,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_3,Can we just focus on improving ourselves instead of pointing fingers?,2024-09-03 21:28:01
970,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,Easy for you to say when you're not being blamed for everything!,2024-09-03 21:33:01
971,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,Because I actually care about this team. Unlike some people.,2024-09-03 21:42:01
972,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,"Maybe if you showed a bit more understanding, we wouldn't be losing so many games!",2024-09-03 21:47:01
973,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_3,We're getting nowhere with this. Can we just calm down and talk about our next steps?,2024-09-03 21:50:01
974,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,"Fine. But if this happens again, don't expect me to stay quiet.",2024-09-03 21:51:01
975,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe you should take a look in the mirror before blaming others.,2024-09-03 21:52:01
976,escalatory_conversation_66,speaker_3,"Okay, that's enough. Let's just",2024-09-03 21:53:01
977,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball during that last play, Sarah?",2024-09-03 20:50:04
978,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,"Are you serious, Tony? You weren't even in a good position!",2024-09-03 21:00:04
979,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,I was wide open! You just never see me!,2024-09-03 21:02:04
980,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_3,Can we all just calm down? It's just a game.,2024-09-03 21:04:04
981,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,"No, it's not just a game. This keeps happening every time!",2024-09-03 21:09:04
982,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,"Maybe if you moved around a little more, I'd actually see you!",2024-09-03 21:11:04
983,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault?",2024-09-03 21:20:04
984,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_4,"We need to focus on playing as a team, not blaming each other.",2024-09-03 21:30:04
985,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,Easy for you to say. You're not the one being ignored.,2024-09-03 21:31:04
986,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_4,"And you're not the only one frustrated here, Tony.",2024-09-03 21:35:04
987,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,All I'm saying is I'm tired of feeling like an afterthought.,2024-09-03 21:39:04
988,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_3,This is getting out of hand. Why don't we focus on our next strategy instead?,2024-09-03 21:44:04
989,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,"Fine, but this needs to be addressed. I'm not going to keep playing if this keeps up.",2024-09-03 21:46:04
990,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,Maybe you should learn to pass better then.,2024-09-03 21:51:04
991,escalatory_conversation_67,speaker_4,"Enough! We're not getting anywhere like this. We need to find a way to communicate better, or we'll never win.",2024-09-03 21:55:04
992,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,Why did you tell Coach that I was slacking during practice?,2024-09-03 20:50:07
993,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,Because you were. You didn't even try during the drills.,2024-09-03 20:58:07
994,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,That's not true! I've been giving my best; you just don't notice.,2024-09-03 20:59:07
995,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,"Well, it looked like you barely put any effort in. Maybe you're always this lazy.",2024-09-03 21:02:07
996,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,How dare you call me lazy? I was dealing with an injury and still showed up!,2024-09-03 21:10:07
997,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,"An injury you never mentioned to anyone. Convenient excuse now, don't you think?",2024-09-03 21:20:07
998,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you’re calling me a liar too? What about you skipping practice last week?",2024-09-03 21:30:07
999,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, and everyone knew about it. Nice try deflecting!",2024-09-03 21:34:07
1000,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,You think your excuses are valid and mine aren't? You're such a hypocrite!,2024-09-03 21:40:07
1001,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,At least I communicate with the team. You're just silent and expect sympathy.,2024-09-03 21:47:07
1002,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,I would communicate more if people like you actually listened and believed me.,2024-09-03 21:50:07
1003,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more trustworthy, people would listen. Ever think about that?",2024-09-03 21:51:07
1004,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,Trustworthy? You have no right to talk about trust when you stab teammates in the back!,2024-09-03 22:01:07
1005,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,Oh really? Better than pretending to be a teammate while dragging us down.,2024-09-03 22:11:07
1006,escalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,"I'm dragging us down? I've scored the most points this season, and you",2024-09-03 22:14:07
1007,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,"I can't believe you missed that crucial play, Tom. Were you even paying attention?",2024-09-03 20:45:11
1008,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,"Of course, I was paying attention, Jack! Maybe if you passed the ball more often, we'd actually have a chance to score.",2024-09-03 20:55:11
1009,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,Are you serious? I pass the ball plenty. It's not my fault if you can't handle it.,2024-09-03 20:56:11
1010,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,Handle it? I'm not the one throwing errant passes all over the field. You're the one who needs to work on accuracy.,2024-09-03 20:59:11

1012,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,"Stay out of it, Sarah. Maybe if you defended better, we wouldn't have been in that mess to begin with.",2024-09-03 21:06:11
1013,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_3,"Oh, so now it's my fault too? Typical. Always pointing fingers instead of taking responsibility.",2024-09-03 21:12:11
1014,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,At least Sarah was trying. Unlike some people who just stand there and expect everything to go their way.,2024-09-03 21:19:11
1015,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,"Don't act like you're some hero, Tom. You’re just as responsible for this loss as anyone else.",2024-09-03 21:28:11
1016,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_4,Can we just focus on what we need to improve without tearing each other apart?,2024-09-03 21:29:11
1017,escalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,"Oh great, here comes Coach's pet with the lecture. Just admit you didn't do your part, Jesse.",2024-09-03 21:30:11

1020,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't bother to tell me you were changing the project at the last minute.,2024-09-03 20:50:14
1021,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,What do you mean? I sent an email about it yesterday!,2024-09-03 20:59:14
1022,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,"An email? I was expecting a direct conversation. This is a team project, you know!",2024-09-03 21:07:14
1023,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you actually checked your emails, we wouldn't be having this problem.",2024-09-03 21:14:14
1024,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,"Oh great, now it's my fault that your communication sucks?",2024-09-03 21:15:14

1027,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,We didn't agree on any changes! You're making decisions without consulting anyone!,2024-09-03 21:35:14
1028,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_3,"Seriously, both of you, stop! We're supposed to be working together, not tearing each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:44:14
1029,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one who's constantly being ignored and blamed!",2024-09-03 21:54:14
1030,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,And you're not the one scrambling to fix things because you constantly go rogue!,2024-09-03 22:02:14
1031,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_3,"Look, how about we set a rule that any major changes have to be discussed in a group meeting first?",2024-09-03 22:05:14
1032,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,"Fine, but next time, don't just drop a bombshell through an email.",2024-09-03 22:06:14
1033,escalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,"Agreed. From now on, let's all make sure we're",2024-09-03 22:13:14

1037,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,"I did ask, but you were too busy yelling at the screen to hear me.",2024-09-03 21:06:17
1038,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,That doesn't give you the right to just turn it off! I lost all my progress because of you.,2024-09-03 21:11:17
1039,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't spend all your time playing those stupid games, this wouldn't happen.",2024-09-03 21:13:17
1040,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,Stupid games? What about your dumb reality TV shows? They're a waste of time too.,2024-09-03 21:15:17
1041,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,"Oh, so now my shows are the problem? At least they don't consume my entire life.",2024-09-03 21:20:17
1042,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,"Well, at least my games actually challenge my brain, unlike your mind-numbing trash.",2024-09-03 21:29:17
1043,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,Don't act all high and mighty. You neglect everything else just for those games.,2024-09-03 21:39:17
1044,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,And you don't? How about the time you missed dinner because of that ridiculous marathon?,2024-09-03 21:41:17
1045,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,That was one time! You skip meals every other day because you're glued to that console.,2024-09-03 21:42:17
1046,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,"Look, if you had just talked to me instead of acting like a tyrant, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:47:17
1047,escalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,Talked to you? You mean yell over the,2024-09-03 21:48:17
1048,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,"Why didn't you complete your section of the group project, Jamie?",2024-09-03 20:46:20
1049,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"Seriously, Alex, I've been swamped with other tests and assignments! I told you this.",2024-09-03 20:51:20
1050,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,We all have other things going on! That's not an excuse to let us down.,2024-09-03 21:00:20

1052,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,"No, Sam, this isn't just about finishing. Jamie's negligence is impacting our grades!",2024-09-03 21:14:20
1053,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"Negligence? Are you kidding me? I did the research, but no one bothered to look at it.",2024-09-03 21:17:20
1054,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_4,Both of you need to take a step back and talk this through reasonably.,2024-09-03 21:24:20
1055,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,But it's always Jamie who drops the ball when it matters most.,2024-09-03 21:33:20
1056,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"And it's always you, Alex, that's overly controlling and never satisfied with other people's work!",2024-09-03 21:40:20
1057,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,"Well, sorry for wanting to get an A!",2024-09-03 21:44:20
1058,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_3,Can we just focus on what's left to do?,2024-09-03 21:51:20
1059,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"Fine. But if you can't appreciate the work I've already put in, I'm out.",2024-09-03 21:57:20
1060,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,Good luck trying to do it all on your own and still pass.,2024-09-03 22:00:20
1061,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_4,Enough! Let's just delegate the remaining tasks and get it done.,2024-09-03 22:05:20
1062,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_3,"Jamie, if you have the research, share it now so we can complete our sections.",2024-09-03 22:15:20
1063,escalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,I'll send the files,2024-09-03 22:25:20
1064,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,Why did you take my design and present it as your own in the meeting today?,2024-09-03 20:46:22
1065,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,I didn't take anything; we were supposed to be working on this together.,2024-09-03 20:53:22
1066,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,Collaborating doesn't mean you get to steal credit for my ideas.,2024-09-03 20:54:22
1067,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,"Steal credit? I refined what you started. If it weren't for me, it wouldn't even be presentable.",2024-09-03 21:01:22
1068,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,"That's not true! I spent days working on those diagrams, and you know it!",2024-09-03 21:09:22
1069,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,And I spent nights making sure your half-baked concept didn't flop in front of the board.,2024-09-03 21:15:22
1070,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,You could have at least acknowledged my contribution instead of acting like it was all your work!,2024-09-03 21:22:22
1071,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you want a participation trophy? Grow up!",2024-09-03 21:26:22
1072,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,This isn't about recognition; it's about respect and integrity!,2024-09-03 21:30:22
1073,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,You want respect? Then actually listen to feedback instead of getting defensive all the time!,2024-09-03 21:35:22
1074,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,"Feedback is one thing, taking over is another. You completely undermined me!",2024-09-03 21:45:22
1075,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,Maybe because your stubbornness is undermining the whole project's success!,2024-09-03 21:55:22
1076,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,"If you think you're the only one who cares about this project, you're sorely mistaken.",2024-09-03 22:04:22
1077,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,Care about the project? All you care about is your ego and getting praise!,2024-09-03 22:10:22
1078,escalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,That's ridiculous and you know it! All I want is acknowledgement for what,2024-09-03 22:13:22
1079,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up to the rehearsal again, Mark.",2024-09-03 20:44:25
1080,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,"Look, I had something come up. It's not like I missed it on purpose.",2024-09-03 20:51:25
1081,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,Something always comes up with you! We're trying to prepare for a performance here!,2024-09-03 21:00:25
1082,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't such a control freak, I'd be more inclined to come.",2024-09-03 21:08:25
1083,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_3,"Guys, let's calm down. We all want this performance to be great.",2024-09-03 21:15:25
1084,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Sarah. You don't have to deal with Mark's constant flakiness.",2024-09-03 21:25:25
1085,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Maybe if you showed a little more respect, I'd take this more seriously.",2024-09-03 21:30:25
1086,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,Respect? When have you ever given me a reason to respect you?,2024-09-03 21:40:25
1087,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_3,Can we just focus on finding a solution instead of pointing fingers?,2024-09-03 21:43:25
1088,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,There is no solution because James here thinks he's the boss of everyone.,2024-09-03 21:46:25
1089,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,"Someone has to take charge, especially when you can't even bother to show up!",2024-09-03 21:47:25
1090,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,"I can't deal with this right now. You know what, maybe I shouldn't even be part of this band.",2024-09-03 21:57:25
1091,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,"Maybe you shouldn't, if you're not going to commit!",2024-09-03 22:00:25
1092,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_3,"Alright, enough! This is getting us nowhere. We need to either work this out or make a decision fast.",2024-09-03 22:02:25
1093,escalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,"Fine,",2024-09-03 22:03:25
1094,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the last play?,2024-09-03 20:49:28
1095,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,Are you serious? You were miles away from the goal!,2024-09-03 20:59:28
1096,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,I was in a better position than you! You always have to be the hero.,2024-09-03 21:02:28
1097,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault we’re losing? Maybe if you practiced more, you'd be where you needed to be.",2024-09-03 21:03:28
1098,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus on the game instead of fighting each other?",2024-09-03 21:05:28
1099,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, speaker_3! This is between me and speaker_2.",2024-09-03 21:14:28
1100,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,"No, let him speak! Maybe he has some insights since you clearly have no idea how to play as a team.",2024-09-03 21:19:28
1101,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,That's rich coming from the guy who missed three shots today!,2024-09-03 21:25:28
1102,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_3,"Look, blaming each other isn't helping. We need to come together and figure out a strategy.",2024-09-03 21:33:28
1103,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,"Fine, what do you suggest then, Mr. Know-it-all?",2024-09-03 21:36:28
1104,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_3,We need to communicate better and actually pass the ball instead of trying to do everything solo.,2024-09-03 21:40:28
1105,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,"Agreed. But that goes for all of us, especially you, speaker_1.",2024-09-03 21:49:28
1106,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,"Fine, I get it. But next time, trust that I know what I'm doing too.",2024-09-03 21:57:28
1107,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,"Alright, but let's make sure we're clear about who's doing what. No more guessing.",2024-09-03 22:00:28
1108,escalatory_conversation_75,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:09:28
1109,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass the ball to me? I was wide open!,2024-09-03 20:48:32
1110,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,"I didn't see you, okay? Stop blaming me every single time we lose!",2024-09-03 20:54:32
1111,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,This isn't about one loss! You never see anyone but yourself on the court!,2024-09-03 21:03:32
1112,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus on fixing this instead of pointing fingers?",2024-09-03 21:11:32
1113,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if some people had better teamwork, there wouldn't be anything to fix!",2024-09-03 21:16:32
1114,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's all on me? You're the one who hogs the ball!",2024-09-03 21:22:32
1115,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_4,"Seriously, can you both stop it? We're losing because everyone's playing selfishly, not just one person.",2024-09-03 21:31:32
1116,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,I'm not the one who missed an open shot last game!,2024-09-03 21:33:32
1117,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,And I wouldn't have to take that shot if you actually trusted your teammates!,2024-09-03 21:42:32
1118,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_3,This isn't helping anyone! Let's talk strategies instead of blaming.,2024-09-03 21:43:32
1119,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_4,"Yeah, we need to work on communication and trust, or we'll keep losing.",2024-09-03 21:45:32

1123,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,"Agreed, but some people really need to change their mindset.",2024-09-03 22:11:32
1124,escalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,Maybe you should start with yourself.,2024-09-03 22:21:32
1125,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting last night?,2024-09-03 20:43:35

1130,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,Respect? You've been flaking out this entire time. How am I supposed to respect that?,2024-09-03 21:09:35
1131,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,Flaking out? That's rich coming from you. You haven't even been holding up your end of the work.,2024-09-03 21:10:35
1132,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,Excuse me? I've done more than both of you combined!,2024-09-03 21:18:35

1134,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,Solution? Fine. How about you both stop micromanaging everything?,2024-09-03 21:28:35
1135,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,"Micromanaging? Someone has to because clearly, you won't.",2024-09-03 21:34:35
1136,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn't helping. We need to split up the workload fairly and get this done. Otherwise, we'll all fail.",2024-09-03 21:36:35
1137,escalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,"I'm tired of this. You know what, just give me my part, and I'll do it on my own.",2024-09-03 21:45:35

1142,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,"Oh please, don't lecture me. You're not exactly perfect either. Remember when you missed practice last month?",2024-09-03 21:01:38
1143,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,That was once! You’ve skipped like five practices in a row!,2024-09-03 21:05:38
1144,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. We need to talk about how to fix this.",2024-09-03 21:12:38
1145,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,"See, even Mark gets it. You're always blowing things out of proportion, Jenna.",2024-09-03 21:18:38

1147,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,Maybe the band wouldn't be falling apart if you weren’t such a control freak!,2024-09-03 21:27:38
1148,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,Control freak? I’m the only one holding this together while you just coast by!,2024-09-03 21:28:38
1149,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't need to coast if you weren't so overbearing all the time!,2024-09-03 21:29:38
1150,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_3,Can we please just figure out a way to stay on track? Fighting won't solve anything.,2024-09-03 21:33:38
1151,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,"Mark's right, but I can't just ignore Alex’s complete lack of dedication.",2024-09-03 21:37:38
1152,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,And I can't deal with Jenna bossing everyone around like she owns the place.,2024-09-03 21:39:38
1153,escalatory_conversation_78,speaker_3,"This isn't going anywhere. We need a solution, not",2024-09-03 21:46:38
1154,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,I can't believe you replaced me as the project lead without even talking to me first.,2024-09-03 20:43:41
1155,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,"Because you weren't getting things done! The deadline is next week, and we were falling behind.",2024-09-03 20:49:41
1156,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_3,"But, speaker_2, it would have been better to discuss it openly instead of making a unilateral decision.",2024-09-03 20:55:41
1157,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,Open discussion? We don't have time for endless debates. We needed action.,2024-09-03 20:57:41
1158,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,Action? All you did was create more chaos. Now no one knows who to report to!,2024-09-03 20:59:41
1159,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_4,"Honestly, speaker_2, I feel left out too. We should have all been in the loop.",2024-09-03 21:06:41
1160,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,"Seriously? If I looped everyone in, we'd still be arguing instead of working. This project isn't about feelings; it's about results.",2024-09-03 21:16:41
1161,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_3,Results come from teamwork and trust. You've just shattered both.,2024-09-03 21:24:41
1162,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because our ""teamwork"" was so effective so far?",2024-09-03 21:32:41
1163,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,It might have been if you'd communicated! You made an executive decision without consulting anyone. That's not leadership.,2024-09-03 21:41:41
1164,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_4,And now we're divided. How is that helping our deadline?,2024-09-03 21:44:41
1165,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I rushed it. But at least I did something instead of just talking about it.",2024-09-03 21:46:41
1166,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_3,Doing something doesn't mean doing the right thing. We need to fix this by getting back on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:52:41
1167,escalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,And,2024-09-03 21:57:41
1168,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,I can't believe you just left the group project halfway through. What were you thinking?,2024-09-03 20:50:43
1169,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's all on me now? You never even showed up for the meetings!",2024-09-03 20:53:43
1170,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. We need to sort this out. Pointing fingers isn't going to help.",2024-09-03 21:02:43
1171,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,Calm down? We're behind because of you both!,2024-09-03 21:05:43
1172,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,Are you serious? I've been doing all the research while you did nothing!,2024-09-03 21:13:43
1173,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,This isn't helping. Accusations aren't getting us anywhere. Let's just assign tasks and get back on track.,2024-09-03 21:18:43
1174,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you barely did any work!",2024-09-03 21:23:43
1175,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,"Yeah, deflect the blame. Typical of you.",2024-09-03 21:26:43
1176,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,This is ridiculous. How about we just cancel the whole project if no one wants to contribute effectively?,2024-09-03 21:29:43
1177,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,"Oh, now you're quitting too? Great, just great.",2024-09-03 21:32:43
1178,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,Maybe it would be better. No one is cooperating anyway.,2024-09-03 21:33:43
1179,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,"Fine, let's see how we tell the professor we're dropping out. Good luck explaining yourselves!",2024-09-03 21:37:43
1180,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,Don't you dare drag me into this. I'm not taking the fall for your laziness.,2024-09-03 21:45:43
1181,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,"Same here. If we fail, it's on all of us, not just me!",2024-09-03 21:53:43
1182,escalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,This isn't going anywhere. Meeting adjourned. Figure it out yourselves.,2024-09-03 21:59:43
1183,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,"I can't believe you messed up the presentation, Aaron. We've been working on it for months!",2024-09-03 20:49:46
1184,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,"Messed up? Are you serious, Emma? You're the one who added those pointless slides at the last minute.",2024-09-03 20:59:46
1185,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,Pointless? They were crucial statistics! You ignored all my suggestions for improving the flow!,2024-09-03 21:07:46
1186,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_3,"Guys, can we calm down and figure out a solution? Pointing fingers won't help.",2024-09-03 21:15:46
1187,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,"Stay out of this, Mike. Emma needs to take responsibility for her mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:19:46
1188,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,My mistakes? You barely did any work! I had to cover for you multiple times!,2024-09-03 21:23:46
1189,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_4,"If this is how we're handling teamwork, no wonder our project is falling apart.",2024-09-03 21:27:46
1190,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if we had better leadership, it wouldn't be such a disaster.",2024-09-03 21:30:46
1191,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're blaming my leadership skills? Look at yourself first!",2024-09-03 21:40:46
1192,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_3,This isn't getting us anywhere. We need to focus on fixing the errors before the final review.,2024-09-03 21:49:46
1193,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,"Fixing your errors, you mean. I'm done cleaning up your mess.",2024-09-03 21:57:46
1194,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_4,Enough! We won't get anything done if we keep this up. We need to act like a team.,2024-09-03 22:02:46
1195,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,"Acting like a team means everyone does their part, Aaron. Clearly, you don't understand that.",2024-09-03 22:06:46
1196,escalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,And maybe you need to understand that your controlling nature is,2024-09-03 22:08:46
1197,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted that group project without even asking us first!,2024-09-03 20:50:49
1198,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,"What's the big deal? Someone had to do it, and none of you were stepping up.",2024-09-03 20:55:49
1199,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_3,The big deal is that you didn't include half of our work! We spent hours on those sections.,2024-09-03 21:05:49
1200,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,Exactly! You made us look like we didn't contribute at all.,2024-09-03 21:09:49
1201,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,"Maybe if your work was up to standard, I wouldn't have to make these decisions on my own.",2024-09-03 21:11:49
1202,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,That's ridiculous! You've got no right to judge our work.,2024-09-03 21:16:49
1203,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_3,And now we're stuck with a poor grade because you thought you knew better than everyone else.,2024-09-03 21:21:49
1204,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you guys communicated better, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:31:49
1205,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,"Communicate better? We had a group chat, email threads, and we even had meetings! You ignored all of that!",2024-09-03 21:32:49
1206,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_3,This isn't just about communication—it's about respect. You completely disrespected our efforts.,2024-09-03 21:39:49
1207,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,I'm not going to apologize for making sure we didn't fail completely. I did what had to be done.,2024-09-03 21:46:49
1208,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're the hero? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:47:49
1209,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_3,"This so-called ""hero"" act is what got us into trouble in the first place. If you'd have just listened, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:50:49
1210,escalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,Maybe if you two,2024-09-03 21:52:49
1211,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,Why did you change the project design without consulting me first?,2024-09-03 20:41:52
1212,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"I thought it needed improvement. Besides, you were unreachable all weekend.",2024-09-03 20:44:52
1213,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,That doesn't mean you can just make unilateral decisions!,2024-09-03 20:48:52
1214,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to do something. Your design was too basic.",2024-09-03 20:58:52
1215,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,"Too basic? I worked hard on that design, and it met all the requirements.",2024-09-03 21:06:52
1216,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,Hard isn't enough. It lacked creativity and would have bored the client!,2024-09-03 21:08:52
1217,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,You know what lacks creativity? Constantly undermining my work.,2024-09-03 21:17:52
1218,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"Undermining? If I didn't step in, our project would have been a disaster!",2024-09-03 21:26:52
1219,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,So now you're the hero? Get over yourself.,2024-09-03 21:29:52
1220,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,At least I'm trying to save our faces in front of the client!,2024-09-03 21:30:52
1221,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,Save our faces? More like put on a show to make yourself look good.,2024-09-03 21:32:52
1222,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"It's called taking initiative, something you could learn.",2024-09-03 21:39:52
1223,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,Initiative doesn't mean disrespecting your teammate's efforts.,2024-09-03 21:43:52
1224,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't have to if you actually took constructive criticism.,2024-09-03 21:51:52
1225,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,Constructive? More like destructive criticism. You never acknowledge anything I do right!,2024-09-03 21:54:52
1226,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,Maybe there's nothing to acknowledge. Your work ethic needs serious improvement.,2024-09-03 22:04:52
1227,escalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,This isn't about my work ethic. It's about your constant need to control everything.,2024-09-03 22:05:52
1228,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_1,"You always take over the group projects without asking for our input, Sarah.",2024-09-03 20:46:55
1229,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,"That's because no one else ever steps up! If I didn't, nothing would get done, Mike.",2024-09-03 20:50:55
1230,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_3,"Maybe if you gave us a chance, we'd actually be able to contribute, Sarah.",2024-09-03 20:57:55
1231,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,"I've tried! But every time I ask, everyone just stares blankly at me. What am I supposed to do?",2024-09-03 20:59:55
1232,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_4,"It's not that we're blank, it's that you steamroll over any suggestions the moment we make them.",2024-09-03 21:06:55
1233,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,I don't steamroll! I just know what needs to be done to get a good grade.,2024-09-03 21:15:55
1234,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_1,"That's the problem, Sarah. You're more focused on the grade than on actually working as a team.",2024-09-03 21:23:55
1235,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,"And is that such a bad thing? If we get a good grade, everyone benefits, right?",2024-09-03 21:24:55
1236,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_3,Except we're not learning anything because we're not involved in the process at all.,2024-09-03 21:34:55
1237,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_4,"Yeah, it's not just about the grade. It's about the experience and learning how to work together.",2024-09-03 21:38:55
1238,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,"Fine, then tell me: What brilliant ideas do any of you have that I've supposedly ignored?",2024-09-03 21:41:55
1239,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_1,"Last time, I suggested we divide the work equally so everyone had a part, and you shot it down immediately.",2024-09-03 21:45:55
1240,escalatory_conversation_84,speaker_3,"And I proposed we brainstorm together before starting, but you said it was a",2024-09-03 21:52:55
1241,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,"Why did you use my camera without asking, Chris?",2024-09-03 20:47:59
1242,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"I didn't think you'd mind, Alex! It's not a big deal.",2024-09-03 20:48:59
1243,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,"Of course it's a big deal! It's my camera, and I need to know where it is.",2024-09-03 20:54:59
1244,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"You always overreact! It was just for an hour, calm down.",2024-09-03 21:00:59
1245,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,"Overreact? It's called respecting someone's property, Chris.",2024-09-03 21:05:59
1246,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"I respect your property, but it wasn't even gone that long!",2024-09-03 21:14:59
1247,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,"That's not the point. You should have asked first, especially given that I needed it today.",2024-09-03 21:15:59
1248,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"Needed it today? You always have it lying around, unused. Why does it matter so much now?",2024-09-03 21:25:59
1249,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,Because I had a project to shoot for my class! Now I'm behind because I couldn't find it!,2024-09-03 21:32:59
1250,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"Oh, now it's my fault you're behind? Maybe you should plan better.",2024-09-03 21:40:59
1251,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,Planning better wouldn't matter if I can't find my stuff because you're using it without permission!,2024-09-03 21:48:59
1252,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"You know what, I've had enough of this. Just let it go, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:52:59
1253,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,Let it go? Not until you promise to ask next time!,2024-09-03 21:59:59
1254,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"Fine, whatever. Next time, I'll ask. Happy now?",2024-09-03 22:05:59
1255,escalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,Barely. But at least it's a start.,2024-09-03 22:07:59
1256,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back and took credit for my project idea with the boss, Alex.",2024-09-03 20:45:02
1257,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,Are you serious? I only did that because you never include me in any important tasks. How else was I supposed to prove myself?,2024-09-03 20:47:02
1258,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,Prove yourself? By betraying your own teammate? That's messed up.,2024-09-03 20:55:02
1259,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"Teammate? More like bossy leader. You never listen to anyone else's ideas, let alone give credit.",2024-09-03 21:01:02
1260,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,"If you had better ideas, maybe I would. Your work has been sloppy lately, and we can't afford that in this high-profile project.",2024-09-03 21:05:02
1261,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"Sloppy? You've become a perfectionist to the point of insanity. No one's perfect, not even you.",2024-09-03 21:11:02
1262,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,Taking shortcuts and backstabbing isn't about being perfect; it's about ethics and team trust.,2024-09-03 21:14:02
1263,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"You're one to talk about ethics. Didn't you, just last month, present my outline to the client without even mentioning me?",2024-09-03 21:22:02
1264,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,"That was different. You didn't show up to the meeting, and I had to improvise. Stop making excuses for your betrayal.",2024-09-03 21:32:02
1265,escalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"No, that's exactly the same! You never gave me a chance to explain, just like you're not listening now!",2024-09-03 21:33:02

1267,escalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,You always do this! Why can't you follow the team strategy for once?,2024-09-03 20:47:06
1268,escalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,The team strategy is flawed; it won't work against a team as strong as ours!,2024-09-03 20:53:06

1281,escalatory_conversation_87,speaker_3,Can we focus on the game? The opponents are pulling ahead!,2024-09-03 22:16:06
1282,escalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,Focus on your rigid plan while we keep losing. Great idea!,2024-09-03 22:24:06

1286,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,I was trying to help you! It looked like you needed it.,2024-09-03 20:53:09
1287,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,Help? More like you ruined it. Now I have to start all over!,2024-09-03 21:03:09
1288,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,I didn't ruin anything. I improved it. Your design was flawed.,2024-09-03 21:09:09

1295,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,Solving it? The problem is right here. He can't stay out of my work.,2024-09-03 21:54:09
1296,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,"Your work? Newsflash, this is a group project. Learn to collaborate.",2024-09-03 22:01:09
1297,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_3,"Enough! Both of you, we need to discuss this rationally.",2024-09-03 22:07:09
1298,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,What's there to discuss? He doesn't respect my contributions!,2024-09-03 22:11:09
1299,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,Respect goes both ways. Maybe you should learn to take some advice.,2024-09-03 22:16:09
1300,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_3,We're not getting anywhere like this. Can we please just—,2024-09-03 22:20:09
1301,escalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,Don't even bother. I don't,2024-09-03 22:24:09
1302,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were going to miss our presentation today?,2024-09-03 20:45:12
1303,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal! You could handle it, couldn't you?",2024-09-03 20:52:12
1304,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,Of course it's a big deal! We were supposed to do it together. You can't just bail last minute!,2024-09-03 20:54:12
1305,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren’t so controlling, I would feel comfortable sharing things with you.",2024-09-03 21:03:12
1306,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,Controlling? Or am I just making sure everything goes smoothly because you never step up?,2024-09-03 21:12:12
1307,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,"That's not fair! I have my own commitments, you know. Not everything revolves around your precious schedule.",2024-09-03 21:15:12
1308,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,"If you can't prioritize our project, maybe you shouldn't be a part of it in the first place.",2024-09-03 21:22:12
1309,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,Maybe I shouldn't be! At least I wouldn't have to deal with your constant nagging.,2024-09-03 21:25:12
1310,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,"Nagging? It's called responsibility, something you clearly don't understand.",2024-09-03 21:29:12
1311,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,"Oh, and you're the epitome of responsibility? What about last week when you forgot to email our teacher?",2024-09-03 21:30:12
1312,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,That was one time! And I admitted I made a mistake. At least I was there to present.,2024-09-03 21:38:12
1313,escalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,"You always have an excuse, don’t you? Just like you're always right in your own eyes, aren't you?",2024-09-03 21:46:12

1316,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 20:46:15
1317,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,I had something come up. I thought I told you.,2024-09-03 20:51:15
1318,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,"No, you didn't. And now we’re behind schedule.",2024-09-03 20:56:15
1319,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you were better at communicating, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:01:15
1320,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,Excuse me? I'm always the one organizing everything.,2024-09-03 21:02:15
1321,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"Exactly, and you’re terrible at it.",2024-09-03 21:11:15
1322,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_3,"Hey, can we just focus on what needs to be done?",2024-09-03 21:19:15
1323,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,"No, we need to address this. We can't keep having people skip meetings.",2024-09-03 21:22:15
1324,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,I'm not the only one who hasn’t shown up before!,2024-09-03 21:32:15
1325,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,But you're the one doing it consistently.,2024-09-03 21:33:15
1326,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_3,"This isn't helping. We have deadlines, remember?",2024-09-03 21:43:15
1327,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"Maybe if speaker_1 wasn't such a dictator, people would want to come to the meetings.",2024-09-03 21:51:15
1328,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,"Oh, so it's my fault now?",2024-09-03 21:58:15
1329,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"Yes, because you make everything so stressful.",2024-09-03 22:04:15
1330,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_3,Can you both stop? We're wasting time.,2024-09-03 22:06:15
1331,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"Whatever. Maybe you should lead then, speaker_3.",2024-09-03 22:09:15
1332,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_3,That’s not the point. The point is to finish the project on time.,2024-09-03 22:15:15
1333,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,"Yeah, good luck with that if people keep bailing.",2024-09-03 22:25:15
1334,escalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,I’m done with this conversation.,2024-09-03 22:26:15
1335,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,Why did you take credit for the presentation slides I created?,2024-09-03 20:51:18
1336,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I made those slides better. You should be thanking me.,2024-09-03 20:56:18
1337,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,Better? You just added a few colors and changed the font. It was my research and content.,2024-09-03 20:57:18
1338,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you made your slides visually appealing in the first place, I wouldn’t have had to do it.",2024-09-03 21:06:18
1339,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,Visually appealing? Are you serious? The content is what matters the most!,2024-09-03 21:16:18
1340,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"If people can't stand to look at your slides, they won’t even bother with the content!",2024-09-03 21:24:18
1341,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,That’s not the point! You didn’t even mention my name during the presentation. You took all the credit!,2024-09-03 21:31:18
1342,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,Why should I? I improved them. They’re half mine at this point.,2024-09-03 21:37:18
1343,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,Half yours? You barely did anything! How can you justify that?,2024-09-03 21:46:18
1344,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"If you can’t handle teamwork and someone adding value to your work, maybe you shouldn’t be collaborating with others.",2024-09-03 21:53:18
1345,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,"Oh, so now I have to be grateful to you for stealing my work and claiming it as yours?",2024-09-03 21:54:18
1346,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"Stealing? This is ridiculous! I didn’t steal anything. It was a team effort, and you’re just upset you didn’t get all the glory.",2024-09-03 21:59:18
1347,escalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,Team effort? You didn’t even ask if I,2024-09-03 22:08:18
1348,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball when I was wide open?,2024-09-03 20:42:21
1349,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,Because you always hog the ball and then miss the shot!,2024-09-03 20:47:21
1350,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,That's not true! I make more shots than you do!,2024-09-03 20:56:21
1351,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually passed once in a while, we wouldn't be losing every game!",2024-09-03 21:04:21
1352,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_3,"Guys, stop it. We're supposed to be a team.",2024-09-03 21:11:21
1353,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,Tell that to him! He never wants to include me in plays.,2024-09-03 21:17:21
1354,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,"Oh, please. You never look for anyone else on the court.",2024-09-03 21:20:21
1355,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_3,Enough! This isn't helping us win any games.,2024-09-03 21:25:21
1356,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if we had a coach who actually gave us good strategies, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:31:21
1357,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_4,Excuse me? Are you blaming me for your lack of teamwork?,2024-09-03 21:33:21
1358,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,He has a point. Your plays are outdated and easy to defend against.,2024-09-03 21:37:21
1359,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_4,My plays aren't the problem; your attitudes are.,2024-09-03 21:46:21
1360,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,"See, now it's all our fault! Typical.",2024-09-03 21:50:21
1361,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_3,We really need to work on our communication instead of blaming each other.,2024-09-03 21:59:21
1362,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,"That's easy for you to say, you're not the one getting ignored on the court!",2024-09-03 22:02:21
1363,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_4,"If you all don't start acting like a team, I'll bench every single one of you.",2024-09-03 22:09:21
1364,escalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,Maybe we should find a coach who actually,2024-09-03 22:15:21
1365,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,"Why can't you just admit you broke the vase, Emily?",2024-09-03 20:45:24
1366,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,"Are you serious, Jake? You think I would break something and not tell anyone?",2024-09-03 20:52:24
1367,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,"Every time something goes wrong, you're always around. It's obvious.",2024-09-03 20:54:24
1368,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're blaming me for everything that happens in this house?",2024-09-03 21:02:24
1369,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,"I'm not blaming you for everything, just the things you mess up and lie about!",2024-09-03 21:10:24
1370,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,"I haven't lied about anything, Jake! Stop making stuff up to get me in trouble.",2024-09-03 21:12:24
1371,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop it. This is getting ridiculous. We need to handle this like adults.",2024-09-03 21:21:24
1372,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, Dad. Emily has to own up to her mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:25:24
1373,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,"I don't have to listen to this garbage. If I broke the vase, I'd say so. Maybe you should check your temper.",2024-09-03 21:28:24
1374,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_3,"Jake, accusing won't help. And Emily, it's clear you're getting defensive. Let's just find a solution.",2024-09-03 21:29:24
1375,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,"Defensiveness is an admission of guilt, if you ask me.",2024-09-03 21:33:24
1376,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,Or maybe I'm just sick of being falsely accused all the time!,2024-09-03 21:42:24
1377,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_3,"Alright, enough. We’re all family here. Let's calm down and figure out how this happened without all the shouting.",2024-09-03 21:51:24
1378,escalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,Fine. But I still think Emily has something to do with it.,2024-09-03 21:57:24
1379,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design without asking, Rachel?",2024-09-03 20:42:27
1380,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"I didn't take it, Tom. I just used it since you weren't around and we had a deadline.",2024-09-03 20:45:27
1381,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"That's not an excuse! This was my work, and you didn't even credit me.",2024-09-03 20:50:27
1382,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more available, I wouldn't have to make such decisions.",2024-09-03 20:55:27
1383,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,Don't turn this around on me. It's not my fault you can't plan properly.,2024-09-03 20:59:27
1384,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my planning that's the problem? That's rich coming from someone who misses half the meetings.",2024-09-03 21:03:27
1385,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"I miss meetings because I have actual work to do, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:09:27
1386,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,And I don't? You're unbelievable. You just sit there and complain without offering any solutions.,2024-09-03 21:18:27
1387,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,At least I don't steal other people's work to make myself look good.,2024-09-03 21:23:27
1388,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"I didn't steal it, I borrowed it for the good of the team!",2024-09-03 21:24:27
1389,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"If you can't see the difference, then I don't know what to tell you.",2024-09-03 21:25:27
1390,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"Maybe because there is no difference! We're supposed to be a team, but you're acting like a solo artist.",2024-09-03 21:28:27
1391,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"A team respects each other's contributions. Clearly, you don't understand that.",2024-09-03 21:35:27
1392,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"Oh, please. Your ""contributions"" have caused nothing but delays and problems.",2024-09-03 21:44:27
1393,escalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,I deliver results. If you can't,2024-09-03 21:51:27
1394,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,Why did you go ahead and submit the group project without discussing it with us first?,2024-09-03 20:44:29
1395,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,I thought it was finished! We were running out of time and no one else was making any changes.,2024-09-03 20:54:29
1396,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_3,But you didn't even ask us if we were okay with the final version. There were still things I wanted to add!,2024-09-03 20:55:29
1397,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,Exactly! We could have improved the conclusion at least. You should have waited.,2024-09-03 21:03:29
1398,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,"Look, I'm sorry, but someone had to take the lead. Would you have preferred we miss the deadline?",2024-09-03 21:10:29
1399,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_3,"It’s not about missing the deadline, it’s about respecting everyone’s input. You made a decision for the whole group.",2024-09-03 21:13:29
1400,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,This isn't the first time you've done something like this. It's like you don't trust us to make decisions.,2024-09-03 21:16:29
1401,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,"Trust? I trust you all to contribute, but when no one is acting, what choice do I have?",2024-09-03 21:25:29
1402,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_3,We were acting; we just needed a bit more time. You always rush through things without proper discussion.,2024-09-03 21:26:29
1403,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,This project could have been much better if we had all worked on it until the end. Now we're stuck with something incomplete because of you.,2024-09-03 21:34:29
1404,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,Stuck with something incomplete? Really? Aren't we a bit dramatic here? I did what I thought was best for the team.,2024-09-03 21:43:29
1405,escalatory_conversation_95,speaker_3,Maybe next time think about what's actually best,2024-09-03 21:53:29
1406,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't come to the group meeting yesterday.,2024-09-03 20:45:33
1407,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,Are you serious? I told you I had a family emergency!,2024-09-03 20:50:33
1408,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,You always have some excuse when it's your turn to contribute.,2024-09-03 20:58:33
1409,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,And you always think you're the only one doing any work. That's not fair at all!,2024-09-03 21:03:33
1410,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_3,Can we just focus on getting the project done? Accusations aren't helping.,2024-09-03 21:06:33
1411,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,"Sure, like you're one to talk. You haven't shown up to half the meetings either.",2024-09-03 21:09:33
1412,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_3,"My schedule is packed, but at least I update the shared documents. Unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:14:33
1413,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,"Oh, so now this is all my fault? At least I don't criticize others without looking at myself.",2024-09-03 21:18:33
1414,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,"You know what, maybe we should just split the work and stop pretending this is a group.",2024-09-03 21:27:33
1415,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_3,Fine by me. I've been carrying both of you anyway.,2024-09-03 21:33:33
1416,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,"Oh really? Let's see how well you do without our parts, genius.",2024-09-03 21:42:33
1417,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,You think your parts are so crucial? Let's test that theory.,2024-09-03 21:49:33
1418,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_3,Bring it on. I'll gladly prove I don't need either of you dragging me down.,2024-09-03 21:51:33
1419,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,I can't believe I ever thought we could work as a team.,2024-09-03 21:56:33
1420,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,Team? More like three people stuck in the same dysfunctional boat.,2024-09-03 22:02:33
1421,escalatory_conversation_96,speaker_3,Good luck sinking without a,2024-09-03 22:10:33
1422,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,Why did you take my design without asking?,2024-09-03 20:43:35
1423,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I didn't take anything!,2024-09-03 20:50:35
1424,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,I saw the presentation you gave to the client. That's my work!,2024-09-03 20:58:35
1425,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. I added my own touches. It's not like you own creativity.",2024-09-03 21:06:35
1426,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,You changed a couple of colors and now it’s yours? Give me a break.,2024-09-03 21:13:35
1427,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,Stop being so possessive. We’re supposed to be a team!,2024-09-03 21:14:35
1428,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,A team doesn't steal each other's ideas.,2024-09-03 21:16:35
1429,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,"Maybe if you shared your work earlier, this wouldn’t have happened.",2024-09-03 21:19:35
1430,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,I shouldn’t have to worry about you swiping my designs!,2024-09-03 21:27:35
1431,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,"You know what? Maybe you should worry, given how slow you are at getting things done.",2024-09-03 21:28:35
1432,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,You’ve got to be kidding me. I’m the one who always meets deadlines.,2024-09-03 21:35:35
1433,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,"Deadlines, sure. But the quality? Questionable.",2024-09-03 21:43:35

1435,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,Because someone had to salvage this project from your mediocrity!,2024-09-03 21:57:35
1436,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,You just can’t admit you needed my work to keep us afloat.,2024-09-03 21:58:35
1437,escalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,"Fine. You want credit? Take it, but don’t act like you’re the only one putting in effort here.",2024-09-03 22:08:35
1438,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,Did you seriously sabotage my project in the science fair?,2024-09-03 20:48:38
1439,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,I didn't sabotage anything. Your project was already flawed.,2024-09-03 20:50:38
1440,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,Flawed? I saw you tampering with my display when I wasn't looking!,2024-09-03 20:59:38
1441,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,"You know what? Maybe if you had put in more effort, you wouldn't have to blame others for your failures.",2024-09-03 21:05:38
1442,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,I put in plenty of effort! You’re just jealous because everyone liked my project more.,2024-09-03 21:07:38
1443,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,Jealous? Don’t make me laugh. My project was twice as complex and actually worked.,2024-09-03 21:16:38
1444,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,Complexity doesn’t mean it was better! Mine was practical and innovative.,2024-09-03 21:22:38
1445,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,"Innovatively boring. Just admit it, you couldn't handle the competition.",2024-09-03 21:29:38
1446,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,At least I didn't have to resort to sneaky tactics. You're just a sore loser.,2024-09-03 21:36:38
1447,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,"Or maybe you're just paranoid. Not everything that goes wrong is someone else's fault, you know.",2024-09-03 21:43:38
1448,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,Paranoid? How can I not be when you’re messing with my stuff?,2024-09-03 21:53:38
1449,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,"Prove it then! If you have evidence, why not show it instead of accusing me?",2024-09-03 21:55:38
1450,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,Fine! I'll talk to the judges and get to the bottom of this.,2024-09-03 22:00:38
1451,escalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,Go ahead. Let's see how far your baseless accusations get you.,2024-09-03 22:08:38
1452,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you pass me the ball, Jake? We had a clear shot at the goal!",2024-09-03 20:44:40
1453,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"Are you kidding me, Alex? Every time I pass you the ball, you fumble it!",2024-09-03 20:51:40
1454,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,That’s not true! You just don’t trust anyone but yourself on the field!,2024-09-03 20:52:40
1455,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus on the game here? This isn't helping.",2024-09-03 20:55:40
1456,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"Stay out of this, Mike. Alex needs to learn how to play as a team.",2024-09-03 21:02:40
1457,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"And you need to stop being such a control freak, Jake!",2024-09-03 21:11:40
1458,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_4,Coach is gonna bench both of you if you keep at it.,2024-09-03 21:13:40
1459,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"Maybe he should bench Alex, since he’s the one dragging us down!",2024-09-03 21:22:40
1460,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"Oh, like you’ve never made a mistake, Mr. Perfect!",2024-09-03 21:25:40
1461,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_3,"Seriously, we don’t have time for this. The other team is already ahead.",2024-09-03 21:34:40
1462,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"Fine, but don’t blame me when we lose because Alex can’t handle the pressure.",2024-09-03 21:37:40
1463,escalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,I’d rather lose than play with someone who thinks they’re better than everyone else!,2024-09-03 21:41:40
1464,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,Why did you use my presentation slides without asking?,2024-09-03 20:43:44
1465,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"I didn't think you'd mind. We’re on the same team, aren't we?",2024-09-03 20:47:44
1466,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,That's not the point! You should have asked me first.,2024-09-03 20:56:44
1467,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,Seriously? You didn't have anything special on there anyway.,2024-09-03 21:02:44
1468,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,"That's not for you to decide. They were my work, and you took the credit.",2024-09-03 21:07:44
1469,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"Credit? We're supposed to be working together, not keeping score.",2024-09-03 21:11:44
1470,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,It's not about keeping score; it's about respect. You completely disregarded my effort!,2024-09-03 21:19:44
1471,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. You're overreacting. It was just a few slides.",2024-09-03 21:29:44
1472,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,It’s more than just the slides. You keep doing this. It's like you don’t value what I bring.,2024-09-03 21:36:44
1473,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"OK, maybe if you contributed more consistently, this wouldn’t be an issue.",2024-09-03 21:39:44
1474,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,"Are you kidding me? I work just as hard as you, if not harder!",2024-09-03 21:42:44
1475,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"Yeah, right. You’re always taking shortcuts, and I have to pick up the slack.",2024-09-03 21:47:44
1476,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,That’s so unfair! When have I ever taken shortcuts?,2024-09-03 21:56:44
1477,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"Last week, with the budget report. I had to redo half of it because you missed important details.",2024-09-03 22:02:44
1478,escalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,I missed a couple of minor points. Big deal. It's not like you’re perfect either,2024-09-03 22:04:44
1479,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,I can't believe you just went ahead and made the decision without telling me.,2024-09-03 20:51:47
1480,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,"Someone had to make a call, and you weren't available.",2024-09-03 20:55:47
1481,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,That's not an excuse. We agreed to make all decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:03:47
1482,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,It was urgent. Waiting for you would've jeopardized everything.,2024-09-03 21:08:47
1483,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,Can we please just focus on fixing it instead of arguing?,2024-09-03 21:12:47
1484,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,That's easy for you to say. It's not your project on the line.,2024-09-03 21:15:47
1485,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,I'm tired of you acting like you're the only one who cares about this.,2024-09-03 21:19:47
1486,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,Acting like? I've been the one carrying most of the work!,2024-09-03 21:24:47
1487,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. What's done is done. Let's plan our next steps.",2024-09-03 21:27:47
1488,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,"Next steps? We wouldn't need ""next steps"" if someone had followed the plan.",2024-09-03 21:28:47
1489,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,"Every time something goes wrong, you start pointing fingers. It's exhausting.",2024-09-03 21:36:47
1490,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,"Seriously, we have a deadline. Is bickering more important than completing the project?",2024-09-03 21:46:47
1491,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,"Fine, but this isn't over. I'm not just going to forget about this.",2024-09-03 21:50:47
1492,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,"Sure, whatever. Just tell me what to do now, since your opinion is the only one that matters.",2024-09-03 21:52:47
1493,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,"Okay, enough. Let's divide the tasks and get moving. No more arguing.",2024-09-03 21:58:47
1494,escalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,"Whatever, let's just finish this mess.",2024-09-03 21:59:47
1495,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot to bring the presentation files, Alex.",2024-09-03 20:48:49
1496,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you had reminded me, I wouldn't have forgotten, Jenna!",2024-09-03 20:55:49
1497,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,"It's not my job to remind you about every single task. We have deadlines, you know.",2024-09-03 21:01:49
1498,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,Deadlines you keep pushing on us without even consulting the team. We're overloaded!,2024-09-03 21:05:49
1499,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,Can you both stop arguing? We're supposed to be a team. This is getting us nowhere.,2024-09-03 21:08:49
1500,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,Maybe we wouldn't be arguing if Alex could handle even the simplest tasks.,2024-09-03 21:17:49
1501,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,And maybe we'd get the files done if you stopped micromanaging everything.,2024-09-03 21:27:49
1502,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn't the time for a blame game. We need to focus on fixing this!",2024-09-03 21:35:49
1503,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,"Fine, but Alex needs to step up. I can't do everything myself.",2024-09-03 21:39:49
1504,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,"Oh, like you're the only one working here? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:43:49
1505,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,Enough! We're wasting precious time. Let's split the tasks and get it done.,2024-09-03 21:46:49
1506,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,Only if Alex promises not to drop the ball again.,2024-09-03 21:52:49
1507,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,And Jenna has to stop acting like a dictator.,2024-09-03 21:55:49
1508,escalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,"Agreed. Everyone just commit to your part, and let's make this work.",2024-09-03 22:03:49
1509,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball in the last quarter, Jill? We could have scored!",2024-09-03 20:49:52
1510,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Mike. You were totally out of position. I made the right call!",2024-09-03 20:51:52
1511,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,Out of position? I was wide open! You never trust anyone but yourself with the ball!,2024-09-03 20:58:52
1512,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously, this isn't helping. We need to focus on what went wrong overall, not just one play.",2024-09-03 21:02:52
1513,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,"Fine, but Mike needs to understand that teamwork isn't about one person getting all the glory.",2024-09-03 21:06:52
1514,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,Glory? This is about winning! You keep hogging the ball and we're all suffering for it!,2024-09-03 21:07:52
1515,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_4,Can we stop pointing fingers and actually plan our strategy for the next game?,2024-09-03 21:09:52
1516,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Tom. You're not the one being blamed for everything.",2024-09-03 21:15:52
1517,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,"Maybe if you passed more, we wouldn't have to blame you!",2024-09-03 21:21:52
1518,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_3,Enough! This constant bickering isn't fixing anything. Let's discuss the play and practice how to improve.,2024-09-03 21:26:52
1519,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_4,Jess is right. Arguing like this won't help us win. Let's go through what happened and fix our mistakes together.,2024-09-03 21:36:52
1520,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,"Fine. But next time, trust us and pass the ball.",2024-09-03 21:38:52
1521,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,And you need to be more aware of your position. We all need to play smarter.,2024-09-03 21:45:52
1522,escalatory_conversation_103,speaker_3,Agreed.,2024-09-03 21:51:52
1523,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot to submit the project, Sarah. We worked on it for weeks.",2024-09-03 20:45:55
1524,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"Me? You're the one who was supposed to finalize the report, Mark!",2024-09-03 20:55:55
1525,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"No, I was responsible for the data analysis. You said you'd handle the submission.",2024-09-03 21:05:55
1526,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"Well, you should've checked in with me. It's a group project.",2024-09-03 21:13:55
1527,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"Right, and as a group, we rely on each other to do our parts, which you didn't.",2024-09-03 21:23:55
1528,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"Oh, that's rich coming from the guy who disappeared for half the meetings.",2024-09-03 21:33:55
1529,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"I had other commitments, and I told you all about them in advance!",2024-09-03 21:36:55
1530,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"Commitments or not, you should've been more present. Everyone else managed their schedules.",2024-09-03 21:46:55
1531,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"That's easy for you to say. Unlike you, I have a job and other responsibilities!",2024-09-03 21:49:55
1532,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"Well, your ""other responsibilities"" have cost us our grade now.",2024-09-03 21:59:55
1533,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"This is unbelievable. Maybe if you weren't so clingy about the submission, you'd have done it on time.",2024-09-03 22:05:55
1534,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"Clingy? I was trying to keep us organized. Clearly, someone had to since you couldn't be bothered!",2024-09-03 22:15:55
1535,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,Organized? More like controlling. You didn't even trust us with simple tasks.,2024-09-03 22:17:55
1536,escalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,Trust? How can I trust someone who doesn't show up and then blames others for,2024-09-03 22:26:55
1537,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you took the last of the coffee without making more, Chris.",2024-09-03 20:45:58
1538,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"Oh come on, Jen. It's just coffee. I'll make some later.",2024-09-03 20:53:58
1539,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"It's not just about the coffee! It's about being considerate and responsible, especially in a shared space.",2024-09-03 20:56:58
1540,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,You always blow things out of proportion. It's not that big of a deal.,2024-09-03 21:04:58
1541,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"Maybe it's not a big deal to you, but it's one more thing that shows how inconsiderate you can be.",2024-09-03 21:09:58
1542,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,That’s rich coming from you. Need I remind you who’s always leaving dirty dishes in the sink?,2024-09-03 21:18:58
1543,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"At least I eventually clean them. This isn’t about the dishes, it’s about respect!",2024-09-03 21:28:58
1544,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,So now I don’t respect you just because I didn’t make more coffee? Give me a break.,2024-09-03 21:35:58
1545,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,That’s exactly the attitude I’m talking about. You just don’t care about anyone but yourself.,2024-09-03 21:42:58
1546,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"Like you’re some kind of saint? Please, Jen, everyone knows how self-centered you are.",2024-09-03 21:52:58
1547,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"If I’m so self-centered, why do I end up cleaning up after you all the time?",2024-09-03 21:55:58
1548,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"Oh here we go again, playing the martyr. Maybe it's because you’re obsessed with control.",2024-09-03 22:04:58
1549,escalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,I wouldn’t have to be if you weren’t so lazy and careless!,2024-09-03 22:05:58
1550,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted the report without consulting me!,2024-09-03 20:44:01
1551,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,"I didn't have a choice! The deadline was approaching, and you were nowhere to be found.",2024-09-03 20:52:01
1552,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"Nowhere to be found? I was in a meeting with the client, which, by the way, you skipped.",2024-09-03 21:00:01
1553,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,"I had more pressing matters to attend to. Besides, the client meetings are usually a waste of time.",2024-09-03 21:01:01
1554,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"Seriously? That ""waste of time"" could have answered half the questions you bungled in the report!",2024-09-03 21:06:01
1555,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault? How about the time you forgot to include the financial analysis?",2024-09-03 21:12:01
1556,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"That was an honest mistake, and I owned up to it. This is deliberate sabotage!",2024-09-03 21:20:01
1557,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,Sabotage? Give me a break. You just can't stand not being in control for once.,2024-09-03 21:25:01
1558,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,Control? I'm trying to ensure quality. Something you clearly don't care about.,2024-09-03 21:27:01
1559,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,Quality? What about the time you shipped an incomplete project just to meet a deadline?,2024-09-03 21:33:01
1560,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,That was under extreme pressure and we were all hands on deck. You're just making excuses.,2024-09-03 21:41:01
1561,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,Excuses? You're the one with all the justifications for your mistakes while I'm blamed for everything.,2024-09-03 21:44:01
1562,escalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"Maybe if you communicated instead of acting like a lone wolf, we wouldn't be in this",2024-09-03 21:54:01
1563,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,Why did you eat the last piece of cake without asking everyone first?,2024-09-03 20:47:05
1564,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal. It was in the fridge for two days, no one seemed to want it.",2024-09-03 20:57:05
1565,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,"That's not the point. We all share this apartment, and it's common courtesy to ask.",2024-09-03 21:04:05
1566,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_3,"Yeah, we've had this conversation so many times. Why is it so hard to understand basic respect?",2024-09-03 21:14:05
1567,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,Respect? Seriously? It was just a piece of cake. You all need to chill.,2024-09-03 21:21:05
1568,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,"No, it's about setting a precedent. If you keep doing this, what's next? Taking other people's food without permission?",2024-09-03 21:30:05
1569,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"Oh please, don't exaggerate. It's not like I'm stealing your groceries.",2024-09-03 21:38:05
1570,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_3,It's not an exaggeration. We need to trust each other. What if someone was saving that cake for a special reason?,2024-09-03 21:45:05
1571,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"Well, no one told me they were saving it. So how am I supposed to know?",2024-09-03 21:54:05
1572,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,That's why you ask! It's not that complicated.,2024-09-03 21:57:05
1573,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_3,And it's not just about the cake. This keeps happening with other things too. Like my shampoo last week.,2024-09-03 22:06:05
1574,escalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"I told you, I ran out and needed some. I was going to replace it.",2024-09-03 22:11:05

1577,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it’s my fault we’re losing? Maybe if you guys played better, it wouldn’t matter so much!",2024-09-03 20:52:07
1578,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_3,"Hold on, Tim. It sucks that we’re losing, but ditching practice isn’t helping anyone. We need you on the field.",2024-09-03 20:55:07
1579,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,Exactly. How can we trust you to lead us if you won’t even show up?,2024-09-03 21:04:07
1580,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,"You think I don’t WANT to be there? Maybe if Coach would stop giving me all the crap assignments, I’d have more motivation!",2024-09-03 21:08:07
1581,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_3,Crap assignments? Are you serious right now? Those drills are important for the whole team!,2024-09-03 21:11:07
1582,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,"And what are we supposed to think when our captain skips out because he’s upset about drills? It’s not professional, Tim!",2024-09-03 21:13:07
1583,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,"Professional? We’re not pros. We’re a college team! There’s more to life than this game, you know.",2024-09-03 21:20:07
1584,escalatory_conversation_108,speaker_3,"Sure, but we’ve all committed our time to this. If you don’t want to be there, at least tell us straight up.",2024-09-03 21:22:07

1589,escalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,That doesn't give you the right to just toss it out without asking me!,2024-09-03 20:56:10
1590,escalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you didn't leave your junk everywhere, I wouldn't have to make these decisions.",2024-09-03 20:59:10
1591,escalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,Junk? That painting took me weeks to finish!,2024-09-03 21:04:10
1592,escalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,"It didn't even look good anyway, Lucy. Why are you so worked up about it?",2024-09-03 21:05:10
1593,escalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,How can you be so insensitive? Just because it's not important to you doesn't mean it's worthless!,2024-09-03 21:07:10

1598,escalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,"I'm not trying to control anything, I'm just trying to keep the house in order.",2024-09-03 21:33:10
1599,escalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,By throwing away things that matter to me? Seems like you're doing a terrible job!,2024-09-03 21:41:10

1603,escalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,What are you talking about? We both worked on it.,2024-09-03 20:59:13
1604,escalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,"Yeah, but that specific part was mine! You didn't even mention my name.",2024-09-03 21:01:13
1605,escalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you want all the glory? We’re supposed to be a team, remember?",2024-09-03 21:03:13
1606,escalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,A team doesn't mean stepping all over each other to get ahead!,2024-09-03 21:13:13

1624,escalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,And now we might fail because of you!,2024-09-03 21:30:17

1633,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,Why did you take my notebook without asking?,2024-09-03 20:52:20
1634,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,"I needed it for the project, okay? What's the big deal?",2024-09-03 20:58:20
1635,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,The big deal is you never ask for my things! You always just take them!,2024-09-03 21:05:20
1636,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,"Well, maybe I wouldn't have to if you were more organized. Your stuff was just lying there!",2024-09-03 21:12:20

1640,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,Respect? You want respect? Try giving some first! You've been ignoring my texts for days!,2024-09-03 21:31:20
1641,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,Because I'm busy! Just because you have nothing better to do doesn't mean I can drop everything!,2024-09-03 21:38:20

1644,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,It feels like it because I'm doing everything! What about your part of the work?,2024-09-03 21:59:20
1645,escalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,My part? I can't even start on it because you hoard all the materials!,2024-09-03 22:07:20

1651,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. This isn't helping us get any closer to finishing the report.,2024-09-03 21:02:23
1652,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,"Calm down? The deadline is today, Laura! How can I calm down?",2024-09-03 21:08:23
1653,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,"Right, Laura, maybe if Don wasn't so focused on blaming me, we'd get something productive done.",2024-09-03 21:13:23
1654,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_3,Insulting each other isn't going to get the report finished. We need to focus.,2024-09-03 21:23:23

1656,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,"Yeah, I'm all ears. Spill it.",2024-09-03 21:41:23
1657,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_3,We can each take a section and finish it together. It'll go faster if we collaborate.,2024-09-03 21:51:23
1658,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,"I still think Stephanie should own up to her part, though. We’re so far behind because of her.",2024-09-03 21:57:23
1659,escalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,"Great, more finger-pointing. How mature, Don.",2024-09-03 21:59:23

1672,escalatory_conversation_114,speaker_2,Seriously? Are we really going to fight over a piece of paper?,2024-09-03 21:20:26

1674,escalatory_conversation_114,speaker_2,Maybe your hard work isn't as important as you think.,2024-09-03 21:31:26
1675,escalatory_conversation_114,speaker_1,How dare you! You wouldn’t have a project without my design.,2024-09-03 21:33:26
1676,escalatory_conversation_114,speaker_2,Don’t think so highly of yourself. I managed just fine.,2024-09-03 21:38:26

1685,escalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,"Look, I was specific! You just don't listen when people talk to you!",2024-09-03 21:22:29
1686,escalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,And you never stop to think that maybe your instructions are impossible to follow!,2024-09-03 21:27:29
1687,escalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,You're always making excuses for everything. Just admit you messed up!,2024-09-03 21:28:29
1688,escalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,I'm not making excuses. I'm pointing out that you need to communicate better!,2024-09-03 21:34:29
1689,escalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,I communicate just fine. You just need to try a little harder to understand!,2024-09-03 21:40:29
1690,escalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. You're just deflecting blame because you can't accept any responsibility.",2024-09-03 21:47:29

1695,escalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you submitted the report without consulting me?,2024-09-03 20:45:32
1696,escalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,"Because every time I try to involve you, you either change everything or ignore my input completely!",2024-09-03 20:49:32

1699,escalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,Maybe because your ideas aren't practical half the time!,2024-09-03 21:08:32
1700,escalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're saying I'm incompetent? That's rich coming from someone who micromanages everything.",2024-09-03 21:16:32

1707,escalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,Unbelievable. So now it's all my fault?,2024-09-03 22:05:32
1708,escalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,"Pretty much, yes. You need to start respecting other people's contributions.",2024-09-03 22:09:32

1713,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,"I had plans that were already made. Besides, we practice too much anyway.",2024-09-03 20:47:35
1714,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,Too much? We barely have enough practice for our gig next week!,2024-09-03 20:55:35
1715,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so obsessed with perfection, we could have a life outside of this band.",2024-09-03 20:56:35
1716,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,Obsessed? Wanting us to actually sound good isn't being obsessed.,2024-09-03 21:03:35
1717,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,Sound good? You're acting like we're auditioning for a record label. We're just playing at a local bar!,2024-09-03 21:13:35
1718,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,"Every gig matters if we ever want to get noticed. But clearly, you just don't care.",2024-09-03 21:18:35
1719,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,Don't care? I've been at every rehearsal but one! You're overreacting.,2024-09-03 21:21:35
1720,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,It's not overreacting when you're jeopardizing everything we've worked for.,2024-09-03 21:24:35
1721,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,Jeopardizing? One missed rehearsal is not going to ruin our band.,2024-09-03 21:27:35
1722,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,"It's an attitude problem, not just one missed rehearsal. You always have something else that's more important.",2024-09-03 21:36:35
1723,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,I have a life! I can't drop everything for the band every single time.,2024-09-03 21:41:35
1724,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,Maybe you should reconsider being in this band if you can't commit.,2024-09-03 21:49:35
1725,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,Maybe I will! But then good luck finding someone else to play bass.,2024-09-03 21:57:35
1726,escalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,Don't think we can't replace you. You're not that irreplaceable.,2024-09-03 22:01:35
1727,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,"You know, I'm getting really tired of you slacking off in our group project.",2024-09-03 20:52:39
1728,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,Slacking off? Are you serious? I've done just as much as you have.,2024-09-03 20:54:39
1729,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,"That's a joke! You haven't even touched the research part, which was your main responsibility.",2024-09-03 20:57:39
1730,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,Maybe because I've been busy correcting your sloppy data entry!,2024-09-03 20:59:39
1731,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus on finishing this instead of blaming each other?",2024-09-03 21:05:39
1732,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you haven't been pulling your weight either.",2024-09-03 21:08:39
1733,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_3,That's not fair. I've been trying to mediate between you two and keeping us on track.,2024-09-03 21:16:39
1734,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,"Yeah, great job with that. We're so ""on track"" right now.",2024-09-03 21:18:39
1735,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_4,"Honestly, if you both keep at each other's throats, this whole project is doomed.",2024-09-03 21:19:39
1736,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's all on us? What about your part, huh? The analysis is full of errors.",2024-09-03 21:26:39
1737,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_4,Errors? Because I had to rush it since NONE of you provided your sections on time!,2024-09-03 21:36:39
1738,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_3,This isn't helping. We need to split the remaining tasks and get this done before the deadline.,2024-09-03 21:46:39
1739,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,How about you actually contribute for once instead of playing peacekeeper?,2024-09-03 21:55:39
1740,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,And you could stop acting like a dictator. We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 22:03:39
1741,escalatory_conversation_118,speaker_4,I'm with speaker_2 on this,2024-09-03 22:11:39
1742,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up at the studio yesterday? We needed to finalize the album mix.,2024-09-03 20:43:42
1743,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,I told you I had other plans. You can't expect me to drop everything last minute.,2024-09-03 20:50:42
1744,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,"Other plans? This is our band, our future. What could be more important than that?",2024-09-03 21:00:42
1745,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_3,"Guys, we really need to focus on what's best for the group, not personal schedules.",2024-09-03 21:02:42
1746,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,Easy for you to say. You're not the one sacrificing all your free time for this.,2024-09-03 21:08:42
1747,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,Sacrificing? We all are! You're not special just because you have things going on.,2024-09-03 21:10:42
1748,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_3,Can we come up with a compromise? Maybe set a fixed schedule everyone agrees on.,2024-09-03 21:18:42
1749,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,We already had a schedule! You're the one who keeps ignoring it.,2024-09-03 21:23:42
1750,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,"Because it doesn't work for me! I have a life outside this band, you know.",2024-09-03 21:27:42
1751,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,"And we don't? If this isn't a priority for you, maybe you shouldn't be in the band.",2024-09-03 21:32:42
1752,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe I'm tired of your controlling attitude.,2024-09-03 21:35:42
1753,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_3,"Seriously, can we all just calm down for a second? We have a great opportunity here.",2024-09-03 21:39:42
1754,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,Calm down? It's hard to stay calm when someone isn't committed.,2024-09-03 21:47:42
1755,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,"Oh, I'm committed, just not to being treated like a doormat.",2024-09-03 21:55:42
1756,escalatory_conversation_119,speaker_3,This,2024-09-03 21:59:42
1757,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,I can't believe you messed up the presentation slides again.,2024-09-03 20:47:45
1758,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you had given me clear instructions, it wouldn't have happened!",2024-09-03 20:55:45
1759,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,Clear instructions? I literally sent you an entire email detailing everything!,2024-09-03 20:56:45
1760,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"That email was confusing, and you know it!",2024-09-03 20:59:45
1761,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. We need to fix the slides, not argue about whose fault it is.",2024-09-03 21:00:45
1762,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,I'm just frustrated because this always happens when you handle the slides.,2024-09-03 21:10:45
1763,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's always my fault? What about the last presentation when you forgot the handouts?",2024-09-03 21:11:45
1764,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,That was a one-time thing! You’ve messed up the slides three times now!,2024-09-03 21:15:45
1765,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn’t micromanage everything, I could actually do a good job!",2024-09-03 21:18:45
1766,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,Micromanage? I’m just trying to make sure we don’t look incompetent!,2024-09-03 21:26:45
1767,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_3,"Seriously, this arguing is pointless. How do we fix the slides?",2024-09-03 21:33:45
1768,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"Fine, I’ll fix them again. But this time, can you make sure your instructions are actually clear?",2024-09-03 21:42:45
1769,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,And can you try not to mess it up this time?,2024-09-03 21:46:45
1770,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_3,"Alright, we’ve established the problem. Let’s focus on the solution now.",2024-09-03 21:47:45
1771,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"Ok, I’ll review the slides one more time. Happy?",2024-09-03 21:51:45
1772,escalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,I'll,2024-09-03 22:00:45
1773,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"You always leave the team hanging, Clara. We have deadlines and you just ignore them!",2024-09-03 20:46:48
1774,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"That's unfair, Mike! I have other responsibilities too. Why should I be the only one blamed?",2024-09-03 20:47:48
1775,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"Everyone here has responsibilities, but they manage to complete their tasks on time. So what's your excuse?",2024-09-03 20:50:48
1776,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't dump all the difficult parts on me, I'd manage better. Ever thought of that?",2024-09-03 20:54:48
1777,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. Let's focus on finding a solution.",2024-09-03 21:00:48
1778,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Sarah. You're not the one constantly picking up Clara's slack!",2024-09-03 21:06:48
1779,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"And you're not the one constantly being overloaded, Mike! That's the real issue here.",2024-09-03 21:14:48
1780,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_3,"We're a team. We have to work together, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:17:48
1781,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"Well, tell that to Clara, who seems to think she's above the rest of us.",2024-09-03 21:26:48
1782,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"You know that's not true! I just need some understanding and support, maybe a little redistribution of tasks.",2024-09-03 21:29:48
1783,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_4,"If we're reassessing workloads, then everyone needs to agree on what’s fair. We can't keep pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 21:39:48
1784,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"Fine, Mike. What do you suggest then? You have all the answers, right?",2024-09-03 21:40:48
1785,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,How about we each lay out our responsibilities and figure out a fair way to redistribute the tasks?,2024-09-03 21:42:48
1786,escalatory_conversation_121,speaker_3,That sounds,2024-09-03 21:46:48
1787,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,Why didn't you wash the dishes like I asked you to?,2024-09-03 20:44:51
1788,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,Because I was busy doing my homework. You always think your chores are more important than my school work.,2024-09-03 20:52:51
1789,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,That's not true! You had plenty of time to get them done. You just chose to ignore it.,2024-09-03 20:59:51
1790,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,"No, I didn't ignore it! You always pile up responsibilities on me like I don't have my own stuff to handle.",2024-09-03 21:06:51
1791,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,"If you managed your time better, this wouldn't even be an issue. Maybe if you weren't always on your phone, things would get done.",2024-09-03 21:09:51
1792,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my phone's fault? Maybe if you helped out every once in a while instead of just criticizing, things would be easier for both of us.",2024-09-03 21:19:51
1793,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,Help? I do more than my fair share around here. You're just too lazy to pitch in.,2024-09-03 21:27:51
1794,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,Lazy? That's rich coming from you. It's not like you're the perfect model of efficiency either.,2024-09-03 21:29:51
1795,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,"You know what? Forget it. From now on, I'll just do everything myself since you can't be relied on.",2024-09-03 21:35:51
1796,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,Fine with me! Maybe then you'll finally see how unrealistic your expectations are.,2024-09-03 21:39:51
1797,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,"Unrealistic? They're basic responsibilities. If you can't handle them, maybe you need to grow up.",2024-09-03 21:48:51
1798,escalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,And maybe you need to stop acting like a dictator. Not everything revolves around,2024-09-03 21:55:51
1799,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,I can't believe you broke your promise and didn't show up to my art exhibit.,2024-09-03 20:50:55
1800,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, like your little show is the most important thing in the world.",2024-09-03 20:52:55
1801,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,It was important to me! You promised you'd be there for support.,2024-09-03 20:57:55
1802,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,Support? You mean like how you supported me by missing my big presentation last week?,2024-09-03 21:04:55
1803,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,That was different! I had a work emergency.,2024-09-03 21:08:55
1804,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,And now you're making excuses. Typical.,2024-09-03 21:14:55
1805,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,At least I had a valid reason. You just blew me off for a party!,2024-09-03 21:23:55
1806,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,You're overreacting. It's not the end of the world.,2024-09-03 21:26:55
1807,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,It's called being reliable and keeping your word. Ever heard of it?,2024-09-03 21:29:55
1808,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,Reliable? This coming from the person who couldn't even remember my birthday last month.,2024-09-03 21:31:55
1809,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,One mistake and you throw it back in my face? Mature.,2024-09-03 21:32:55
1810,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,"If you didn't make so many mistakes, maybe I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 21:38:55
1811,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,"Maybe if you cared about anything other than yourself, we wouldn't be having this argument.",2024-09-03 21:44:55
1812,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,"Oh, now I'm selfish? Great, add that to the list of things I'm terrible at.",2024-09-03 21:51:55
1813,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,Can you for once acknowledge that you messed up?,2024-09-03 22:00:55
1814,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,"Why should I, when you never do?",2024-09-03 22:04:55
1815,escalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,This isn't about me right now,2024-09-03 22:07:55
1816,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,Why did you take my favorite book without asking?,2024-09-03 20:45:01
1817,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,I needed it for my report! What's the big deal?,2024-09-03 20:47:01
1818,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,The big deal is that you didn’t even bother to let me know. Now I can't find it!,2024-09-03 20:51:01
1819,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if your stuff wasn’t always scattered everywhere, it wouldn’t be so hard to find!",2024-09-03 20:58:01
1820,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,Don’t you dare blame this on me! You should respect my things.,2024-09-03 21:05:01
1821,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,Respect? You don’t even respect my deadlines! I needed that book.,2024-09-03 21:06:01
1822,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,That doesn’t give you the right to just grab things whenever you want!,2024-09-03 21:10:01
1823,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,"Fine! Next time, I’ll just fail my class because you can’t share.",2024-09-03 21:14:01
1824,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it’s my fault you procrastinated? Typical!",2024-09-03 21:15:01
1825,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,At least I’m not a control freak who can’t handle a little inconvenience.,2024-09-03 21:25:01
1826,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,"If by control freak you mean someone who likes their things in order, then yes!",2024-09-03 21:27:01
1827,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,Maybe you should focus less on order and more on actually helping others!,2024-09-03 21:29:01
1828,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,"How can I help when you never ask? It's just demand, demand, demand!",2024-09-03 21:32:01
1829,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,Because asking nicely doesn’t work with you! You always say no!,2024-09-03 21:42:01
1830,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,Maybe because I know you'll just mess everything up and not even apologize!,2024-09-03 21:51:01
1831,escalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,Mess everything up?,2024-09-03 21:58:01
1832,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and made that decision without consulting any of us!,2024-09-03 20:47:04
1833,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,Are you serious? I had to make a quick call. You weren't around!,2024-09-03 20:55:04
1834,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,"That's no excuse! We all agreed on teamwork, and you just threw that out the window!",2024-09-03 21:01:04
1835,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_3,"Yeah, we're supposed to be a unit. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:11:04
1836,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! You guys never appreciate the tough choices I have to make.",2024-09-03 21:21:04
1837,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,Tough choices? You just want to control everything!,2024-09-03 21:29:04
1838,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_3,You always act like you're the only one who knows what's best!,2024-09-03 21:30:04
1839,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,That's because I'm the only one actually doing anything productive around here!,2024-09-03 21:31:04
1840,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,"Productive? You mean, undermining our efforts and making unilateral decisions?",2024-09-03 21:36:04
1841,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_3,Exactly! We have a process for a reason. Why do you think your way is always the right way?,2024-09-03 21:44:04
1842,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,"If we followed your processes, we'd be stuck in meetings all day and never get anything done!",2024-09-03 21:46:04
1843,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,"At least with meetings, we'd make decisions as a team! You're just steamrolling us!",2024-09-03 21:54:04
1844,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_3,And this isn't the first time. You keep pulling this kind of stunt.,2024-09-03 22:00:04
1845,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you two stepped up more, I wouldn’t have to!",2024-09-03 22:10:04
1846,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,Stepped up? We've been carrying our weight and then some!,2024-09-03 22:17:04
1847,escalatory_conversation_125,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:25:04
1848,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot to pick up the supplies again, Rachel.",2024-09-03 20:47:08
1849,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,"Seriously, Tim? You're the one who was supposed to remind me!",2024-09-03 20:57:08
1850,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,I shouldn't have to remind you every single time. We talked about this!,2024-09-03 20:58:08
1851,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 20:59:08
1852,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"Oh great, now it's my fault? You're unbelievable.",2024-09-03 21:00:08
1853,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,At least I don't just sit around complaining. Do you ever think about actually contributing?,2024-09-03 21:04:08
1854,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,Contributing? I do all the planning while you just show up when it's convenient for you!,2024-09-03 21:09:08
1855,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,That's rich coming from someone who spent the whole meeting last week texting!,2024-09-03 21:16:08
1856,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,Maybe I was texting because I was tired of your useless chatter!,2024-09-03 21:20:08
1857,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,"Useless chatter? Maybe if you listened, you'd actually learn something useful.",2024-09-03 21:25:08
1858,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"Learn something from you? Please, your ideas are always half-baked.",2024-09-03 21:27:08
1859,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,Half-baked? Better than no ideas at all. When was the last time you had a good one?,2024-09-03 21:35:08
1860,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"You know what? If you think you're so great, why don't you lead this project alone?",2024-09-03 21:37:08
1861,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,"Fine! Maybe I will, and it will be ten times better without your negativity dragging us down!",2024-09-03 21:41:08
1862,escalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,Good luck with that. You'll see how hard it is without someone to clean up,2024-09-03 21:46:08
1863,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,Why did you change the project deadline without discussing it with the team?,2024-09-03 20:53:11
1864,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,Because no one was making any progress! Someone had to take charge.,2024-09-03 20:55:11
1865,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_3,"That's not fair, we all have a lot of work and other responsibilities.",2024-09-03 20:58:11
1866,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,Exactly! You can't just make decisions for everyone.,2024-09-03 21:07:11
1867,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"Well, someone has to do something or else we'll never finish.",2024-09-03 21:17:11
1868,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_3,But it’s not your place to decide that for the rest of us.,2024-09-03 21:27:11
1869,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"Fine, then what’s your great idea to get things moving?",2024-09-03 21:30:11
1870,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,We could have discussed different strategies together instead of you unilaterally changing the deadline.,2024-09-03 21:40:11
1871,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"Discussions take time, which we don’t have!",2024-09-03 21:47:11
1872,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_3,Rushing things won't help either. Quality will suffer.,2024-09-03 21:50:11
1873,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"Quality? No one's even working on the project, so what quality are you talking about?",2024-09-03 21:54:11
1874,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,"We're all working hard, but we also need to balance other responsibilities.",2024-09-03 22:04:11
1875,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,Maybe you should prioritize better then.,2024-09-03 22:13:11
1876,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_3,"Oh, so now it's our fault?",2024-09-03 22:23:11
1877,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,You’re being unreasonable. This isn't how a team functions.,2024-09-03 22:26:11
1878,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"Maybe if the team actually functioned, I wouldn't have to make these decisions!",2024-09-03 22:27:11
1879,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_3,You’re making it worse by not communicating. We need to collaborate.,2024-09-03 22:35:11
1880,escalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,Collaboration is pointless if no one,2024-09-03 22:44:11
1881,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Jake? We had a clear shot!",2024-09-03 20:48:14
1882,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"Seriously, Michelle? You were completely out of position!",2024-09-03 20:57:14
1883,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,"Out of position? I was right by the goal, you just didn't even look!",2024-09-03 21:02:14
1884,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"Look, Michelle, you're always blaming me when you mess up. Maybe you need to work on your positioning!",2024-09-03 21:09:14
1885,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_3,"Can both of you just focus? We're a team, not a bunch of solo players!",2024-09-03 21:16:14
1886,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,"Stay out of it, Mark. This isn't about you.",2024-09-03 21:24:14
1887,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"Actually, Mark's right. You're always trying to play hero, Michelle.",2024-09-03 21:32:14
1888,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_3,"Guys, we're losing because we're not working together.",2024-09-03 21:35:14
1889,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,"Oh, now you're going to lecture me too, Mark? You should be telling Jake to do his job!",2024-09-03 21:41:14
1890,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't hog the ball so much, Michelle, we'd have more chances!",2024-09-03 21:51:14
1891,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,Hog the ball? Are you serious? You're the one who never passes unless you feel like it!,2024-09-03 21:59:14
1892,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_3,Enough! This isn't helping us win. We need to figure out how to communicate better on the field.,2024-09-03 22:07:14
1893,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,"Fine. But Jake, you better start paying attention to where your teammates are.",2024-09-03 22:17:14
1894,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"And you, Michelle, need to stop acting like you're the only one who can score.",2024-09-03 22:27:14
1895,escalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,Whatever. Let's just win,2024-09-03 22:30:14
1896,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"You know, it's really frustrating how you always hog the spotlight during our band practice.",2024-09-03 20:50:17
1897,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! I'm just trying to make sure we sound good. Someone has to step up.",2024-09-03 20:53:17
1898,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,Step up? More like show off. You don't even let anyone else suggest changes to the songs.,2024-09-03 20:57:17
1899,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_3,"Yeah, I have to agree. We barely get a chance to contribute. It doesn't feel like a team effort.",2024-09-03 21:04:17
1900,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"That's because your suggestions are always so off-base. I have a vision for this band, and it's working!",2024-09-03 21:13:17
1901,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_4,Working? We've been playing the same three songs for months. We're not growing because you won't listen.,2024-09-03 21:17:17
1902,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,Maybe we're not growing because some of you don't practice enough! You want to talk about commitment?,2024-09-03 21:27:17
1903,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"Don't twist this around! We all practice, we're just tired of being sidelined by your ego.",2024-09-03 21:28:17
1904,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_3,"Exactly. We started this band as friends, but now it feels like you're trying to be the solo act.",2024-09-03 21:36:17
1905,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"If you guys think you can do better, maybe I should just leave the band.",2024-09-03 21:44:17
1906,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_4,"This isn't about kicking anyone out, it's about working together and actually being a band.",2024-09-03 21:49:17
1907,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"Yeah, if you can't compromise, then what's the point? We're in this together, or not at all.",2024-09-03 21:55:17
1908,escalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"Fine, you want me to listen?",2024-09-03 22:04:17
1909,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design and present it as your own in the team meeting, Sarah?",2024-09-03 20:51:22
1910,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,"Your design? We worked on that together, Jason. I made significant contributions too.",2024-09-03 20:56:22
1911,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,"Significant contributions? You just tweaked a few things. The core concept was mine, and you know it!",2024-09-03 21:06:22
1912,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,"Oh please, tweaking a few things? I practically rebuilt your whole concept. You were stuck, and I got it moving again.",2024-09-03 21:07:22
1913,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,"Stuck? Are you serious? I was refining the details, not stuck.",2024-09-03 21:13:22
1914,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,Details? You were tinkering like you always do and getting nowhere! I took action.,2024-09-03 21:18:22
1915,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,"Tinkering? That's called being thorough, Sarah. You bypassed the whole creative process and just rushed it.",2024-09-03 21:23:22
1916,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,"Rushed it? I streamlined it. If it weren't for me, we would still be going over endless revisions!",2024-09-03 21:30:22
1917,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,And now you're taking all the credit for something we were supposed to share equally!,2024-09-03 21:36:22
1918,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,Share equally? You’ve been monopolizing the spotlight since day one of this project!,2024-09-03 21:44:22
1919,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,Me? Monopolizing? I've always acknowledged your contributions!,2024-09-03 21:48:22
1920,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,"Acknowledged? Like a footnote at best. Meanwhile, you take the center stage every time.",2024-09-03 21:58:22
1921,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,That's because I've put in the most effort!,2024-09-03 22:06:22
1922,escalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,"That's your perception, Jason",2024-09-03 22:13:22
1923,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,Why did you switch off my alarm this morning?,2024-09-03 20:46:25
1924,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,Because you kept snoozing it and it was annoying!,2024-09-03 20:47:25
1925,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,You know I needed to wake up early for my job interview!,2024-09-03 20:55:25
1926,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,"Well, it's not my fault you can't wake up on your own.",2024-09-03 21:03:25
1927,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,You could've just let it be. Now I missed my interview!,2024-09-03 21:10:25
1928,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,Maybe you should take responsibility for your own wake-up time.,2024-09-03 21:16:25
1929,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,You're so inconsiderate! I was relying on that alarm.,2024-09-03 21:23:25
1930,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,"Oh, I'm inconsiderate? At least I don't need someone else to wake me up.",2024-09-03 21:27:25
1931,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,This was a big opportunity for me. Do you even care?,2024-09-03 21:29:25
1932,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,"Honestly, if you let an alarm ruin your chances, maybe you didn't deserve the job.",2024-09-03 21:32:25
1933,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,That's really harsh and uncalled for. You had no right to decide that for me.,2024-09-03 21:41:25
1934,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,I'm just tired of you always depending on me for everything!,2024-09-03 21:45:25
1935,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,Depending on you? It's just an alarm. You're making it into a bigger issue.,2024-09-03 21:54:25
1936,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,"It's always something with you. Today an alarm, tomorrow something else.",2024-09-03 21:56:25
1937,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,I can't believe you're being this selfish. How would you feel if the roles were reversed?,2024-09-03 21:57:25
1938,escalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,"If the roles were reversed, I would've figured something out instead of blaming you.",2024-09-03 21:59:25
1939,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball when I was open? We lost because of that!,2024-09-03 20:50:28
1940,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,Seriously? You missed all your shots in practice! I didn't trust you'd make it.,2024-09-03 20:51:28
1941,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,"Practice isn't the game! I was feeling it today, and you still ignored me!",2024-09-03 20:53:28
1942,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_3,"Guys, we need to chill. Blaming each other won't help us improve.",2024-09-03 20:59:28
1943,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one who gets blamed for every loss!",2024-09-03 21:05:28
1944,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,Because you're always hogging the ball! You need to trust your teammates!,2024-09-03 21:10:28
1945,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_3,"We're supposed to be a team, not a bunch of individuals looking to be heroes.",2024-09-03 21:12:28
1946,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,"Exactly, but someone thinks they're the only one who can score.",2024-09-03 21:16:28
1947,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,Maybe because I have the most points this season. What does that tell you?,2024-09-03 21:20:28
1948,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_3,It tells me that we're focusing too much on individual stats instead of playing as a team.,2024-09-03 21:24:28
1949,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,And focusing on stats is what cost us the game today. We need to play smarter.,2024-09-03 21:27:28
1950,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all on me? What about all those missed rebounds? Huh?",2024-09-03 21:31:28
1951,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,Maybe we'd get more rebounds if we actually worked together and communicated better.,2024-09-03 21:35:28
1952,escalatory_conversation_132,speaker_3,"We need to figure this out, or every game will end like this. Team meetings, more passes, better communication—something.",2024-09-03 21:36:28
1953,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for rehearsal again, Alex. What is your problem?",2024-09-03 20:49:31
1954,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,"My problem? My problem is that this band is a joke, Sara. I have better things to do.",2024-09-03 20:58:31
1955,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_3,"Seriously, Alex? How can you say that? We've been in this band together for years!",2024-09-03 21:01:31
1956,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,"Exactly, Jason. And we all make sacrifices. You're the only one treating this like a hobby.",2024-09-03 21:08:31
1957,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,"Oh, so because I don't bow down to your obsessive schedule, I'm the problem? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:12:31
1958,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_4,"Can we calm down for a second? We're supposed to work together, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:20:31
1959,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,"No, Ethan, we can't just ""calm down."" Alex has been slacking off for weeks.",2024-09-03 21:26:31
1960,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,"Maybe because I'm tired of being bossed around by you, Sara. You're not the band leader.",2024-09-03 21:33:31
1961,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_3,"Alex, you knew what you were signing up for. We all agreed to practice three times a week.",2024-09-03 21:35:31
1962,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,"Yeah, well I changed my mind. Deal with it.",2024-09-03 21:44:31
1963,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_4,"Think about the gigs we have lined up. If we don't practice, we'll be embarrassing ourselves on stage.",2024-09-03 21:54:31
1964,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,"Do you even care about the band anymore, Alex? Because if not, maybe you should just leave.",2024-09-03 22:01:31
1965,escalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,Maybe I will. Maybe I won’t. Why should,2024-09-03 22:10:31
1966,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,I don't believe you actually finished the group project last night.,2024-09-03 20:53:35
1967,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I told you I did my part.,2024-09-03 21:01:35
1968,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,Then why is there nothing in the shared folder?,2024-09-03 21:11:35
1969,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_3,"Seriously, we all agreed to upload our sections by yesterday!",2024-09-03 21:15:35
1970,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"I did it, okay? Maybe there's a problem with the internet or something.",2024-09-03 21:17:35
1971,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,Convenient excuse. You always have some sort of technical issue.,2024-09-03 21:22:35
1972,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the unreliable one?",2024-09-03 21:29:35
1973,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_3,We can't keep dealing with this every time we have a project. Do you even care about getting a good grade?,2024-09-03 21:31:35
1974,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"Of course, I care! I just don't see why I'm always the one to blame.",2024-09-03 21:33:35
1975,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,Because it's always your part that's missing or late. Are you even taking this seriously?,2024-09-03 21:38:35
1976,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"I'm trying my best, unlike some people who barely contribute and just point fingers.",2024-09-03 21:40:35
1977,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_3,"That's not fair. We all contribute, but trust is a two-way street.",2024-09-03 21:49:35
1978,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,"Exactly. We need to trust that you're doing your part, and right now it doesn't feel like that.",2024-09-03 21:58:35
1979,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,How can I show you I did it if the stupid folder didn't save my work?,2024-09-03 22:03:35
1980,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,"Maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 22:09:35
1981,escalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"And maybe if you trusted me a little, we",2024-09-03 22:15:35
1982,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,Why didn't you clean the kitchen when it was your turn?,2024-09-03 20:44:39
1983,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,I told you I had to work late! I couldn't get to it.,2024-09-03 20:45:39
1984,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,That's not an excuse; we all have responsibilities here.,2024-09-03 20:54:39
1985,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"Oh, please. Last week, you skipped out on cleaning because you had ""plans.""",2024-09-03 21:01:39
1986,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,That was different! It was a one-time thing. You do this all the time.,2024-09-03 21:06:39
1987,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,Are you kidding me? I'm the one who usually ends up doing everyone's dishes!,2024-09-03 21:13:39
1988,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,"No, you don't. You just think you do because you only remember when it inconveniences you.",2024-09-03 21:16:39
1989,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"Yeah, right. You always point fingers but never actually help out.",2024-09-03 21:24:39
1990,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,Maybe because I don't want to touch the gross mess you leave everywhere!,2024-09-03 21:33:39
1991,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"If you think I'm so messy, why don't you just move out?",2024-09-03 21:43:39
1992,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,Maybe I will! This isn't worth the stress.,2024-09-03 21:53:39
1993,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"Good, because I'm tired of always being blamed for everything.",2024-09-03 21:55:39
1994,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,Then maybe you should actually start doing your fair share!,2024-09-03 21:59:39
1995,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,Then maybe you should stop acting like you're better than everyone else!,2024-09-03 22:03:39
1996,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,Fine. I guess we'll see how much gets done when I'm gone.,2024-09-03 22:04:39
1997,escalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,Fine by me. It's not like you were contributing much anyway.,2024-09-03 22:09:39
1998,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,Why did you use the company credit card without asking?,2024-09-03 20:53:42
1999,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,I needed to buy some supplies for the project. What’s the big deal?,2024-09-03 20:55:42
2000,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,The big deal is that you should have cleared it with me first! We have a budget to stick to.,2024-09-03 21:03:42
2001,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_3,"Yeah, now we’ve exceeded our monthly budget. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:09:42
2002,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,I was thinking of getting things done! You two are always bogged down in red tape.,2024-09-03 21:11:42
2003,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,"That ""red tape"" is called financial responsibility!",2024-09-03 21:16:42
2004,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_3,Exactly! You can’t just go off and make purchases without consulting us.,2024-09-03 21:19:42
2005,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,"If I wait for your approval, the project will never move forward. We’re always behind because of these delays.",2024-09-03 21:29:42
2006,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,"Delays happen because we’re trying to manage our resources properly, not because we’re careless!",2024-09-03 21:31:42
2007,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_3,And now we have to explain to upper management why the budget is overrun. This is going to affect all of us.,2024-09-03 21:34:42
2008,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,Well maybe upper management should know how inefficiently we’re operating. Maybe they’ll do something about it.,2024-09-03 21:42:42
2009,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,That is not your call to make! You’re jeopardizing the entire team's reputation.,2024-09-03 21:50:42
2010,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_3,"Seriously, you can’t just go rogue whenever you feel like it.",2024-09-03 21:53:42
2011,escalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,I’m tired of everything being a committee decision. Sometimes action needs to be taken.,2024-09-03 22:02:42
2012,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 20:51:46
2013,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,Because I wanted it. What's the big deal?,2024-09-03 21:01:46
2014,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,The big deal is that you always do this. It's incredibly selfish.,2024-09-03 21:11:46
2015,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,"Oh, please. Like you don’t do selfish things too.",2024-09-03 21:14:46
2016,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,Name one time I've done something like this!,2024-09-03 21:15:46
2017,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,Remember last week when you borrowed my headphones and never returned them?,2024-09-03 21:25:46
2018,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,That was an accident. I would have given them back if you had just asked.,2024-09-03 21:33:46
2019,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,"Just like if you had asked, I might have saved you a piece of cake.",2024-09-03 21:39:46
2020,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,You can't compare the two. A piece of cake is nothing like a pair of headphones.,2024-09-03 21:43:46
2021,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,"Right, because it’s always worse when someone does something against you, isn’t it?",2024-09-03 21:44:46
2022,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,You don't get it. It's about consideration. You never consider other people.,2024-09-03 21:54:46
2023,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,"Oh, and you're the saint who always thinks about everyone else? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:57:46
2024,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,"See, now you're just deflecting. This is exactly what you do in every argument.",2024-09-03 22:02:46
2025,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,Maybe I deflect because you're always attacking me over the smallest things.,2024-09-03 22:06:46
2026,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,They wouldn’t be small things if you showed a little more respect or responsibility.,2024-09-03 22:11:46
2027,escalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,And maybe I would be more responsible if you didn’t always,2024-09-03 22:13:46
2028,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,"You still haven't finished your part of the group project, and it's due tomorrow!",2024-09-03 20:45:48
2029,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,"I've been swamped with work, okay? Why didn't you remind me earlier?",2024-09-03 20:50:48
2030,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,I didn't think I needed to babysit you. You're supposed to be responsible!,2024-09-03 20:59:48
2031,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break! You've been slacking off just as much as I have.",2024-09-03 21:09:48
2032,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_3,Can both of you stop fighting? We need to figure out how to get this done.,2024-09-03 21:12:48
2033,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you've only had the easy parts to handle.",2024-09-03 21:20:48
2034,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_3,"My parts are important too, you know. Let's not downplay each other's work.",2024-09-03 21:24:48
2035,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,Whatever. We're wasting more time arguing than actually working.,2024-09-03 21:30:48
2036,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,"Fine, but you're staying up all night to finish your part. No excuses.",2024-09-03 21:31:48
2037,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,"Like I have a choice now, do I? Thanks for making this a nightmare.",2024-09-03 21:41:48
2038,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,"Maybe next time, don't wait until the last minute!",2024-09-03 21:48:48
2039,escalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,"And maybe next time, communicate better!",2024-09-03 21:58:48
2040,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"Hey, did you take my tools from the garage again?",2024-09-03 20:44:51
2041,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"Well, yeah. I needed them for a project.",2024-09-03 20:53:51
2042,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,I told you to ask me first. Now they're scattered everywhere!,2024-09-03 21:03:51
2043,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"Relax, I'll put them back later.",2024-09-03 21:06:51
2044,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,That's not the point! I couldn't find anything when I needed it!,2024-09-03 21:14:51
2045,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,You're overreacting. It's just tools.,2024-09-03 21:23:51
2046,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"It's not ""just tools"" to me! I organized them for a reason.",2024-09-03 21:31:51
2047,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"Honestly, you're being so uptight about this.",2024-09-03 21:38:51
2048,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,And you're being so irresponsible!,2024-09-03 21:47:51
2049,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,Irresponsible? I'm just borrowing them!,2024-09-03 21:48:51
2050,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"Without permission, as always. That’s disrespectful.",2024-09-03 21:55:51
2051,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"Oh, like you never grab my stuff without asking.",2024-09-03 21:58:51
2052,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,When? Name one time!,2024-09-03 22:00:51
2053,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,What about my bike last weekend?,2024-09-03 22:04:51
2054,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"I fixed it for you! You're welcome, by the way!",2024-09-03 22:06:51
2055,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,I didn't ask you to! You just assume things!,2024-09-03 22:13:51
2056,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,This is ridiculous. Learn some respect for other people's property.,2024-09-03 22:16:51
2057,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,Maybe you should stop treating me like a child.,2024-09-03 22:25:51
2058,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,Maybe act like an adult first!,2024-09-03 22:31:51
2059,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,Maybe I would if you weren't so controlling!,2024-09-03 22:41:51
2060,escalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"I'm not controlling, I'm organized. There's a difference.",2024-09-03 22:51:51
2061,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up to the meeting today?,2024-09-03 20:49:54
2062,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,I didn't know there was a meeting scheduled.,2024-09-03 20:51:54
2063,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,I sent out a reminder email yesterday! How could you not know?,2024-09-03 20:58:54
2064,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,I never got any reminder email. Maybe you sent it to the wrong address.,2024-09-03 21:00:54
2065,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"No, I double-checked. It was sent to the whole team. You're the only one who didn't show up.",2024-09-03 21:08:54
2066,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you communicated better, I would have known. This isn't entirely on me.",2024-09-03 21:11:54
2067,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,This isn't about my communication skills. It's about your lack of attention to detail.,2024-09-03 21:14:54
2068,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the one with the problem? Maybe you're just looking for someone to blame because the project is falling apart.",2024-09-03 21:21:54
2069,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"The project would be fine if everyone did their part, including you.",2024-09-03 21:31:54
2070,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,Don't act like you're perfect. You've missed deadlines too.,2024-09-03 21:41:54
2071,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,At least I take responsibility for my mistakes. You've been slacking for weeks.,2024-09-03 21:47:54
2072,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,"And you've been micromanaging everything, making it impossible to get anything done.",2024-09-03 21:51:54
2073,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"Micromanaging? If I didn't, nothing would get done around here.",2024-09-03 21:53:54
2074,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,"Maybe if you trusted us more, we could actually be productive.",2024-09-03 22:02:54
2075,escalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"Trust has to be earned, and right now, you're not doing a good job of that.",2024-09-03 22:07:54
2076,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,"I can't believe you, Emily. You promised to submit the group project on time!",2024-09-03 20:50:58
2077,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"I did, Jack! But the server was down when I tried to upload it! What do you want me to do about that?",2024-09-03 20:59:58
2078,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,That's just an excuse! You should have started earlier if you knew the server might be an issue!,2024-09-03 21:00:58
2079,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because you did so much for this project, Jack. You hardly showed up for our meetings!",2024-09-03 21:07:58
2080,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. This isn't helping!,2024-09-03 21:13:58
2081,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"This affects all of us, Sarah! We could fail because of Jack's lack of commitment and the server issues!",2024-09-03 21:16:58
2082,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,"Don't turn this around on me, Emily! Maybe if you'd communicated better, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:18:58
2083,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_3,Enough! Blaming each other won't fix anything. How do we make this right with the professor?,2024-09-03 21:26:58
2084,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,It's too late! We missed the deadline because of this incompetence!,2024-09-03 21:35:58
2085,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"Incompetence? At least I tried to fix things, Jack. You just sat back and did nothing!",2024-09-03 21:40:58
2086,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_3,"We need a solution, not more fighting. Emily, did you email the professor explaining the server issue?",2024-09-03 21:45:58
2087,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"No, I haven't. I was too busy trying to upload the file repeatedly!",2024-09-03 21:48:58
2088,escalatory_conversation_141,speaker_3,Then do it now. The least we can do is,2024-09-03 21:50:58
2089,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,"Why did you drop the ball again during the game, Sam? We’ve been practicing for weeks!",2024-09-03 20:46:01
2090,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Alex! It was a tough pass. Not everything is my fault!",2024-09-03 20:47:01
2091,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,A tough pass? It was right in your hands! You always have an excuse.,2024-09-03 20:51:01
2092,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,"And you always think you're perfect, don't you? Maybe if you passed better, I’d catch it!",2024-09-03 20:59:01
2093,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_3,Can we all calm down? Pointing fingers isn't going to help us win.,2024-09-03 21:03:01
2094,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, Jordan! We need to address the problem. Sam is clearly not focused.",2024-09-03 21:04:01
2095,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,That's rich coming from someone who missed an easy goal last game. How about you focus on your own mistakes?,2024-09-03 21:10:01
2096,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously. We need to fix this as a team or we'll keep losing. Arguing will only make things worse.",2024-09-03 21:18:01
2097,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,"Fine. But Sam needs to step it up, or we'll never make it to the finals.",2024-09-03 21:28:01
2098,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,"Oh, like you're some kind of superhero who never makes mistakes. Give me a break!",2024-09-03 21:31:01
2099,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,At least I own up to my mistakes. You just keep blaming everyone else!,2024-09-03 21:32:01
2100,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_3,This is pointless. We need to figure out what’s going wrong and fix it together.,2024-09-03 21:37:01
2101,escalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,How about we start with Sam admitting he needs to improve?,2024-09-03 21:39:01

2113,escalatory_conversation_143,speaker_1,That's not the point! You didn't contribute as much and then you have the nerve to steal my answers.,2024-09-03 21:20:06
2114,escalatory_conversation_143,speaker_3,We need to talk to the professor and sort this out.,2024-09-03 21:29:06

2121,escalatory_conversation_144,speaker_3,Can we just focus on fixing it instead of blaming each other?,2024-09-03 21:15:09

2136,escalatory_conversation_145,speaker_1,That's not true! I checked the guidelines multiple times.,2024-09-03 21:08:12

2148,escalatory_conversation_145,speaker_3,Enough! We're going in circles. This isn't,2024-09-03 22:14:12
2149,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,Why is my project missing from the presentation folder?,2024-09-03 20:45:16
2150,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,Maybe because it wasn’t good enough to be there.,2024-09-03 20:51:16
2151,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,That's not for you to decide! I put in hours of work on that project.,2024-09-03 20:56:16
2152,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. We can figure this out.",2024-09-03 21:01:16
2153,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,"No, they need to hear this. Their project was sloppy and would have brought the team down.",2024-09-03 21:03:16

2155,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_4,Can we please not turn this into a personal attack?,2024-09-03 21:17:16
2156,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,Personal attack? They’re the one complaining about their precious project.,2024-09-03 21:24:16
2157,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,I have every right to complain when something I've worked hard on is dismissed without explanation.,2024-09-03 21:28:16
2158,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_3,Maybe we can discuss what criteria were used to select the projects?,2024-09-03 21:32:16

2160,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,Are you kidding me? I had data too. Did you even read my report?,2024-09-03 21:47:16
2161,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_4,The main issue here is communication. We should have talked about these criteria beforehand.,2024-09-03 21:55:16
2162,escalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,"And what’s your role in this, exactly? You’re always on the fence, never making real decisions.",2024-09-03 22:03:16

2167,escalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,That's not the point! You should have asked me first. It's my work.,2024-09-03 20:55:19
2168,escalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,"Well, if we'd waited for you, we'd never have made any progress.",2024-09-03 20:58:19
2169,escalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,That's incredibly unfair. I've been working tirelessly on this project.,2024-09-03 21:02:19

2176,escalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,And I feel like you're more concerned about credit than the project’s success.,2024-09-03 21:39:19
2177,escalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,"That's not true! I want the project to succeed, but not at the cost of fairness.",2024-09-03 21:44:19

2184,escalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,I sent you the sketches weeks ago. Why didn't you say anything then?,2024-09-03 21:00:23
2185,escalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,Because you made it obvious you were going to do whatever you wanted regardless of what I said.,2024-09-03 21:06:23
2186,escalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,That's not fair. We needed to be coordinated. The director is furious!,2024-09-03 21:16:23
2187,escalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,Maybe the director should appreciate a little individuality instead of forcing everyone into a box.,2024-09-03 21:24:23
2188,escalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,It's not about individuality; it's about team cohesion. You’ve messed up the entire visual theme!,2024-09-03 21:29:23

2191,escalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,Disrespectful? The disrespect started when you sidelined everyone else's ideas and pushed yours.,2024-09-03 21:43:23
2192,escalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,"That's not true! I tried to include everyone's thoughts, but we needed to make a decision.",2024-09-03 21:50:23

2210,escalatory_conversation_149,speaker_3,Enough! We can’t work like this. Can we just divvy up the remaining tasks and get it,2024-09-03 22:08:26
2211,escalatory_conversation_150,speaker_1,I can't believe you ditched us during the group project meeting.,2024-09-03 20:46:32

2277,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_3,"Enough with the excuses, everyone else was there and we covered for you—again.",2024-09-03 21:25:44
2278,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,You act like I wanted this to happen. It's not my fault things went sideways!,2024-09-03 21:26:44
2279,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_3,"Maybe if you actually took responsibility for once, we'd be in a better position.",2024-09-03 21:36:44
2280,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,Responsibility? I do more work than both of you combined when I'm here!,2024-09-03 21:40:44
2281,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who missed the most crucial part of the project.,2024-09-03 21:47:44
2282,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe you guys just can't handle pressure without blaming someone else.,2024-09-03 21:51:44
2283,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_3,"Oh, we can handle pressure. We're just tired of your unpredictability sinking our efforts.",2024-09-03 21:54:44
2284,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,It's easy to blame me when you're scared of facing your own inadequacies.,2024-09-03 21:56:44
2285,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,Inadequacies? Did you even read the notes we sent last night?,2024-09-03 21:57:44
2286,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,"Notes? I never got them, probably because no one bothered to include me in the loop.",2024-09-03 21:59:44
2287,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_3,You know that's not true. Stop deflecting and own up to your mistakes.,2024-09-03 22:00:44
2288,escalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I did miss them",2024-09-03 22:03:44
2289,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,Did you seriously eat the last slice of pizza without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 20:45:48
2290,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,"I did, and why does it matter? You never asked me when you took stuff before.",2024-09-03 20:55:48
2291,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,That's different! I didn't take the last slice. It's about being considerate.,2024-09-03 21:05:48
2292,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,Considerate? Like the time you didn't clean up the mess in the kitchen after your friends came over?,2024-09-03 21:15:48
2293,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,"Oh, so we're going to bring that up now? At least my friends don't make a mess every single time.",2024-09-03 21:21:48
2294,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually helped out more, there wouldn't be such a mess to begin with!",2024-09-03 21:25:48
2295,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,I help out plenty! You just never notice because you're so busy complaining.,2024-09-03 21:28:48
2296,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,Complaining? I'm the only one keeping things in order here!,2024-09-03 21:32:48
2297,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,That's such a joke. What about last weekend when you left everything for me to clean up?,2024-09-03 21:42:48
2298,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,"I had plans, and you knew that! I can't always cater to your schedule.",2024-09-03 21:43:48
2299,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't be having this argument.",2024-09-03 21:52:48
2300,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,Communication? You mean like how you never tell me when you're having people over?,2024-09-03 21:58:48
2301,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,"Because you always find something to nag about, no matter what.",2024-09-03 22:01:48
2302,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't nag if you weren't so selfish and actually thought about other people.,2024-09-03 22:08:48
2303,escalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,Selfish? You're the one who,2024-09-03 22:13:48
2304,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without asking us first!,2024-09-03 20:51:51
2305,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,"Someone had to do it! We've been dragging our feet for weeks, and nothing was getting done.",2024-09-03 20:57:51
2306,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_3,But we had a plan! We were supposed to review everything together today!,2024-09-03 21:07:51
2307,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,Exactly! Now we didn't get a chance to go over our parts or make any final changes.,2024-09-03 21:15:51
2308,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,It would have never gotten finished if I waited for both of you to stop arguing over every little detail.,2024-09-03 21:18:51
2309,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_3,That's not fair. We were trying to ensure the project was perfect and thorough.,2024-09-03 21:25:51
2310,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,And now it might not even be accurate because we didn't get to fact-check it.,2024-09-03 21:32:51
2311,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. I double-checked everything. You two are just mad that you weren't in control for once.",2024-09-03 21:39:51
2312,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_3,It's not about control; it's about teamwork and making sure everyone agrees.,2024-09-03 21:47:51
2313,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,Exactly. We are a team. You can’t just make decisions on your own.,2024-09-03 21:48:51
2314,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if this team actually functioned properly, I wouldn't have had to make the decision alone.",2024-09-03 21:51:51
2315,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_3,Functioned properly? You mean us discussing and planning is dysfunctional?,2024-09-03 21:56:51
2316,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,"We might take our time, but it's because we care about quality and collaboration.",2024-09-03 21:59:51
2317,escalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,Collaboration that goes nowhere! We've spent more time debating than actually working!,2024-09-03 22:06:51
2318,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,"Why didn't you finish your part of the project, Emma? We had a deadline!",2024-09-03 20:52:54
2319,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,"Don't blame this entirely on me, Steve. You didn't even show up for the group meetings.",2024-09-03 20:56:54
2320,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,Are you kidding? I missed one meeting because I was sick. What's your excuse for doing nothing?,2024-09-03 20:59:54
2321,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,"Maybe if you had actually communicated instead of disappearing, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:03:54
2322,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_3,"Guys, we're not going to solve anything by yelling.",2024-09-03 21:05:54
2323,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,"Stay out of it, Max. You didn't even double-check Emma's work like you said you would.",2024-09-03 21:13:54
2324,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,"And Max didn't even contribute any new ideas. He just went along with whatever you said, Steve.",2024-09-03 21:21:54
2325,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_3,"I'm sorry, but I didn't want to complicate things more than they already were.",2024-09-03 21:30:54
2326,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,"Great, so now you're admitting you didn't really help us at all?",2024-09-03 21:32:54
2327,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,No wonder this project turned out so poorly. We're all pointing fingers instead of taking responsibility.,2024-09-03 21:36:54
2328,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,"Responsibility? How about trying to submit something on time for once, Emma?",2024-09-03 21:39:54
2329,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,"And how about actually working as a team instead of trying to control everything, Steve?",2024-09-03 21:45:54
2330,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_3,Can we just focus on fixing this instead of arguing? We still have a chance to improve it before the final submission.,2024-09-03 21:47:54
2331,escalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,Why should I listen to either of you? It's clear you don't care,2024-09-03 21:55:54
2332,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without consulting the rest of us.,2024-09-03 20:49:57
2333,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to do it. You guys were dragging your feet.",2024-09-03 20:58:57
2334,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_3,"That's not fair, speaker_2. We had a meeting scheduled for today to finalize everything.",2024-09-03 21:00:57
2335,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_4,Exactly! You undermined our process and just took over.,2024-09-03 21:05:57
2336,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. Don't act like you were going to contribute anything last-minute anyway.",2024-09-03 21:11:57
2337,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_1,"That's not true. We all had assigned parts, and we were going to merge them today.",2024-09-03 21:13:57
2338,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"Look, if waiting meant risking a lower grade, I had to act.",2024-09-03 21:21:57
2339,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_3,Acting without permission isn't acceptable. We all deserve a say in our grade.,2024-09-03 21:22:57
2340,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_4,"You sabotaged the team spirit, speaker_2. How can we trust you now?",2024-09-03 21:23:57
2341,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"So, it's my fault we finished on time? Get real!",2024-09-03 21:25:57
2342,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_1,Finishing on time isn't the issue. Communication is. You monopolized the decision-making.,2024-09-03 21:34:57
2343,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"Maybe if you all communicated better, I wouldn't have had to make a judgment call.",2024-09-03 21:39:57
2344,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_3,"This is not fair. Everyone's input matters, not just yours.",2024-09-03 21:43:57
2345,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_4,We're supposed to be a team. You made us look like we're splintered and uncoordinated.,2024-09-03 21:47:57
2346,escalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"Fine, next time I'll let you",2024-09-03 21:55:57
2347,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 20:49:00
2348,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,I had other things to do. Can't always be available for every single meeting.,2024-09-03 20:58:00
2349,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,Other things? This project is due in two days! What could be more important?,2024-09-03 20:59:00
2350,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"I had to help my sister with her school work. Family comes first, in case you forgot.",2024-09-03 21:02:00
2351,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,"That's fine, but you could have at least sent a text. We waited for an hour.",2024-09-03 21:05:00
2352,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"Well, maybe you could have used that hour to actually get some work done instead of waiting around.",2024-09-03 21:14:00
2353,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,Excuse me? We've been doing all the work while you bail out every other meeting.,2024-09-03 21:18:00
2354,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,That's not true! I've done my part. You just want to control everything.,2024-09-03 21:22:00
2355,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,Control everything? I'm just trying to make sure we don't fail this project because you can't manage your time.,2024-09-03 21:32:00
2356,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't such a control freak, people would actually want to work with you.",2024-09-03 21:38:00
2357,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,"Maybe if you weren't so unreliable, we wouldn't have this problem!",2024-09-03 21:48:00
2358,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_3,Can you both stop it? This isn't helping us finish the project!,2024-09-03 21:58:00
2359,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,Stay out of it! This is between us.,2024-09-03 22:03:00
2360,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"You know what? I'm done. If you want it done your way, do it yourself.",2024-09-03 22:11:00
2361,escalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,"Fine, we will!",2024-09-03 22:13:00
2362,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,"Julia, we need to talk about the group project.",2024-09-03 20:48:04
2363,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,"What now, Mark? I turned in my part, didn’t I?",2024-09-03 20:49:04
2364,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,"Yeah, but it’s full of errors. We can’t submit it like that.",2024-09-03 20:56:04
2365,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,I did what I could. I didn’t have time to proofread.,2024-09-03 21:04:04
2366,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_3,"Guys, can we please just calm down? We’re all stressed.",2024-09-03 21:08:04
2367,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,"Calm down? Really, Alex? Julia didn’t even bother checking her work!",2024-09-03 21:15:04
2368,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,"Oh sure, everything’s my fault, right? It’s not like you’ve done anything special.",2024-09-03 21:18:04
2369,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,"At least my part didn’t need correcting. We’re supposed to be a team, not babysitters.",2024-09-03 21:24:04
2370,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,You think you’re so perfect. Why didn’t you offer to help if you noticed it was so bad?,2024-09-03 21:29:04
2371,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_3,Both of you need to stop. This isn’t helping.,2024-09-03 21:31:04
2372,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,Julia’s attitude isn’t helping either. We’re going to fail at this rate.,2024-09-03 21:36:04
2373,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,"Right, because it’s easier to blame me than to actually solve the problem.",2024-09-03 21:42:04
2374,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_3,"For the last time, screaming at each other isn’t solving anything. Can we focus on fixing the errors?",2024-09-03 21:46:04
2375,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,"Fine, but Julia needs to actually try this time.",2024-09-03 21:53:04
2376,escalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,"I’m done trying, Mark. Do it yourself",2024-09-03 22:03:04
2377,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pick up the supplies for the science fair project, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:46:07
2378,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"Are you seriously blaming me for this, Jamie? I told you I had practice!",2024-09-03 20:49:07
2379,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,Practice? That was just an excuse to get out of doing any real work!,2024-09-03 20:51:07
2380,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because you know my life better than I do. You're always acting like a control freak!",2024-09-03 20:52:07
2381,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,I'm a control freak because I actually care about getting things done on time!,2024-09-03 20:58:07
2382,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"Maybe if you stopped bossing me around, I'd be more willing to help!",2024-09-03 21:06:07
2383,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,"If you did your part without being told, I wouldn't need to boss you around!",2024-09-03 21:15:07
2384,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"Funny, coming from someone who always wants to take the credit for everything!",2024-09-03 21:24:07
2385,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,"That's because I'm the one who actually puts in the effort, unlike you!",2024-09-03 21:33:07
2386,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,Effort? All you do is complain and criticize. That's not teamwork!,2024-09-03 21:34:07
2387,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,Teamwork? I wouldn't need to critique if you'd just step up for once!,2024-09-03 21:35:07
2388,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"Whatever, Jamie. Maybe we should just work separately since you think so little of me.",2024-09-03 21:45:07
2389,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,Fine by me. At least this way I won't have to deal with your laziness.,2024-09-03 21:53:07
2390,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,And I won't have to deal with your overbearing attitude. Good luck doing it all on your own!,2024-09-03 21:54:07
2391,escalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,I don't need luck,2024-09-03 21:57:07
2392,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,I can't believe you let our group project fall apart like this.,2024-09-03 20:46:10
2393,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's entirely my fault?",2024-09-03 20:55:10
2394,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,Who was supposed to handle the presentation slides? You!,2024-09-03 21:03:10
2395,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,And who was supposed to do the research part but didn't? You!,2024-09-03 21:10:10
2396,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,Can we please try to figure out a solution instead of blaming each other?,2024-09-03 21:19:10
2397,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you didn't contribute anything significant either.",2024-09-03 21:25:10
2398,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,"I proofread everyone's work, that's significant!",2024-09-03 21:30:10
2399,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,Proofreading is nothing compared to creating an entire presentation!,2024-09-03 21:33:10
2400,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"Well, guess what, both of you failed. Now our grade is at risk.",2024-09-03 21:42:10
2401,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,"Maybe if we communicated better, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:49:10
2402,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"Oh, I communicated just fine. It's you two who didn't follow through.",2024-09-03 21:52:10
2403,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,How about we all admit we dropped the ball and find a way to fix this?,2024-09-03 22:01:10
2404,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"It's a bit late for peacekeeping, don't you think?",2024-09-03 22:10:10
2405,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,"This isn't helping. We need to divide remaining tasks now and work, or we're all screwed.",2024-09-03 22:17:10
2406,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,"Fine, I'll redo the slides, but I need accurate research info from you both.",2024-09-03 22:25:10
2407,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"I'll redo my research part, but no more screw-ups from either of you.",2024-09-03 22:30:10
2408,escalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,And I'll help compile everything again. Let's just get this,2024-09-03 22:36:10
2409,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,"Why do you always leave the lab in such a mess, Alex? It's really frustrating!",2024-09-03 20:46:13
2410,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again, Chris. I'm not the only one using the lab, you know.",2024-09-03 20:52:13
2411,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,But you're the only one who never cleans up! Everyone else manages to keep their space tidy.,2024-09-03 20:54:13
2412,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so obsessed with everything being perfect, we wouldn't have this problem.",2024-09-03 20:55:13
2413,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,"It's not about perfection, it's about respect for shared space. You should know that by now.",2024-09-03 21:01:13
2414,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"Respect works both ways, Chris. You could at least talk to me politely instead of always accusing.",2024-09-03 21:03:13
2415,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,How can I be polite when you ignore every single request to clean up?,2024-09-03 21:12:13
2416,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually communicated instead of nagging, I'd consider it.",2024-09-03 21:14:13
2417,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,I've communicated plenty! You just don't listen.,2024-09-03 21:19:13
2418,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,And maybe you should get off your high horse and stop acting like you're the boss of this lab.,2024-09-03 21:21:13
2419,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,"It's not about being the boss, it's about maintaining a functional workspace for everyone.",2024-09-03 21:23:13
2420,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"Funny, because it feels like it's about you trying to control everyone.",2024-09-03 21:27:13
2421,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,"Well, if controlling means ensuring the lab isn't a disaster area, then fine, call me controlling.",2024-09-03 21:36:13
2422,escalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"You know what, fine! I'll clean up, but don't expect me to care about it like you do.",2024-09-03 21:45:13
2423,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,Why did you lie to the entire team about finishing the project?,2024-09-03 20:52:17
2424,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,"I didn't lie, I just needed more time and thought I could handle it myself.",2024-09-03 20:56:17
2425,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,Needed more time? You've had two weeks! You didn't even ask for help.,2024-09-03 21:04:17
2426,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. Let's just figure out how to fix it.",2024-09-03 21:09:17
2427,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,"Oh, now you're the peacemaker? You've been slacking off this entire project.",2024-09-03 21:17:17
2428,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_4,Really? Blaming others now? It's your fault we're behind.,2024-09-03 21:24:17
2429,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,"Exactly! If you had just communicated, we could've pitched in and avoided this mess.",2024-09-03 21:29:17
2430,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,How about looking at yourselves? You're all so quick to point fingers but none of you are perfect.,2024-09-03 21:36:17
2431,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_3,"Alright, we all could've done better, but attacking each other isn't going to solve anything.",2024-09-03 21:37:17
2432,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_4,"Maybe if someone admitted they messed up, we could move forward.",2024-09-03 21:47:17
2433,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,"Admit it, speaker_2! You messed up and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:55:17
2434,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,"Fine, I messed up. But where were you when I was drowning in work?",2024-09-03 21:58:17
2435,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,Waiting for you to actually admit you needed help!,2024-09-03 22:05:17
2436,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_3,This isn't getting us anywhere. We need to focus on the deadline.,2024-09-03 22:08:17
2437,escalatory_conversation_164,speaker_4,"Yeah, speaker_2, what progress do you have? Let's see if we can salvage this.",2024-09-03 22:13:17
2438,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,Why haven't you finished your part of the group project yet?,2024-09-03 20:51:21
2439,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,I've been busy with other classes; it's not like you're the only one with a tight schedule.,2024-09-03 20:57:21
2440,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,"Busy? We've all got things to do, but that doesn't mean we can just ignore our responsibilities.",2024-09-03 21:02:21
2441,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if someone else pulled their weight, I wouldn't have to do everything last minute!",2024-09-03 21:06:21
2442,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you need to chill. Arguing isn't getting us anywhere.",2024-09-03 21:10:21
2443,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,"I'm sorry, but it's frustrating when deadlines get ignored. This project affects all our grades.",2024-09-03 21:20:21
2444,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,You act like I'm the only one slacking off. What about speaker_3? They haven't exactly been contributing either!,2024-09-03 21:21:21
2445,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_3,Seriously? I've been handling all the research while you two were bickering!,2024-09-03 21:25:21
2446,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,"Fine, maybe we've all been a bit negligent. But we need to figure out a solution, not just point fingers.",2024-09-03 21:27:21
2447,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,You're right. Maybe we should set up a schedule for what's left to do and stick to it.,2024-09-03 21:30:21
2448,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_3,Good idea. Let's split up the remaining tasks and double-check our work tomorrow.,2024-09-03 21:36:21
2449,escalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,"Agreed. We need to get this done before it's too late. Starting now, let's focus only on what needs to be done.",2024-09-03 21:42:21
2450,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,"Why did you change the design without telling me, Steve?",2024-09-03 20:50:26
2451,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"Because your design wasn’t working, Laura! We needed something that actually attracts clients.",2024-09-03 20:57:26
2452,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,When did you become the expert in what works? You didn't even bother to discuss it with the rest of the team.,2024-09-03 21:00:26
2453,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"Oh, so suddenly collaboration is important to you? Where was that attitude when you ignored my suggestions last week?",2024-09-03 21:10:26
2454,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,Your suggestions last week were completely off-base. I'm the project lead for a reason.,2024-09-03 21:15:26
2455,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"Project lead or control freak? There's a difference, and you’re really crossing the line.",2024-09-03 21:25:26
2456,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,At least I know what I’m doing. You’re just throwing random ideas out there and hoping they stick.,2024-09-03 21:34:26
2457,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,Random ideas? I’ve been in this industry as long as you have! Maybe longer.,2024-09-03 21:44:26
2458,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,Length of time doesn’t equal competency. You might want to remember that.,2024-09-03 21:53:26
2459,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"Oh, what? Now you’re questioning my skills altogether?",2024-09-03 21:57:26
2460,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,"If you keep undermining the project, yes, I am!",2024-09-03 22:04:26
2461,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"This isn't just your project, Laura. This is a team effort, and your dictator-style leadership isn't helping anyone.",2024-09-03 22:08:26
2462,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,Dictator-style? That’s rich coming from someone who thinks they can just override decisions without a word.,2024-09-03 22:15:26
2463,escalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"Maybe if you listened for once, there",2024-09-03 22:24:26
2464,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,We need to talk about the project presentation. Your slides are full of errors!,2024-09-03 20:47:29
2465,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,What do you mean? I spent hours on those slides. Maybe you're just not looking at them properly.,2024-09-03 20:52:29
2466,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,Not looking at them properly? The numbers in your graphs don't even add up!,2024-09-03 20:57:29
2467,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,"Oh, as if your part is so perfect! Did you even check your spelling? There are typos everywhere.",2024-09-03 20:59:29
2468,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. We have to present tomorrow. Can we just focus on fixing the slides?",2024-09-03 21:05:29
2469,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,"Maybe if someone had done their job properly the first time, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:09:29
2470,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,Seriously? You're the one who insisted on that complicated data analysis. No one understood what you were talking about.,2024-09-03 21:10:29
2471,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_3,Enough! Blaming each other won't get us anywhere. Let's split the work and fix what needs to be fixed.,2024-09-03 21:18:29
2472,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,"Fine, I'll correct the data, but this time actually review it before sending it over.",2024-09-03 21:24:29
2473,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,"And I'll go through the text again, since apparently I can't trust you to spell-check either.",2024-09-03 21:32:29
2474,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_3,"Good, finally some agreement. Now let's just get it done so we can at least try to look like a team tomorrow.",2024-09-03 21:34:29
2475,escalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,Then let's stop wasting time arguing and get to work.,2024-09-03 21:41:29
2476,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,"Why can't you ever be on time, Mark? We always end up starting late because of you.",2024-09-03 20:50:33
2477,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,"Oh, come on Karen! Last time, it was Sarah who was late, not me. Can't you just let it go for once?",2024-09-03 20:52:33
2478,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,"This isn't about just once. It's a pattern with you, Mark. This project's deadline is in two days, and you're always holding us back.",2024-09-03 20:59:33
2479,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_3,"Really, Mark? We've been counting on you to step up. What's your excuse this time?",2024-09-03 21:01:33
2480,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,You guys act like I'm the only one messing up. I did my part of the report. Sarah hasn't even finished hers yet!,2024-09-03 21:02:33
2481,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_4,"Don't drag me into this, Mark. I had an emergency last night. And I already informed Karen about it.",2024-09-03 21:11:33
2482,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,"Yes, Sarah informed me and she's working on it. Mark, you're just deflecting again.",2024-09-03 21:13:33
2483,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,Deflecting? How am I supposed to know about everyone's emergencies? I'm not a mind reader.,2024-09-03 21:20:33
2484,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,We're asking for basic communication and responsibility. Is that so hard for you to understand?,2024-09-03 21:27:33
2485,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_3,"Exactly. We need everyone to pull their weight, especially now. It's like you don't even care about this project.",2024-09-03 21:29:33
2486,escalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,"That's not true, and you know it. You're all just ganging up on me. Maybe if you all communicated better, we wouldn't have these issues.",2024-09-03 21:38:33
2487,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,"Why did you take my project and turn it in as yours, Josh?",2024-09-03 20:51:36
2488,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"I didn't take your project, Sarah. I just borrowed some ideas.",2024-09-03 20:54:36
2489,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,Borrowed? You mean you plagiarized my whole presentation!,2024-09-03 20:59:36
2490,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,It's not like you were going to present it well anyway. I just improved it.,2024-09-03 21:03:36
2491,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,How dare you! You know how much time I spent on it.,2024-09-03 21:12:36
2492,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,Maybe you should've spent less time and made it actually good.,2024-09-03 21:20:36
2493,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,Who do you think you are? You can't just steal my work!,2024-09-03 21:30:36
2494,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"Maybe if your work was any good, I'd be more inclined to give you credit.",2024-09-03 21:33:36
2495,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,You're unbelievable! I'm reporting this to the professor.,2024-09-03 21:40:36
2496,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"Go ahead, see if I care. The professor likes me more anyway.",2024-09-03 21:45:36
2497,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,You're delusional if you think you can get away with this.,2024-09-03 21:49:36
2498,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,You're naive if you think the professor will take your side.,2024-09-03 21:57:36
2499,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,"Well, when the plagiarism software flags it, let's see what he says.",2024-09-03 21:59:36
2500,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"Oh please, I'll just tweak a few things and make it look different.",2024-09-03 22:03:36
2501,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,"You're a complete fraud, Josh.",2024-09-03 22:10:36
2502,escalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"Takes one to know one, Sarah. Maybe you should try being original for once.",2024-09-03 22:16:36
2503,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,"I can't believe you actually submitted the group project without consulting us, Jake.",2024-09-03 20:46:39
2504,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,"What do you mean? I finished the last part, so I turned it in. What's the big deal?",2024-09-03 20:54:39
2505,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,"The big deal is that we were supposed to review it together, make sure everything was perfect!",2024-09-03 20:59:39
2506,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_3,"Yeah, Jake. You could've missed something important. We might lose marks because of this.",2024-09-03 21:07:39
2507,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,"Oh please, it's not like you guys were doing much to help anyway. I was carrying the team the whole time!",2024-09-03 21:09:39
2508,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it. We all did our parts, but your attitude is unacceptable.",2024-09-03 21:11:39
2509,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_3,Exactly. This was supposed to be a team effort. You made it about you.,2024-09-03 21:17:39
2510,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the bad guy for trying to get it done on time? Maybe if you had worked harder, I wouldn't have felt the need to submit it myself.",2024-09-03 21:23:39
2511,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,"You're completely missing the point, Jake. It's not just about finishing; it's about doing it together, as a group!",2024-09-03 21:33:39
2512,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_3,"And now, if there's any mistake, we all get to share the blame, thanks to you.",2024-09-03 21:38:39
2513,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,"If there's a mistake—which there won't be—you can blame me, okay? But I don't see why everyone is freaking out over this.",2024-09-03 21:42:39
2514,escalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,Because your selfish actions affect all of us.,2024-09-03 21:45:39
2515,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the extra rehearsal practice yesterday?,2024-09-03 20:54:43
2516,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,I didn't think it was important. You never show up to practice on time anyway.,2024-09-03 20:58:43
2517,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,That's not fair! I had a family emergency last week. How was I supposed to know it wasn’t optional?,2024-09-03 21:08:43
2518,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,Because we all agreed in the group chat. Maybe you should actually read the messages for once.,2024-09-03 21:18:43
2519,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're blaming me for not being glued to my phone? Try telling me in person next time!",2024-09-03 21:19:43
2520,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,Why should I have to go out of my way because you can't be bothered to stay informed?,2024-09-03 21:22:43
2521,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,"Maybe if you weren't so self-righteous, you’d understand other people have lives too!",2024-09-03 21:31:43
2522,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_3,"Both of you, chill out. We're all trying to make this dance recital work. Shouting isn't going to solve anything.",2024-09-03 21:33:43
2523,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one being kept in the dark.",2024-09-03 21:36:43
2524,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,And you're not the one dealing with unreliable teammates!,2024-09-03 21:40:43
2525,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_3,"Look, pointing fingers won't help. Can we at least agree to communicate better?",2024-09-03 21:47:43
2526,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,"Fine, but I'm not taking the full blame for this. We need a better system.",2024-09-03 21:57:43
2527,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,Whatever. Just try to keep up next time.,2024-09-03 22:01:43
2528,escalatory_conversation_171,speaker_3,Can we all just agree to check the chat more often and talk to each other if there's,2024-09-03 22:03:43
2529,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,You really think submitting a group project without consulting everyone is okay?,2024-09-03 20:55:46
2530,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,I had to! None of you were responding to my messages!,2024-09-03 21:01:46
2531,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,Maybe because your plan didn't make any sense?,2024-09-03 21:05:46
2532,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_3,"Hold on, can we at least agree on why we didn't communicate properly?",2024-09-03 21:11:46
2533,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,"There was nothing wrong with my plan, you guys just don't want to put in the effort.",2024-09-03 21:15:46
2534,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,Effort? We've been doing all the work while you disappear for days!,2024-09-03 21:19:46
2535,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_4,"Let's not forget who missed the last two meetings, speaker_2.",2024-09-03 21:28:46
2536,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,Because I had other commitments! Do you expect me to drop everything?,2024-09-03 21:38:46
2537,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,"Yes, if we're going to make this project a priority, then yes!",2024-09-03 21:46:46
2538,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_3,"This isn't going to help, can we find a middle ground?",2024-09-03 21:54:46
2539,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,Maybe if speaker_1 actually tried understanding the constraints I was under.,2024-09-03 21:55:46
2540,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,"Constraints? You didn’t share any constraints, you just decided and moved on.",2024-09-03 22:00:46
2541,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_4,"Both of you need to chill for a second, this isn’t productive.",2024-09-03 22:04:46
2542,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,"Fine, but someone needs to take responsibility for this mess.",2024-09-03 22:08:46
2543,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,"I vote we just move forward with my plan, no more arguments.",2024-09-03 22:09:46
2544,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,That's not happening. We’re going to revisit ideas together.,2024-09-03 22:18:46
2545,escalatory_conversation_172,speaker_3,Let's break down what we have and what’s,2024-09-03 22:27:46
2546,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"I can't believe you missed the deadline for our group project, Steve.",2024-09-03 20:53:51
2547,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Lisa. It's not like you were super helpful either!",2024-09-03 20:57:51
2548,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,Excuse me? I did all the research and organized all the notes!,2024-09-03 21:06:51

2550,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"Fix this? You think it's that simple, Mark? Lisa here left half the work for the last minute.",2024-09-03 21:16:51
2551,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"And you didn't even show up to half the meetings, Steve.",2024-09-03 21:25:51
2552,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_3,Can we just focus on a solution without pointing fingers?,2024-09-03 21:28:51
2553,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Mark. You're just trying to play mediator now.",2024-09-03 21:36:51
2554,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"Yeah, because he's the only one actually trying to make this work!",2024-09-03 21:43:51
2555,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"You know what, Lisa? I'm tired of your self-righteous attitude.",2024-09-03 21:48:51
2556,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"And I'm tired of your laziness, Steve!",2024-09-03 21:50:51
2557,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_3,This isn't getting us anywhere. Let's just split the remaining work and finish it.,2024-09-03 21:55:51
2558,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,Why should I put in more effort now when you both have done nothing but blame me?,2024-09-03 22:03:51
2559,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"Because the project matters more than our petty arguments, Steve!",2024-09-03 22:10:51
2560,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_3,"Steve, just help us get this over with. We can argue later.",2024-09-03 22:12:51
2561,escalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"Fine, but don't expect me to cover for either of you",2024-09-03 22:14:51
2562,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,"Why do you always have to be late, Sam? We're supposed to be a team!",2024-09-03 20:55:55
2563,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Lisa! It’s just a few minutes. What's the big deal?",2024-09-03 21:03:55
2564,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,The big deal is that we're falling behind on this group project because we can't rely on you!,2024-09-03 21:04:55
2565,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_3,"Yeah, Sam. It's not fair that we have to pick up the slack for you every time.",2024-09-03 21:13:55
2566,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you both are ganging up on me? Maybe if the work wasn't so boring, I'd be more motivated to be on time.",2024-09-03 21:20:55
2567,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,"Excuses, excuses. We're all busy, Sam! That’s what being in college is like!",2024-09-03 21:24:55
2568,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,"And maybe if Lisa wasn’t so bossy, this wouldn’t feel like a prison sentence!",2024-09-03 21:32:55
2569,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_3,"Hey, don’t drag Lisa into this. We agreed to divide the work and be here at the same time!",2024-09-03 21:37:55
2570,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,Funny how you both conveniently forget your own mistakes. Like when Lisa missed the last meeting entirely?,2024-09-03 21:42:55
2571,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,"I had a family emergency, and I told you that! That’s not the same as being late every single time!",2024-09-03 21:50:55
2572,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,"Fine, keep blaming me. It's not like this project even matters that much!",2024-09-03 21:56:55
2573,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_3,"That’s not the point! This is about respect and trust, Sam!",2024-09-03 22:04:55
2574,escalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,Respect? Trust? Coming from,2024-09-03 22:12:55
2575,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,Why didn't you follow the game plan? We all agreed on it during the practice.,2024-09-03 20:47:59
2576,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,"The plan wasn't working, so I had to make a quick decision.",2024-09-03 20:57:59
2577,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,A quick decision? You mean you decided to play solo and ignore the rest of the team?,2024-09-03 21:06:59
2578,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_3,"Seriously, we were falling apart because of that. It was a team effort, not a one-man show.",2024-09-03 21:08:59
2579,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,"Maybe if everyone else was putting in half the effort I was, we wouldn't be losing!",2024-09-03 21:11:59
2580,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_4,"Oh come on, you're always trying to be the hero. It's not helping us win; it's tearing us apart.",2024-09-03 21:12:59
2581,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,"And you're saying doing the same thing over and over, even when it fails, is better?",2024-09-03 21:16:59
2582,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,"We had a strategy! Deviating from it without discussing it made it worse, not better.",2024-09-03 21:22:59
2583,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_3,"Yeah, and no one could predict what you were going to do next. It was chaos out there.",2024-09-03 21:28:59
2584,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,Maybe because the strategy sucks! Have you thought of that?,2024-09-03 21:34:59
2585,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_4,"The strategy works, but only if we all stick to it. You're the only one who keeps breaking away.",2024-09-03 21:38:59
2586,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,"We need to trust each other, but you're making it impossible when you go rogue.",2024-09-03 21:42:59
2587,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,Maybe I don't trust a plan that's not working. Did you ever think of that?,2024-09-03 21:47:59
2588,escalatory_conversation_175,speaker_3,It's not about the,2024-09-03 21:50:59
2589,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,"I can't believe you lost the map, Jamie!",2024-09-03 20:48:03
2590,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,"Why is it always my fault, Alex? You were the one who put it down last!",2024-09-03 20:56:03
2591,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_3,"This is ridiculous, both of you! We're lost in the middle of nowhere because neither of you can be responsible.",2024-09-03 21:03:03
2592,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,"Of course you're going to take her side, Sarah! You're always against me!",2024-09-03 21:05:03
2593,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again with your paranoia, Alex. Maybe if you listened for once, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:09:03
2594,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_3,Arguing isn't helping us find our way back. We need to figure this out together.,2024-09-03 21:10:03
2595,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,Easy for you to say when you're not the one being blamed for everything!,2024-09-03 21:13:03
2596,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,"You really need to stop making everything about you. We're all stuck here, remember?",2024-09-03 21:17:03
2597,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_3,This is getting us nowhere. Let's just retrace our steps and see if we can find some landmarks.,2024-09-03 21:19:03
2598,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,Retrace our steps? We don't even know where we started from!,2024-09-03 21:23:03
2599,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,"Maybe if you paid more attention instead of constantly complaining, we'd have a better idea.",2024-09-03 21:33:03
2600,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_3,Can we please just focus on solving the problem instead of tearing each other apart?,2024-09-03 21:38:03
2601,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,"Fine, you two figure it out since I'm apparently useless.",2024-09-03 21:48:03
2602,escalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,"That's not what anyone said, Alex. We just need you to be part of the solution,",2024-09-03 21:56:03
2603,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead without consulting me first!,2024-09-03 20:55:06
2604,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go. I did what had to be done; you were taking too long!",2024-09-03 20:58:06
2605,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,That's not an excuse to ignore my input! We agreed to make decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:04:06
2606,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you responded to messages faster, I wouldn't have to make decisions on my own.",2024-09-03 21:07:06
2607,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,Are you serious? I've been juggling five different tasks while you were just focused on this one!,2024-09-03 21:12:06
2608,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,And whose fault is that? You always overcommit and then act surprised when you can't keep up.,2024-09-03 21:15:06
2609,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"Maybe if you picked up some slack, I wouldn't have to overcommit in the first place!",2024-09-03 21:17:06
2610,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"Oh please, I've done more than enough, but you're always playing the martyr.",2024-09-03 21:23:06
2611,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"You know what? I'm tired of this blame game. We are partners, yet you constantly undermine me.",2024-09-03 21:33:06
2612,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,And I'm tired of you acting like the only one who knows what's best for this team.,2024-09-03 21:43:06
2613,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"If you think I'm so incompetent, why don't you just handle everything yourself?",2024-09-03 21:49:06
2614,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,Maybe I will! At least things will get done without the constant waiting and second-guessing.,2024-09-03 21:53:06
2615,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"Fine, go ahead. But don't come crying to me when you realize you can't do it all alone.",2024-09-03 22:00:06
2616,escalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"Trust me, I won't need to.",2024-09-03 22:07:06
2617,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,"You never consult with any of us before making a decision, Jessica. It's like we're not even on the same team!",2024-09-03 20:52:10
2618,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Mark. Someone has to take charge. We can't sit around discussing every single detail all day.",2024-09-03 20:55:10
2619,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_3,"But that's exactly the problem, Jessica. You always think you're the only one who knows what's best.",2024-09-03 20:57:10
2620,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"So what, Sarah? Maybe because I actually get things done while you two bicker over nonsense.",2024-09-03 21:00:10
2621,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,This isn't nonsense! We deserve to have a say too. We're supposed to be working together on this group project.,2024-09-03 21:02:10
2622,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"If we did everything your way, we'd never meet the deadline. I'm trying to keep us on track!",2024-09-03 21:06:10
2623,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_3,By ignoring our input? What's the point of being in a group if you're the only one making decisions?,2024-09-03 21:13:10
2624,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,Exactly. You're acting like we're just here to follow your orders. That's not how a team works!,2024-09-03 21:20:10
2625,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"Maybe if you two actually contributed something useful, I wouldn't have to make all the calls myself!",2024-09-03 21:21:10
2626,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_3,"Useful? We've given plenty of ideas, but you just dismiss them!",2024-09-03 21:27:10
2627,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"Only because they're impractical and would slow us down. We need efficiency, not endless debates.",2024-09-03 21:28:10
2628,escalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,"That's not an excuse to shut us out. We're smart too, you know. We have good ideas if you'd bother to listen.",2024-09-03 21:31:10
2629,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"You know what, Sam? I am sick of always being the one who has to clean up the kitchen after our shifts.",2024-09-03 20:49:13
2630,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Alex. You're acting like you're the only one who has to do any cleaning. I do my part too!",2024-09-03 20:54:13
2631,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,Really? Because it sure doesn't feel that way when I'm stuck doing the dishes every single night!,2024-09-03 20:55:13
2632,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't act like a martyr about it, I'd be more inclined to help out!",2024-09-03 20:59:13
2633,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_3,"Guys, what’s going on here? Why are you both shouting in the middle of dinner service?",2024-09-03 21:08:13
2634,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"Tony, tell Sam that it's ridiculous I'm always stuck with the closing routine. It's unfair!",2024-09-03 21:15:13
2635,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,And you tell Alex that they're exaggerating. I clean up too!,2024-09-03 21:25:13
2636,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_3,"Look, we all have our roles. Just because Alex mentions it more doesn’t mean it’s not an issue.",2024-09-03 21:26:13
2637,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"Thank you! See, Sam? Even Tony sees you're not doing enough.",2024-09-03 21:28:13
2638,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,"This is absurd. I clean the grill and the fryers, which are way worse than a few dishes, by the way.",2024-09-03 21:37:13
2639,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"Oh, please. We both know those jobs take half the time of scrubbing everything else.",2024-09-03 21:39:13
2640,escalatory_conversation_179,speaker_3,You know what? Both of you need to just stop. We can sort this out like adults without dragging everyone else into it.,2024-09-03 21:49:13
2641,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,"We need to talk about the group project, Alex. It's due in two days and you haven't done your part.",2024-09-03 20:50:16
2642,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break, Jason. I've been dealing with a lot of stuff lately.",2024-09-03 20:54:16
2643,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,"We all have, but that doesn't mean you can just slack off and leave all the work to us!",2024-09-03 21:01:16
2644,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,"Yeah, Alex, this isn't fair to the rest of us. We're all busting our butts over here.",2024-09-03 21:07:16
2645,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,"You guys always gang up on me. Maybe if the project outline wasn't so vague, I'd know what to do.",2024-09-03 21:17:16
2646,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,"The outline was clear enough. Maybe if you showed up to the meetings, you'd understand it better.",2024-09-03 21:21:16
2647,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,"Exactly. Every time we ask for your input, you're either silent or absent.",2024-09-03 21:27:16
2648,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,"Maybe if you guys actually listened to my ideas instead of shooting them down, I'd be more involved!",2024-09-03 21:28:16
2649,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,Your ideas aren't practical for what we're trying to achieve. That's why we don't use them.,2024-09-03 21:35:16
2650,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,We're trying to follow the grading rubric. It's not about who has the flashiest idea.,2024-09-03 21:37:16
2651,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm not practical or flashy enough? Great, thanks for the vote of confidence.",2024-09-03 21:47:16
2652,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,"Stop twisting our words, Alex. This is about contributing to the work, not your ego.",2024-09-03 21:52:16
2653,escalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,We're stressing out because this project is important,2024-09-03 21:53:16

2655,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. I show up, don't I?",2024-09-03 20:55:20
2656,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_3,"Showing up isn't enough! You barely rehearse your parts, and we always have to spend extra time on you.",2024-09-03 20:59:20
2657,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,"Maybe if you guys gave me some space, I'd get better. You all act like I'm the only problem.",2024-09-03 21:09:20
2658,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_1,The concert is in two weeks. We can't afford to have you messing up.,2024-09-03 21:17:20
2659,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,Why is it always 'me messing up'? What about Mark constantly being late?,2024-09-03 21:26:20
2660,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_4,"Hey, leave me out of this! I'm not the one who plays out of tune half the time.",2024-09-03 21:28:20
2661,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,"Oh really, Mark? At least I'm not offbeat like you!",2024-09-03 21:31:20
2662,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_1,"This is getting us nowhere. We need to focus on improving, not pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 21:38:20
2663,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_3,"Jake, seriously, can you at least try to learn your parts before practice?",2024-09-03 21:48:20
2664,escalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,"I have a job, you know! Not all of us have endless free time.",2024-09-03 21:51:20

2668,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,I can't believe you threw out my art project without asking me first!,2024-09-03 20:48:23
2669,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,Your art project was taking up the entire dining table for weeks. We needed the space.,2024-09-03 20:51:23
2670,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,But I was almost done! You couldn't wait a couple more days?,2024-09-03 20:56:23
2671,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,How was I supposed to know that? You never update me on your progress.,2024-09-03 21:01:23
2672,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,"Maybe because every time I try to talk to you, you just ignore me or change the subject.",2024-09-03 21:11:23
2673,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,"That's not true, and you know it. You're just so absorbed in your own world.",2024-09-03 21:14:23

2675,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,My excuse? I'm running this household! You think that's easy with all your clutter around?,2024-09-03 21:28:23
2676,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,My art is not clutter! Just because you don't understand it doesn't give you the right to throw it away.,2024-09-03 21:33:23
2677,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,"Understand it? I can't even see it through all the mess. Maybe if you kept your things organized, this wouldn't have happened.",2024-09-03 21:38:23
2678,escalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,"Organized? I had everything in place. You just refuse to see beyond your narrow view of ""clean.""",2024-09-03 21:45:23

2749,escalatory_conversation_187,speaker_2,Maybe it's because I actually put in the effort instead of slacking off and expecting others to pick up the slack.,2024-09-03 21:30:39

2751,escalatory_conversation_187,speaker_2,Late nights? I think you've just been using that as an excuse to cover up your lack of dedication.,2024-09-03 21:32:39

2755,escalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,Oh really? And what about the trash? You've let it overflow three times this week!,2024-09-03 21:01:42
2756,escalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,"Maybe because I'm busy doing everything else around here, like your laundry!",2024-09-03 21:11:42

2766,escalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,At least I'm trying to keep this place livable. What do you do besides criticize?,2024-09-03 22:11:42
2767,escalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,I'm trying to keep us afloat financially while you go on random shopping sprees!,2024-09-03 22:21:42

2769,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking?,2024-09-03 20:49:46
2770,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,"Because I wanted it, and there wasn't any left for me last time!",2024-09-03 20:59:46

2778,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,Because you'd just dismiss it like you always do!,2024-09-03 21:51:46
2779,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,That's not fair. I didn't even know you felt this way.,2024-09-03 21:58:46
2780,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,Maybe you would if you paid more attention instead of always thinking about yourself.,2024-09-03 22:05:46
2781,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,You're twisting this around to make me the bad guy when all I wanted was a simple answer.,2024-09-03 22:08:46
2782,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,The simple answer is that I'm tired of feeling like I come second to everything else in your life!,2024-09-03 22:18:46
2783,escalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,That's not true and you know it. You mean a lot to me.,2024-09-03 22:19:46

2789,escalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,"And maybe if you bothered to ask before making arbitrary changes, there wouldn't be so many bugs.",2024-09-03 21:16:49
2790,escalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,Ask you? It's not like you listen to anyone's feedback anyway.,2024-09-03 21:20:49
2791,escalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,Feedback? All you do is criticize without offering solutions.,2024-09-03 21:25:49
2792,escalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,Because your solutions are half-baked! Someone has to keep this project from falling apart.,2024-09-03 21:30:49

2796,escalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,Maybe we should just go to the manager and see who’s really at fault here.,2024-09-03 21:59:49
2797,escalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,Fine by me. Let's see how you explain your solo act to them.,2024-09-03 22:09:49
2798,escalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,And let's see how you explain your absenteeism and missed deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:11:49

2803,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,My sources? I've been giving input the whole time!,2024-09-03 21:00:53
2804,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_1,Input? Random comments don't count as doing work. We have a presentation tomorrow!,2024-09-03 21:03:53

2807,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,That's not fair! I've had other priorities. Sometimes it's hard to manage everything.,2024-09-03 21:13:53
2808,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_1,"We all have other priorities, but we manage to contribute! What's your excuse?",2024-09-03 21:17:53
2809,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,"You know what? Maybe if the project wasn't so disorganized, I would have been more motivated.",2024-09-03 21:24:53
2810,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_3,Disorganized? That's rich coming from someone who didn't even show up to meetings!,2024-09-03 21:33:53
2811,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,Meetings that always got scheduled last minute! How am I supposed to plan for that?,2024-09-03 21:34:53
2812,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_1,We used the group chat to coordinate. You just ignored the messages!,2024-09-03 21:44:53
2813,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,Ignored? I was busy! Do you think I live on my phone?,2024-09-03 21:52:53
2814,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_3,"We're all busy. But we still made time because it's important. Clearly, you don't care.",2024-09-03 21:53:53
2815,escalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,That's,2024-09-03 22:02:53
2816,escalatory_conversation_192,speaker_1,"You never pull your weight in group projects, Amanda! It's unfair to the rest of us.",2024-09-03 20:50:58

2823,escalatory_conversation_192,speaker_2,Those weren't mistakes; those were your suggested changes that didn't make any sense!,2024-09-03 21:27:58

2828,escalatory_conversation_192,speaker_3,Appreciation and fairness,2024-09-03 22:02:58
2829,escalatory_conversation_193,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and talked to the professor about our group project without telling us!,2024-09-03 20:56:02

2837,escalatory_conversation_193,speaker_1,That's part of the process! Discussing and deciding things as a team.,2024-09-03 21:30:02
2838,escalatory_conversation_193,speaker_3,Now we have to explain why we aren't sticking to what you told the professor.,2024-09-03 21:35:02

2874,escalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,I’m not admitting anything. You’re being ridiculous.,2024-09-03 22:15:08
2875,escalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,You think I,2024-09-03 22:25:08
2876,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Why did you take my project idea and present it as your own?,2024-09-03 20:49:12
2877,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I didn't steal anything from you.,2024-09-03 20:52:12
2878,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Don't play dumb. You used my research and passed it off as your original work.,2024-09-03 21:01:12

2882,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Inspiration? You copied entire sections verbatim!,2024-09-03 21:27:12
2883,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_3,This isn't helping. Can we all just sit down and talk this out?,2024-09-03 21:34:12
2884,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,Talk out what? They’re overreacting!,2024-09-03 21:35:12
2885,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Overreacting? You’ve jeopardized my chances of passing this class!,2024-09-03 21:41:12
2886,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_3,Accusations won't solve anything. We need to figure out a solution.,2024-09-03 21:43:12
2887,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Fine. How do you suggest we fix this then?,2024-09-03 21:46:12
2888,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,I'm not changing my project now. It's already submitted.,2024-09-03 21:50:12
2889,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_3,Maybe we can approach the professor together and explain what happened.,2024-09-03 21:55:12
2890,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,And say what? That they’re a cheat?,2024-09-03 21:57:12
2891,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,I didn't cheat! I just didn't know it would be such a big deal.,2024-09-03 22:04:12
2892,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_3,What if we propose doing some extra credit work to the professor?,2024-09-03 22:14:12
2893,escalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Extra credit? Will that,2024-09-03 22:23:12
2894,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,You always take the biggest share of the profits without even discussing it with the rest of us.,2024-09-03 20:50:15
2895,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,That's because I put in the most work and I take the most risk. It's only fair.,2024-09-03 20:57:15
2896,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,Fair? How is it fair when we agreed to split things equally from the start?,2024-09-03 21:01:15
2897,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_3,"Yeah, we all put in effort. It's not like you're the only one doing anything.",2024-09-03 21:05:15
2898,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,"Oh please, like you two do half of what I do. You just sit back and wait for the money to roll in.",2024-09-03 21:07:15
2899,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,"That's not true and you know it. We all have roles, and without any one of us, this wouldn't even work.",2024-09-03 21:09:15
2900,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_3,Exactly! Just because you're the face of the business doesn't mean you get to hoard all the benefits.,2024-09-03 21:13:15
2901,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,Being the face also means dealing with all the problems and pressures you two never see.,2024-09-03 21:16:15
2902,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,"We all deal with problems, but we solve them together. You're not the only one feeling the pressure.",2024-09-03 21:22:15
2903,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_3,We need to discuss these things as a team. Just taking the majority without talking to us is unfair and disrespectful.,2024-09-03 21:23:15
2904,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,"Fine, but if you want more money, then step up and take on some of my burdens. Let's see how you manage.",2024-09-03 21:32:15
2905,escalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,"We're willing to take on more if it means a fair share, but this attitude needs to stop",2024-09-03 21:39:15

2907,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,"Because every time I pass to you, you always mess it up!",2024-09-03 21:02:18
2908,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,"That's not true, I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:04:18
2909,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_3,Can you two stop blaming each other? We're losing because we're not working as a team!,2024-09-03 21:08:18
2910,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,"Maybe if someone wasn't hogging the ball all the time, we would be!",2024-09-03 21:16:18
2911,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault we're losing? That's rich.",2024-09-03 21:18:18
2912,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_3,Enough! Pointing fingers isn't helping. We need to focus on the game.,2024-09-03 21:25:18
2913,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,Maybe we wouldn't need to if some people pulled their weight!,2024-09-03 21:29:18
2914,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,"And maybe if others didn't keep showing off and actually played properly, we'd get somewhere!",2024-09-03 21:38:18
2915,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_3,"Seriously, guys, this is getting us nowhere. We're falling apart.",2024-09-03 21:46:18
2916,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,It's hard not to fall apart when one person thinks he's the whole team.,2024-09-03 21:47:18
2917,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,Better than being someone who just runs their mouth and does nothing!,2024-09-03 21:49:18
2918,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_3,Stop it right now! We have to figure this out together.,2024-09-03 21:57:18
2919,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,"Whatever, I'm done trying to fix this mess.",2024-09-03 22:03:18
2920,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,"You're just running away, as usual. Typical Alex.",2024-09-03 22:12:18

2922,escalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,Fine,2024-09-03 22:29:18
2923,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,"Why did you take my notebook without asking, Emma?",2024-09-03 20:53:21
2924,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"I needed it for class, and you weren't using it.",2024-09-03 21:02:21
2925,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,That's not the point! You should have asked first.,2024-09-03 21:09:21
2926,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"Well, maybe I'd ask if you weren't always so unapproachable.",2024-09-03 21:11:21
2927,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,Unapproachable? You're the one always avoiding conversations.,2024-09-03 21:18:21
2928,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"That's because every time I try to talk, you blow up at me like this!",2024-09-03 21:27:21
2929,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,I blow up because you keep doing inconsiderate things!,2024-09-03 21:37:21
2930,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the inconsiderate one? What about you ignoring my messages all the time?",2024-09-03 21:42:21
2931,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,"I ignore your messages because they're always about you needing something, never asking how I am!",2024-09-03 21:49:21
2932,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"Maybe I would, if you'd ever show some interest in my life too!",2024-09-03 21:53:21
2933,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,This isn’t about my interest in your life. It's about you respecting my things.,2024-09-03 21:55:21
2934,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"Respect goes both ways, you know. You're not exactly the most considerate roommate.",2024-09-03 22:02:21
2935,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,What are you talking about? I always clean up after myself.,2024-09-03 22:09:21
2936,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"Sure, but you also blast your music at 2 AM when I have early classes!",2024-09-03 22:11:21
2937,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,That's not the same as taking someone's belongings without asking!,2024-09-03 22:15:21
2938,escalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,It's part of a bigger issue of you not considering how your actions affect others.,2024-09-03 22:23:21
2939,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,Why did you submit that report without consulting any of us first?,2024-09-03 20:54:24
2940,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,Because nobody else was stepping up and the deadline was looming. Someone had to do it.,2024-09-03 21:00:24
2941,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,But you included data that we hadn't verified yet! That's irresponsible.,2024-09-03 21:07:24
2942,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,It's not like any of you were helping with the verification process. I didn't have a choice.,2024-09-03 21:15:24
2943,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,You always take over things without asking. We're supposed to be a team!,2024-09-03 21:19:24
2944,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,And what's the team supposed to do when no one else takes initiative? Wait until we all fail?,2024-09-03 21:22:24
2945,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,We could at least discuss it instead of making unilateral decisions.,2024-09-03 21:30:24
2946,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,"Discuss it? We've been ""discussing"" for weeks with no progress. Action was needed.",2024-09-03 21:38:24
2947,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,That still doesn't justify submitting incomplete and possibly incorrect information. It makes us all look bad.,2024-09-03 21:39:24
2948,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,You know what's worse? Missing deadlines because nobody can agree on anything.,2024-09-03 21:43:24
2949,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,"There were better ways to handle this, like dividing the work and verifying together.",2024-09-03 21:44:24
2950,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,And whose fault is it that nobody took on their share of the work before?,2024-09-03 21:53:24
2951,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,Shifting blame doesn't help. You should have communicated with us before taking such a drastic step.,2024-09-03 21:58:24
2952,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I should have. But at least I was trying to save the project.",2024-09-03 22:05:24
2953,escalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,Trying to save it by potentially sinking it with,2024-09-03 22:10:24
2954,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,Did you really just use my paintbrush without asking?,2024-09-03 20:52:27
2955,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"I mean, it was just sitting there. What's the big deal?",2024-09-03 21:00:27
2956,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,The big deal is it's mine! You shouldn't touch other people's stuff.,2024-09-03 21:02:27
2957,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"Relax, it's just a paintbrush. You're overreacting.",2024-09-03 21:07:27
2958,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,"Overreacting? You always do stuff like this, and I'm sick of it!",2024-09-03 21:13:27
2959,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"Oh, so I'm always the bad guy now? You're the one making a mountain out of a molehill.",2024-09-03 21:22:27
2960,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,"Maybe if you respected other people's things, we wouldn't be having this argument.",2024-09-03 21:32:27
2961,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,Respect? Funny coming from you. Remember last week when you borrowed my markers and ruined them?,2024-09-03 21:39:27
2962,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,"That was an accident, and I apologized! You didn't even care until now.",2024-09-03 21:41:27
2963,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,Apologized? You barely said sorry. And now you're acting all high and mighty.,2024-09-03 21:49:27
2964,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,This isn't about me. This is about you not respecting my stuff!,2024-09-03 21:50:27
2965,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"Fine, whatever! If it's such a big deal, just buy a new brush.",2024-09-03 22:00:27
2966,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,That's not the point! The point is you need to ask before taking things.,2024-09-03 22:04:27
2967,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,I'm done talking to you. This is ridiculous.,2024-09-03 22:08:27
2968,escalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,"Of course you are. Running away when things get tough, as usual.",2024-09-03 22:15:27
2969,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,"You always do this, Maria! Why can't you ever be on time?",2024-09-03 20:48:29
2970,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so controlling, Jake, I'd actually want to be here on time!",2024-09-03 20:50:29
2971,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,Controlling? I'm just trying to keep us on track! We have deadlines!,2024-09-03 21:00:29
2972,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,Deadlines? All you care about is your precious schedule. What about our sanity?,2024-09-03 21:10:29
2973,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,"Our sanity? You mean your laziness, right?",2024-09-03 21:15:29
2974,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,Laziness? Perhaps I'm just tired of you barking orders every single day!,2024-09-03 21:21:29
2975,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,"And I'm tired of picking up your slack! If you can't handle this job, maybe you should leave!",2024-09-03 21:26:29
2976,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,Maybe I should! At least then I wouldn't have to deal with your constant nagging!,2024-09-03 21:31:29
2977,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,"Fine, leave! See if I care!",2024-09-03 21:41:29
2978,escalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,"Oh, I will. Don't worry, I won't miss you one bit!",2024-09-03 21:47:29
2979,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were going to the client meeting without me?,2024-09-03 20:49:32
2980,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,Because you were late again! We can't keep waiting on you.,2024-09-03 20:56:32
2981,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,I texted you that I was stuck in traffic! You could have waited a few more minutes.,2024-09-03 21:00:32
2982,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,"A few more minutes? Last time we waited, it turned into half an hour. We can't keep risking it.",2024-09-03 21:01:32
2983,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,So now you're just making decisions without me?,2024-09-03 21:05:32
2984,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,"When your lateness affects the entire team, yes!",2024-09-03 21:11:32
2985,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,This is unbelievable. Do you think I enjoy being late? It's out of my control sometimes.,2024-09-03 21:14:32
2986,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,"It's not just 'sometimes,' it's every single time. We're all tired of compensating for you.",2024-09-03 21:21:32
2987,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,"Maybe if you communicated better, I wouldn't feel so blindsided!",2024-09-03 21:31:32
2988,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my communication that’s the problem? What about your lack of punctuality?",2024-09-03 21:41:32
2989,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,"If we had clearer expectations and some flexibility, this wouldn’t be such an issue.",2024-09-03 21:48:32
2990,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,Flexibility? How about you respect everyone else's time for once?,2024-09-03 21:54:32
2991,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,How about you don't make executive decisions without consulting me?,2024-09-03 22:03:32
2992,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more reliable, I'd feel more inclined to consult you!",2024-09-03 22:08:32
2993,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,"And maybe if you valued teamwork, you wouldn't go rogue every chance you get!",2024-09-03 22:15:32
2994,escalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,Going,2024-09-03 22:25:32
2995,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you say anything during the presentation, Tom? You left me hanging!",2024-09-03 20:55:36
2996,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,"Because you took over everything, Sarah. There was no point in me saying anything.",2024-09-03 21:00:36
2997,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,"That’s not true! I paused several times for you to jump in, but you just sat there.",2024-09-03 21:10:36
2998,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,"You didn’t pause, you just rambled on. You can’t even follow the slides properly.",2024-09-03 21:13:36
2999,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it’s my fault that you don’t know how to communicate?",2024-09-03 21:19:36
3000,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,My communication was fine; it’s your domineering attitude that’s the problem.,2024-09-03 21:25:36
3001,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_3,"Guys, the client wasn’t impressed. We need to figure this out together.",2024-09-03 21:30:36
3002,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,It’s hard to figure anything out when Tom won’t participate.,2024-09-03 21:32:36
3003,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,I don’t participate because you don’t let me. You always have to be the center of attention.,2024-09-03 21:33:36
3004,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_3,This isn’t helping. Can we just agree that we need better coordination next time?,2024-09-03 21:38:36
3005,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,Coordination won’t help if Tom refuses to step up.,2024-09-03 21:43:36
3006,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,And it won’t help if Sarah thinks she’s the only one who knows anything.,2024-09-03 21:47:36
3007,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_3,"Alright, we’ve identified the problem. What do we do to fix it?",2024-09-03 21:48:36
3008,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,Maybe Tom should actually prepare for the presentation next time.,2024-09-03 21:54:36
3009,escalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,And maybe Sarah should learn to share the spotlight,2024-09-03 21:59:36
3010,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 20:49:38
3011,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,"I had something come up. Besides, it's not like you always show up either.",2024-09-03 20:53:38
3012,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,"That's not fair. I've missed one meeting, but you miss all the time!",2024-09-03 20:54:38
3013,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_3,Can we all just focus on getting the project done? Accusations aren't helping.,2024-09-03 21:01:38
3014,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,Easy for you to say. You barely contribute and then try to play peacemaker.,2024-09-03 21:07:38
3015,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_3,"That's not true. I always do my part. Maybe if we all communicated better, we wouldn't have these issues.",2024-09-03 21:16:38
3016,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,Communication wouldn't be a problem if some people actually cared about the project.,2024-09-03 21:23:38
3017,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,Oh really? Just because I have other commitments doesn't mean I don't care.,2024-09-03 21:30:38
3018,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_3,"Let's set a regular schedule that everyone can agree on. Otherwise, we're just going to keep arguing.",2024-09-03 21:39:38
3019,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,I'm tired of rearranging my schedule for people who don't show up anyway.,2024-09-03 21:43:38
3020,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I'll just do my part separately and hand it in without discussing it with you two.",2024-09-03 21:52:38
3021,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_3,That's not going to help us look like a team. We'll get a lower grade.,2024-09-03 21:58:38
3022,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,"Maybe if we had more reliable team members, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 22:07:38
3023,escalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,"Maybe if you'd stop acting like you're above everyone else, we wouldn’t have this drama.",2024-09-03 22:12:38
3024,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,I can't believe you went to Mr. Thompson and complained about the project without telling me!,2024-09-03 20:51:41
3025,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,"I had to, you're not pulling your weight, and it's affecting our grades!",2024-09-03 20:57:41
3026,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,Are you serious? I've been working my butt off while you slack off!,2024-09-03 21:07:41
3027,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,"That's a joke! Your part is barely done, and it's half-hearted at best!",2024-09-03 21:17:41
3028,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,"If you think it's so bad, why didn't you say anything while we were working on it?",2024-09-03 21:22:41
3029,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,"Because every time I tried to say something, you just brushed me off!",2024-09-03 21:31:41
3030,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,Maybe because your ideas were completely useless and would've made things worse!,2024-09-03 21:41:41
3031,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,Useless? At least I have ideas! You just do the bare minimum and expect me to fix everything!,2024-09-03 21:45:41
3032,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,"Oh please, you wouldn't even know what to do without copying everything from me!",2024-09-03 21:55:41
3033,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,Copying from you? Get real! I'm the one who actually understands the material!,2024-09-03 22:00:41
3034,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,"And yet you still needed me to finish the hardest parts. Funny how that works, isn't it?",2024-09-03 22:04:41
3035,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,You know what? I'm done arguing. It’s clear you can't handle constructive criticism.,2024-09-03 22:05:41
3036,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,"Fine, go cry to Mr. Thompson again like a baby. I'm sure that'll solve everything.",2024-09-03 22:09:41
3037,escalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,At least he'll know who's really at fault here.,2024-09-03 22:13:41
3038,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,"You always bail on plans at the last minute, it's so frustrating!",2024-09-03 20:52:47
3039,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"That's not true, I had a legitimate reason for canceling last night.",2024-09-03 21:02:47
3040,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,"A ""legitimate reason""? You just never follow through on anything!",2024-09-03 21:09:47
3041,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,Oh really? Like you've never flaked on me? Remember last weekend?,2024-09-03 21:12:47
3042,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,That was one time! You're doing it constantly.,2024-09-03 21:22:47
3043,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you considered other people's schedules, it wouldn’t be an issue.",2024-09-03 21:27:47
3044,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,"Maybe if you actually committed to something, it wouldn't be an issue!",2024-09-03 21:36:47
3045,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,I do commit! You're the one who's always making ridiculous plans that no one can keep up with.,2024-09-03 21:43:47
3046,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,Ridiculous plans? I just want us to spend time together. Is that really so hard to ask?,2024-09-03 21:49:47
3047,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"Not hard to ask, but hard to execute with your impossible standards.",2024-09-03 21:58:47
3048,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,My standards? All I ask is for some consistency!,2024-09-03 22:04:47
3049,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,Consistency? Like you consistently nagging every time we have a disagreement?,2024-09-03 22:12:47
3050,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,Maybe I wouldn't nag if you didn't give me reasons to!,2024-09-03 22:13:47
3051,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,Maybe you should get off my back and stop being so controlling!,2024-09-03 22:20:47
3052,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,Controlling? I just want to make sure we stay close and actually see each other!,2024-09-03 22:26:47
3053,escalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"Well, it feels like you're smothering me!",2024-09-03 22:32:47
3054,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,"Why is the project's budget spreadsheet such a mess, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:50:51
3055,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,"Don't pin this all on me, Maria. It's a team effort, remember?",2024-09-03 20:57:51
3056,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,"Yeah, a team effort that you were supposed to lead and manage. What's your excuse?",2024-09-03 21:04:51
3057,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,"Maybe if the team actually met deadlines, I wouldn't be scrambling to fix their mistakes!",2024-09-03 21:13:51
3058,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_3,"Whoa, hold on. It's not fair to blame the whole team. We've all been working hard despite the confusion.",2024-09-03 21:14:51
3059,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,Confusion? More like disorganization. This project's reputation is on the line!,2024-09-03 21:19:51
3060,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,"It's easy to point fingers, Maria. But where were you when we needed oversight?",2024-09-03 21:20:51
3061,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_3,"Seriously, Alex? Maria's been handling client communications non-stop. What's your role in this?",2024-09-03 21:23:51
3062,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,My role? Trying to decipher everyone's half-baked submissions is what I've been doing!,2024-09-03 21:27:51
3063,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,"Enough with the excuses. We need solutions, not complaints. Can we just agree on some accountability here?",2024-09-03 21:32:51
3064,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,Fine. I'll own up to some of the mess. But I'm not cleaning up alone.,2024-09-03 21:33:51
3065,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_3,"We're all in this together, like it or not. Can we please focus on fixing it rather than fighting?",2024-09-03 21:37:51
3066,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,Alright. How about we set a meeting to reorganize the tasks and get back on track?,2024-09-03 21:46:51
3067,escalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,That actually sounds reasonable. I'm in,2024-09-03 21:49:51
3068,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,I can't believe you volunteered me to be the group leader without asking!,2024-09-03 20:51:54
3069,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to step up, and you weren't exactly volunteering yourself.",2024-09-03 20:59:54
3070,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,That's not the point! You should have at least asked me first.,2024-09-03 21:04:54
3071,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. It's not like you had anything better to do.",2024-09-03 21:07:54
3072,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,Can both of you just stop it? This isn't helping us finish the project.,2024-09-03 21:17:54
3073,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,Easy for you to say. You're not the one who got stuck with extra work.,2024-09-03 21:18:54
3074,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,You act like it's some huge burden. Grow up!,2024-09-03 21:22:54
3075,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn't working. We need to get back on track.",2024-09-03 21:27:54
3076,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,I'm sick of always being the one who has to deal with everyone's mess.,2024-09-03 21:32:54
3077,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,Maybe that's because you're the only one who thinks they're always right!,2024-09-03 21:42:54
3078,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,Enough! We're wasting time. Can we just get back to the task at hand?,2024-09-03 21:48:54
3079,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,"Fine, but don't expect me to take any more of your crap, speaker_2.",2024-09-03 21:50:54
3080,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,"Whatever, as long as you do your part.",2024-09-03 22:00:54
3081,escalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,Let's just get this done. We've already wasted enough time arguing.,2024-09-03 22:06:54
3082,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,I told you we need to rehearse more often if we want to win the talent show!,2024-09-03 20:52:57
3083,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! We already practice enough. You're just being paranoid.",2024-09-03 20:56:57
3084,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,Paranoid? We forgot half the choreography last time!,2024-09-03 20:59:57
3085,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't change the routine every other day, we wouldn't forget!",2024-09-03 21:02:57
3086,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_3,Can you both stop arguing? We're wasting time!,2024-09-03 21:09:57
3087,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,"I'm not arguing, I'm trying to make sure we don't embarrass ourselves on stage!",2024-09-03 21:13:57
3088,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,"Well, if you're so concerned about embarrassment, maybe you should step up your game instead of blaming us!",2024-09-03 21:17:57
3089,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,Excuse me? I've been carrying this whole team!,2024-09-03 21:23:57
3090,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_3,"Enough! This isn't helping! We need to find a solution, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:26:57
3091,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,"Fine, what's your brilliant solution then, since you obviously know everything?",2024-09-03 21:31:57
3092,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_3,"How about we set a fixed schedule and stick to it, rather than adjusting every single day?",2024-09-03 21:35:57
3093,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,A fixed schedule is useless if people don't show up on time.,2024-09-03 21:39:57
3094,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,Are you implying I've been late? Because I've been here just as much as you have.,2024-09-03 21:40:57
3095,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_3,"This isn't about pointing fingers. If we don't work together, we're going to lose for sure.",2024-09-03 21:45:57
3096,escalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,"Alright, let's compromise. We'll stick to one routine, but practice daily.",2024-09-03 21:55:57
3097,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for our group project meeting again, Alex.",2024-09-03 20:55:00
3098,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault the project is a mess? Maybe if Emma here didn't hog the entire project.",2024-09-03 21:01:00
3099,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_3,Excuse me? I'm doing most of the work because neither of you are reliable.,2024-09-03 21:04:00
3100,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,Reliable? I've been to every meeting while you two keep arguing over everything!,2024-09-03 21:09:00
3101,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,"That's rich coming from you, who didn't even finish their part on time.",2024-09-03 21:18:00
3102,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,I had other assignments! At least I communicate my delays.,2024-09-03 21:22:00
3103,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_3,"Let's face it, we're all terrible at managing this project. But Alex, you never even respond to messages.",2024-09-03 21:27:00
3104,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,Maybe because I'm sick of being left out of every decision!,2024-09-03 21:31:00
3105,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,Left out? You've missed three meetings. How are we supposed to include you?,2024-09-03 21:37:00
3106,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,Maybe if meetings were scheduled when I could actually attend.,2024-09-03 21:38:00
3107,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_3,We agreed on those times together! You said they were fine.,2024-09-03 21:44:00
3108,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,"Fine for a while, but my schedule's changed. Not that either of you care.",2024-09-03 21:46:00
3109,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,"We could have adjusted if you'd told us, instead of skipping.",2024-09-03 21:54:00
3110,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_3,And then blaming your absence on us. That’s not fair.,2024-09-03 22:00:00
3111,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,Fair? Like when you both ignored my suggestions for the marketing plan?,2024-09-03 22:08:00
3112,escalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,We didn't ignore them;,2024-09-03 22:12:00
3113,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up to the group meeting last night, Alex? We really needed your input on the presentation.",2024-09-03 20:55:03
3114,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"I have other stuff going on, Dave. I can't always drop everything for these meetings. Why didn't anyone else handle it?",2024-09-03 21:03:03
3115,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,Because you're the one who volunteered to design the slides! How are we supposed to do our parts without the slides you promised?,2024-09-03 21:07:03
3116,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"Oh come on, like what you all do is so important that it can't wait a day or two for my slides. Get off my back!",2024-09-03 21:10:03
3117,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on getting this done? Fighting won't help us finish the presentation on time.",2024-09-03 21:11:03
3118,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,"No, Chris! This is a pattern with Alex. Every time something's on the line, he vanishes and leaves us hanging!",2024-09-03 21:21:03
3119,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"It's not like I'm sitting around doing nothing, Dave! I have other commitments too, you know. Maybe you should have some respect for that!",2024-09-03 21:27:03
3120,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_3,"Both of you need to chill. We're all under stress here, but arguing won't help.",2024-09-03 21:29:03
3121,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Chris. You haven't had to deal with Alex's excuses as much as I have. It's exhausting!",2024-09-03 21:32:03
3122,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm just an excuse to you? Nice to know what you really think. Maybe I should just step back entirely if you feel that way.",2024-09-03 21:36:03
3123,escalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,Maybe,2024-09-03 21:45:03
3124,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 20:50:07
3125,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,I had other commitments; I told you yesterday during lunch.,2024-09-03 20:57:07
3126,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_3,Other commitments? This project is due in two days!,2024-09-03 21:06:07
3127,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,We all managed to make time. What's so important that you can't?,2024-09-03 21:08:07
3128,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"I have a life outside of this group, you know.",2024-09-03 21:15:07
3129,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_3,And we don't? We're all sacrificing for the same grade!,2024-09-03 21:25:07
3130,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,It's not just about the grade. It's about respecting everyone's time.,2024-09-03 21:31:07
3131,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,Could you stop lecturing me like I'm a child?,2024-09-03 21:35:07
3132,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_3,"Maybe if you acted more responsibly, we wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 21:38:07
3133,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,And now we're behind because you couldn't spare one hour.,2024-09-03 21:43:07
3134,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's all my fault now? What about the times I did show up and carried the load?",2024-09-03 21:48:07
3135,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_3,That's a bold claim. We all contributed equally until you started slacking.,2024-09-03 21:56:07
3136,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,"This is a team effort. One person slacks, and it pulls us all down.",2024-09-03 21:57:07
3137,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"Fine, if you think I'm so useless, maybe I should just drop out of the project altogether.",2024-09-03 22:03:07
3138,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,"Don't be dramatic. We need you, but we need you to show up.",2024-09-03 22:13:07
3139,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_3,"Yeah, quitting solves nothing. We need to get this done together.",2024-09-03 22:17:07
3140,escalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,If you had a bit more understanding,2024-09-03 22:18:07
3141,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,I can't believe you let us down like this!,2024-09-03 20:52:09
3142,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,Me? You're the one who missed all your shots!,2024-09-03 20:59:09
3143,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. We need to focus on what went wrong and fix it.",2024-09-03 21:01:09
3144,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Don't act like you're not part of the problem, you missed those passes!",2024-09-03 21:05:09
3145,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't hogging the ball all the time, we would have had a chance.",2024-09-03 21:13:09
3146,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_3,"Okay, pointing fingers isn't going to solve anything. Let's talk about our strategy.",2024-09-03 21:23:09
3147,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,Strategy? You mean the one that obviously failed us today?,2024-09-03 21:28:09
3148,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,"Seriously, we need to re-evaluate our positions. Maybe you're not cut out for the lead.",2024-09-03 21:31:09
3149,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_3,"Instead of attacking each other, let's figure out what we can do better next time.",2024-09-03 21:41:09
3150,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Fine, but we need to address why certain people can’t seem to follow the game plan.",2024-09-03 21:46:09
3151,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,And certain people need to listen when we say the plan isn't working.,2024-09-03 21:50:09
3152,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_3,Can we at least agree that communication is an issue?,2024-09-03 21:59:09
3153,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Yeah, as long as people actually start listening.",2024-09-03 22:06:09
3154,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,"Agreed, but you need to stop acting like you’re the only one who knows what to do.",2024-09-03 22:11:09
3155,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_3,Let’s set a team meeting and go over everything together. We’re better than this.,2024-09-03 22:16:09
3156,escalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Fine, but no",2024-09-03 22:26:09
3157,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,Why didn’t you tell me you had messed up the budget calculations?,2024-09-03 20:55:13
3158,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,I was going to fix it before anyone noticed! Why are you making such a big deal out of it?,2024-09-03 21:02:13
3159,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,A big deal? We’re missing money for critical supplies! How is that not a big deal?,2024-09-03 21:04:13
3160,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,Because I was handling it! You never believe I can do anything right.,2024-09-03 21:14:13
3161,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"Maybe because every time I trust you, something like this happens!",2024-09-03 21:21:13
3162,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it’s all my fault? What about the time you lost that major client?",2024-09-03 21:27:13
3163,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"That was different, and you know it. How could you compare the two?",2024-09-03 21:35:13
3164,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"Not different at all. Mistakes happen, but you only blame me when things go wrong.",2024-09-03 21:44:13
3165,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"You’re twisting the facts. If you had just communicated earlier, this could have been resolved.",2024-09-03 21:48:13
3166,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"And if you had trusted me, this pressure wouldn't exist! You're always hovering over my shoulder.",2024-09-03 21:50:13
3167,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,I wouldn’t have to if you proved capable of handling your responsibilities!,2024-09-03 21:51:13
3168,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"Maybe I would, if I didn’t have to constantly clean up your messes too!",2024-09-03 21:58:13
3169,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"Oh please, my messes? You barely get anything right!",2024-09-03 22:02:13
3170,escalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,That’s exactly the attitude that creates these problems! How are we supposed to work together with you treating me like,2024-09-03 22:04:13
3171,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass the ball to me? I was wide open!,2024-09-03 20:56:16
3172,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,Because you always hog it when you get it! I didn't trust you'd make the shot.,2024-09-03 21:03:16
3173,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,That's ridiculous! I've made more shots than anyone on this team!,2024-09-03 21:07:16
3174,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,"Guys, focus on the game! We're down by ten points!",2024-09-03 21:15:16
3175,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,"Maybe if speaker_1 would stop trying to play hero, we wouldn't be!",2024-09-03 21:18:16
3176,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,"Excuse me? At least I put in the effort, unlike some people!",2024-09-03 21:21:16
3177,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,This isn't helping! We need to work together.,2024-09-03 21:22:16
3178,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,Tell that to Mr. Superstar here!,2024-09-03 21:24:16
3179,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,Maybe I'd be less of a 'superstar' if you actually contributed!,2024-09-03 21:28:16
3180,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,Enough! We either play as a team or we don't play at all.,2024-09-03 21:36:16
3181,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,"Fine, but only if speaker_1 starts sharing the ball.",2024-09-03 21:40:16
3182,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,I'll share when I know you'll do something useful with it!,2024-09-03 21:50:16
3183,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,"Alright, timeout! We're not going to win by tearing each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:58:16
3184,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,"Just admit you need us, speaker_1.",2024-09-03 22:04:16
3185,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,"I don't need to admit anything, but fine, I'll pass more.",2024-09-03 22:07:16
3186,escalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,Good. Now let's get back out there and play like a team.,2024-09-03 22:16:16
3187,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,Did you seriously take credit for the project in the meeting?,2024-09-03 20:54:19
3188,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"I did most of the work, so yes, I took credit.",2024-09-03 21:03:19
3189,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,Most of the work? Are you kidding me? We all contributed equally!,2024-09-03 21:07:19
3190,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,That's not how I remember it. I was up until 3 AM finishing the report.,2024-09-03 21:13:19
3191,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,"Maybe because you left it to the last minute! We all made significant contributions, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:22:19
3192,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. Can we just talk about this rationally?",2024-09-03 21:28:19
3193,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,Why should we when someone can't appreciate the effort I put in?,2024-09-03 21:38:19
3194,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,Effort? You barely showed up to half of the planning meetings!,2024-09-03 21:40:19
3195,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"Excuse me? I had valid reasons for missing those meetings, unlike someone who just sat quietly and nodded along.",2024-09-03 21:49:19
3196,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_3,This is getting out of hand. Let's break it down and see what everyone did.,2024-09-03 21:52:19
3197,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,Fine. I compiled all the research data and created the initial drafts.,2024-09-03 21:58:19
3198,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,And I fine-tuned those drafts and made them presentable.,2024-09-03 22:01:19
3199,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,"But without the groundwork, you'd have nothing to fine-tune!",2024-09-03 22:04:19
3200,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_3,Enough! This isn't about individual contributions. It's about how we work as a team.,2024-09-03 22:07:19
3201,escalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,Easy for you to say. You just want to smooth things over and make everyone happy.,2024-09-03 22:10:19
3202,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,"How could you lose our dog, Sarah? I trusted you!",2024-09-03 20:50:21
3203,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,"I told you, Mark, he ran off when I opened the gate. It's not my fault!",2024-09-03 20:53:21
3204,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,You were supposed to watch him! You know he always tries to escape!,2024-09-03 21:03:21
3205,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,"Well maybe if you trained him better, he wouldn't run away!",2024-09-03 21:09:21
3206,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're blaming me for your carelessness?",2024-09-03 21:15:21
3207,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,I'm not the one making this a big deal. It's just a dog!,2024-09-03 21:23:21
3208,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,Just a dog? Are you serious? He's part of our family!,2024-09-03 21:30:21
3209,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,Maybe you should spend more time with your family and less time on that dog!,2024-09-03 21:33:21
3210,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,Don't you dare bring my family into this! You're the irresponsible one here!,2024-09-03 21:40:21
3211,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,And you're being irrational! Accidents happen!,2024-09-03 21:47:21
3212,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,"This isn't just an accident, it's neglect!",2024-09-03 21:57:21
3213,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,Fine! Maybe I shouldn't have to deal with your pets at all!,2024-09-03 22:02:21
3214,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,Maybe you shouldn't! You clearly don't care about them as much as I do!,2024-09-03 22:09:21
3215,escalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,"You know what, Mark? I'm done arguing with you. Find someone else to blame!",2024-09-03 22:15:21
3216,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my project files, Sam?",2024-09-03 20:50:25
3217,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,"I didn't delete them, Alex, you probably misplaced them.",2024-09-03 20:55:25
3218,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,Misplaced them? I always save them in the same folder!,2024-09-03 21:03:25
3219,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,"Well, maybe you're not as organized as you think.",2024-09-03 21:05:25
3220,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who constantly leaves his work unfinished!,2024-09-03 21:06:25
3221,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,At least I don't go around blaming people for my own mistakes!,2024-09-03 21:08:25
3222,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. Yelling won't help us find the files.",2024-09-03 21:09:25
3223,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Jamie. You don't have a deadline looming over your head!",2024-09-03 21:17:25
3224,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_3,"We're all part of this team, Alex. We need to work together, not attack each other.",2024-09-03 21:26:25
3225,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,"Yeah, maybe if Alex spent more time working and less time pointing fingers, we'd be in a better spot.",2024-09-03 21:36:25
3226,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,"Maybe if someone actually took responsibility for once, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:44:25
3227,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_3,Enough! Accusations aren't solving anything. Let's retrace our steps to see what might have happened.,2024-09-03 21:52:25
3228,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,Fine. But I still think Sam has something to do with this.,2024-09-03 21:58:25
3229,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,And I still think you're just looking for someone to blame.,2024-09-03 22:05:25
3230,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_3,"Stop it! We need a solution, not more problems. Let's focus on finding those files.",2024-09-03 22:06:25
3231,escalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,"Alright, I'll go check the",2024-09-03 22:13:25
3232,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were applying for the same promotion?,2024-09-03 20:49:28
3233,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,Because I didn't think it was any of your business!,2024-09-03 20:55:28
3234,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,Not my business? We've been working on this project together for months.,2024-09-03 21:00:28
3235,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,"Exactly, which is why I deserve the promotion more than you do!",2024-09-03 21:04:28
3236,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,Deserve? You barely contributed to the last report!,2024-09-03 21:09:28
3237,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,That's not true and you know it. You're just jealous.,2024-09-03 21:15:28
3238,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,Jealous? You're the one who can't handle a little competition.,2024-09-03 21:23:28
3239,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,At least I'm not sabotaging someone else's chances by spreading lies.,2024-09-03 21:26:28
3240,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,Lies? I've been nothing but honest while you kept this secret. That's low.,2024-09-03 21:32:28

3243,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,Maybe I want to change things instead of having to deal with your constant superiority complex.,2024-09-03 21:40:28
3244,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,"Wow, so now it's my fault you feel insecure?",2024-09-03 21:42:28
3245,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,It's not insecurity. I'm just tired of you undermining everyone's efforts to make yourself look better.,2024-09-03 21:46:28
3246,escalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,"Maybe if you communicated more instead of keeping secrets, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 21:48:28

3249,escalatory_conversation_221,speaker_2,"I needed it for my project, and you weren't using it.",2024-09-03 21:00:31
3250,escalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,That's not the point! You should've asked me first!,2024-09-03 21:07:31
3251,escalatory_conversation_221,speaker_2,"Well, I didn't think it mattered since you leave it lying around.",2024-09-03 21:08:31

3254,escalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,Overreacting? You would lose your mind if I took your phone without permission!,2024-09-03 21:22:31
3255,escalatory_conversation_221,speaker_2,"Maybe, but I wouldn't be so dramatic about it.",2024-09-03 21:29:31
3256,escalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,This isn't about drama; it's about respect. You clearly don't get that.,2024-09-03 21:31:31

3270,escalatory_conversation_222,speaker_3,Can you two cool it? We need to figure out how to salvage this before the next meeting.,2024-09-03 21:29:34
3271,escalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,Cool it? We just lost a huge client because of this disaster!,2024-09-03 21:36:34
3272,escalatory_conversation_222,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all on me? You were the one who didn't prepare the talking points!",2024-09-03 21:44:34
3273,escalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,My talking points were fine! It was your job to make the slides match.,2024-09-03 21:46:34

3275,escalatory_conversation_222,speaker_3,Enough! Name-calling won't fix our problems. How about we divide the blame and start fixing this together?,2024-09-03 22:01:34

3279,escalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,Whatever. Let's just get this sorted before we lose another client.,2024-09-03 22:24:34
3280,escalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't deliver the project on time. Are you even taking this seriously?,2024-09-03 20:49:37

3282,escalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,Communicated clearly? I sent you an email with every single detail! You just didn't bother to read it!,2024-09-03 21:02:37

3287,escalatory_conversation_223,speaker_3,"Seriously, this constant blaming isn't productive. We need to focus on solutions.",2024-09-03 21:21:37

3290,escalatory_conversation_223,speaker_3,Can we at least agree on what still needs to be done? This fighting isn't making the project any easier.,2024-09-03 21:44:37
3291,escalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,"Fine, let's hear your grand plan then. Enlighten us.",2024-09-03 21:52:37

3293,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,I can't believe you ditched the meeting again. Do you even care about our project?,2024-09-03 20:55:40
3294,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, I had an emergency! It's not like you are doing all the work yourself.",2024-09-03 21:02:40
3295,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,"An emergency? You've had so many ""emergencies"" lately; it's hard to keep track.",2024-09-03 21:07:40
3296,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,"Maybe if you stopped micromanaging everything, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:09:40
3297,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,Micromanaging? I'm trying to keep us from failing because someone has to!,2024-09-03 21:12:40

3300,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,"And here we go, back to how everything I do is wrong. Classic you!",2024-09-03 21:23:40
3301,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,I'm not saying everything you do is wrong. Just that you're not pulling your weight here.,2024-09-03 21:25:40

3306,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,Maybe you're just pushing too hard and expecting too much from everyone.,2024-09-03 21:52:40
3307,escalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,Expecting too much,2024-09-03 21:53:40

3315,escalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,Of course you'd take his side! You two have been teaming up against me from the start!,2024-09-03 21:28:44

3319,escalatory_conversation_225,speaker_3,This is pointless. Can we focus on what needs to be done next?,2024-09-03 21:52:44
3320,escalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,"Fine, but I'm not convinced. This partnership isn't working.",2024-09-03 21:53:44
3321,escalatory_conversation_225,speaker_2,Maybe it’s because you’re too stubborn to try!,2024-09-03 21:59:44
3322,escalatory_conversation_225,speaker_3,"Come on, let's just list what we need to finish. We’re all stressed.",2024-09-03 22:02:44
3323,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted our project without consulting me first!,2024-09-03 20:57:46
3324,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,"I had to; the deadline was approaching, and you were nowhere to be found.",2024-09-03 21:03:46
3325,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,Nowhere to be found? I was working on the final touches that you completely ignored!,2024-09-03 21:09:46
3326,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,Final touches? You mean adding unnecessary details that didn't even align with the original plan?,2024-09-03 21:16:46
3327,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,"Unnecessary? Those details were crucial, and you just discarded them like they were nothing!",2024-09-03 21:25:46
3328,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,Crucial to whom? The project was already good to go. You always make things more complicated than they need to be.,2024-09-03 21:28:46
3329,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,Complicated? I'm trying to add value while you're rushing to finish and sacrificing quality.,2024-09-03 21:31:46
3330,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,"Quality? What quality? Your so-called ""touches"" have delayed us before. We can't afford that anymore.",2024-09-03 21:38:46
3331,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,Delayed us? Who's the one who procrastinated half the time and left everything to the last minute?,2024-09-03 21:43:46
3332,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,"So now it's all my fault? Maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:50:46
3333,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,"Communicated better? I've been sending you updates daily, which you clearly never read!",2024-09-03 21:55:46
3334,escalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,Updates? More like essays. How am I supposed to sift through all that while juggling everything else?,2024-09-03 21:59:46

3339,escalatory_conversation_227,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. Jen, why didn't you just tell us you couldn't make it?",2024-09-03 20:58:50
3340,escalatory_conversation_227,speaker_1,"Yeah, communication would be nice. It's like you're never fully committed.",2024-09-03 21:06:50

3346,escalatory_conversation_227,speaker_3,Can we focus on getting this done instead of pointing fingers?,2024-09-03 21:42:50
3347,escalatory_conversation_227,speaker_1,We can't get anything done if people keep skipping rehearsals.,2024-09-03 21:52:50
3348,escalatory_conversation_227,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe you should get off your high horse and realize that everyone has their own issues to deal with.,2024-09-03 21:56:50
3349,escalatory_conversation_227,speaker_1,And maybe you should stop making excuses and show some dedication for once.,2024-09-03 22:05:50
3350,escalatory_conversation_227,speaker_3,We’re not getting anywhere like this. Can we please find a solution that works for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:07:50
3351,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,Why didn't you submit the team project on time yesterday?,2024-09-03 20:58:53
3352,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,I was busy with other assignments. Why didn't you remind me?,2024-09-03 21:00:53

3355,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,My part? I finished my section three days ago! Stop making excuses.,2024-09-03 21:19:53
3356,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_3,Can both of you stop for a second? We're all responsible for this mess.,2024-09-03 21:26:53
3357,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're blaming me too?",2024-09-03 21:32:53
3358,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_3,I'm not blaming anyone. I'm saying we should have communicated better.,2024-09-03 21:41:53
3359,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,Communicated better? I've been trying to reach both of you all week!,2024-09-03 21:49:53
3360,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,Really? I didn't see any messages from you.,2024-09-03 21:58:53
3361,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,Maybe because you never check your notifications!,2024-09-03 22:04:53
3362,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_3,Enough! Pointing fingers won't solve anything. What are we going to do now?,2024-09-03 22:13:53
3363,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,We wouldn't be in this situation if someone hadn't procrastinated.,2024-09-03 22:20:53
3364,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,"Fine, it's all my fault. Are you happy now?",2024-09-03 22:27:53
3365,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_3,"Seriously, stop it. We have to find a way to make up for the lost grade.",2024-09-03 22:31:53
3366,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,Apologizing would be a good start.,2024-09-03 22:40:53
3367,escalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,Apologizing won't change anything now. We need a real plan.,2024-09-03 22:47:53

3369,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,Mess up? I told you it was outdated. We needed the new stats.,2024-09-03 20:56:56
3370,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,You didn't even ask the team before changing everything!,2024-09-03 21:02:56
3371,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,Because I'd still be waiting for a response! No one ever replies.,2024-09-03 21:10:56
3372,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,"Calm down, both of you. We need to fix this together.",2024-09-03 21:18:56
3373,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you weren't double-booked trying to make sense of it all.",2024-09-03 21:23:56
3374,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,"Maybe if everything wasn't so last-minute, this wouldn't have happened.",2024-09-03 21:25:56

3377,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,Pointing fingers isn’t helping. Can we just focus on correcting the slides?,2024-09-03 21:46:56
3378,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,"Sure, if people actually listen and respond this time.",2024-09-03 21:51:56
3379,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,"Here we go again, Alex acting like the martyr.",2024-09-03 21:57:56
3380,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,Maybe because I’m the one who ends up fixing everyone's mistakes!,2024-09-03 22:02:56
3381,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,"Oh, so now we’re all incompetent, right?",2024-09-03 22:06:56
3382,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,"Enough! We need solutions, not more problems.",2024-09-03 22:14:56
3383,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,"Fine, let’s just fix it, but this better not happen again.",2024-09-03 22:24:56
3384,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,"Agreed, but we need better communication from everyone.",2024-09-03 22:30:56
3385,escalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,So how about we,2024-09-03 22:39:56
3386,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,I can't believe you just stood there and watched while the project crashed and burned!,2024-09-03 20:55:59
3387,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's entirely my fault, is it?",2024-09-03 20:58:59
3388,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,You were supposed to be handling the presentation! You didn't even bother to check if the video was working!,2024-09-03 20:59:59
3389,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,Maybe I would've noticed if you hadn't taken forever to finish your part of the report!,2024-09-03 21:05:59
3390,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,My part? I stayed up all night finishing that just because you couldn't be bothered to help with the analysis!,2024-09-03 21:08:59
3391,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,"Don't act like you did any favors. Your analysis was full of errors, and I had to fix them all!",2024-09-03 21:13:59
3392,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,"If you stopped pointing fingers for a second, we could actually make this work!",2024-09-03 21:20:59
3393,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,"And if you stopped acting like you're the only one doing anything, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:23:59
3394,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,We won't fix anything by yelling at each other. Can we at least agree on that?,2024-09-03 21:30:59
3395,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,"Fine, but we need to figure out how to work together instead of tearing each other down.",2024-09-03 21:32:59
3396,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's start by splitting the responsibilities more clearly next time.,2024-09-03 21:33:59
3397,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,And keeping better track of deadlines. No more last-minute disasters.,2024-09-03 21:42:59
3398,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,Deal. And double-checking each other's work before presenting anything.,2024-09-03 21:43:59
3399,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan. Let's try to make sure this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 21:50:59
3400,escalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,,2024-09-03 22:00:59
3401,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,I can't believe you just took my design without asking!,2024-09-03 20:51:03
3402,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"Your design? I improved it, made it actually usable.",2024-09-03 20:56:03
3403,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,Usable? You destroyed my concept and turned it into something completely different!,2024-09-03 21:01:03
3404,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. It was a mess to begin with. You should be thanking me.",2024-09-03 21:09:03
3405,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,"Thanking you? For what, exactly? Stealing my work and ruining it?",2024-09-03 21:10:03
3406,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,It's called collaboration! Maybe you could learn something if you stopped being so territorial.,2024-09-03 21:14:03
3407,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,"Taking someone's idea and changing everything isn't collaboration, it's hijacking!",2024-09-03 21:18:03
3408,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"If you were better at your job, I wouldn't have had to step in.",2024-09-03 21:22:03
3409,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,"Better at my job? I've been at this for years, you've been here for months!",2024-09-03 21:23:03
3410,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"Yeah, and in those months, I've done more than you have in years.",2024-09-03 21:25:03
3411,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,That's ridiculous! My designs have always been the backbone of this team!,2024-09-03 21:27:03
3412,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"Backbone? They're outdated and inefficient! The team needs innovation, not ancient history.",2024-09-03 21:35:03
3413,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,Innovation doesn't mean tearing everything apart and ignoring other people's input!,2024-09-03 21:45:03
3414,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"If your input was any good, I wouldn't have to ignore it!",2024-09-03 21:52:03
3415,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,This is exactly why no one on the team respects you. You're impossible!,2024-09-03 22:01:03
3416,escalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,Respect? Is that what you call this? If this is,2024-09-03 22:06:03
3417,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,Why do I always have to be the one to clean up after our group meetings?,2024-09-03 20:55:06
3418,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,Maybe because you're the one always making the biggest mess.,2024-09-03 21:03:06
3419,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,"Oh come on, it’s not like cleaning up once in a while is such a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:05:06
3420,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,"That's easy for you to say, you never stick around to help.",2024-09-03 21:09:06
3421,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,That's because I have other commitments too. Not my fault you don’t plan better.,2024-09-03 21:15:06
3422,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,And what about me? I contribute just as much if not more than anyone else here.,2024-09-03 21:25:06
3423,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,"Contributing? You barely show up on time, let alone contribute.",2024-09-03 21:31:06
3424,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,At least I show up. Some of us are practically ghosts during these meetings.,2024-09-03 21:37:06
3425,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,"If anyone's a ghost, it's you. You disappear halfway through every time.",2024-09-03 21:46:06
3426,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,"Alright, enough. We need to sort out these responsibilities properly.",2024-09-03 21:52:06
3427,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,"Fine, but let’s not pretend you’re a martyr here. We all have had to pick up slack.",2024-09-03 22:01:06
3428,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,Oh really? When’s the last time you actually cleaned up anything?,2024-09-03 22:03:06
3429,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,"Last week, while you were busy chatting away.",2024-09-03 22:13:06
3430,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,Can we just divide up the tasks fairly without all this drama?,2024-09-03 22:15:06
3431,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,"Sure, if you actually stick to them this time.",2024-09-03 22:17:06
3432,escalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,Same goes for you. No more excuses.,2024-09-03 22:27:06
3433,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,"You seriously think it's okay to ditch our band practice just because you had a ""rough day""?",2024-09-03 20:59:09
3434,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! You know I've been swamped with work! I needed a break.",2024-09-03 21:04:09
3435,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,Everyone's busy! That's no excuse. We all made commitments to this band.,2024-09-03 21:08:09
3436,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,It's just one practice. Why are you blowing this out of proportion?,2024-09-03 21:09:09
3437,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,Because it's not just one! You've missed three in a row now.,2024-09-03 21:10:09
3438,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_3,"Hey, hey, can we calm down? This isn't helping anything.",2024-09-03 21:11:09
3439,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,"No, we can't! This is exactly why we keep falling apart!",2024-09-03 21:12:09
3440,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,"You're acting like I'm the only one with conflicts! What about speaker_4? He missed practice last week, and no one yelled at him!",2024-09-03 21:16:09
3441,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_3,"We're all frustrated, but fighting won't solve it. Let's talk this out.",2024-09-03 21:20:09
3442,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,Talk? We’ve tried talking. Nothing changes!,2024-09-03 21:28:09
3443,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,Maybe because you’re too busy blaming everyone else to listen.,2024-09-03 21:33:09
3444,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_3,This isn't constructive! We're a band; we need to work together.,2024-09-03 21:38:09
3445,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_4,"Alright, what's going on? Why's everyone yelling?",2024-09-03 21:41:09
3446,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,You want to know? Speaker_2 thinks it's okay to skip practices whenever he feels like it.,2024-09-03 21:49:09
3447,escalatory_conversation_233,speaker_4,I had a family emergency last week. What's speaker_2's excuse?,2024-09-03 21:56:09
3448,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,Why did you have to go and change the project proposal without telling anyone?,2024-09-03 20:51:12
3449,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,I didn't think I needed anyone's approval since no one was coming up with any good ideas.,2024-09-03 21:00:12
3450,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,"That's not the point! We agreed to work as a team, and you just went rogue.",2024-09-03 21:06:12
3451,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_3,I have to agree with speaker_1 on this. We should've at least discussed it together.,2024-09-03 21:14:12
3452,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. Every time we try to discuss something, nothing gets done. I was just trying to move us forward.",2024-09-03 21:18:12
3453,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,By undermining everyone's effort? Thanks a lot.,2024-09-03 21:22:12
3454,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_3,You can't just decide for everyone. It's not fair to the rest of us who have been contributing.,2024-09-03 21:30:12
3455,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,Contributing what exactly? A bunch of dead-end ideas and endless debates?,2024-09-03 21:36:12
3456,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it. We were getting somewhere until you decided to play dictator.",2024-09-03 21:44:12
3457,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_3,"We had disagreements, sure, but they were part of the process. Now you've just blown it up.",2024-09-03 21:46:12
3458,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,"If any of you had better suggestions, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place!",2024-09-03 21:53:12
3459,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,Stop acting like you're the only one who cares about this project.,2024-09-03 21:58:12
3460,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_3,And like you're the only one who can fix it. We are supposed to be equals here.,2024-09-03 22:00:12
3461,escalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to take charge,",2024-09-03 22:04:12
3462,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,Why did you take the key to the supply closet without asking?,2024-09-03 20:50:15
3463,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,I thought it was open for anyone who needed it.,2024-09-03 20:55:15
3464,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,"Well, it's not! You've messed up the entire inventory, again.",2024-09-03 21:02:15
3465,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. I just needed some extra paint for my mural. It's not a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:05:15
3466,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,It is a big deal when I have to spend hours rechecking everything because you can't follow simple rules.,2024-09-03 21:15:15
3467,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were better organized, it wouldn't be such a mess to begin with.",2024-09-03 21:21:15
3468,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,Seriously? You're blaming me for your lack of respect for shared resources?,2024-09-03 21:22:15
3469,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,Respect? What about your lack of support for the art club? We're creating something for the school!,2024-09-03 21:30:15
3470,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,"And I'm in charge of ensuring there's enough supplies for everyone, not just your precious art club.",2024-09-03 21:36:15
3471,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,"Maybe if you cared about the actual needs of the students, you'd understand why taking the paint was necessary.",2024-09-03 21:46:15
3472,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,"Maybe if you followed the procedures, we wouldn't have this problem. You always act like the rules don't apply to you.",2024-09-03 21:55:15
3473,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,And you act like a little authoritarian. Lighten up for once!,2024-09-03 21:59:15
3474,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,"Rules exist for a reason. This isn't about control, it's about fairness.",2024-09-03 22:03:15
3475,escalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,Fairness? Like when you waste half the budget on useless projects for your science lab?,2024-09-03 22:07:15
3476,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,I can't believe you took my idea and presented it to the boss as your own!,2024-09-03 20:51:18
3477,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,Are you serious? That idea wasn’t solely yours. We brainstormed it together.,2024-09-03 20:54:18
3478,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,Brainstormed? You barely contributed! I did most of the work!,2024-09-03 21:04:18
3479,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,That’s not true. I added crucial points that made the idea solid.,2024-09-03 21:10:18
3480,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,Crucial points? Like what? Name one thing you did that made a difference.,2024-09-03 21:14:18
3481,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,I’m not going to list everything I did. You know it was a team effort.,2024-09-03 21:15:18
3482,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,A team effort? Then why did you act like you came up with everything alone?,2024-09-03 21:23:18
3483,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,"Look, I saw an opportunity to present and I took it. We both benefit if our idea gets implemented.",2024-09-03 21:28:18
3484,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,But it's not about the team benefiting; it's about you taking all the credit!,2024-09-03 21:36:18
3485,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,I didn't take all the credit. I mentioned that we worked on it together.,2024-09-03 21:45:18
3486,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,The boss didn’t seem to hear that. He congratulated you like it was your brainchild.,2024-09-03 21:53:18
3487,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,"Well, maybe because I explained it effectively. You could have spoken up too.",2024-09-03 22:02:18
3488,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,Spoken up? You didn’t give me a chance! I felt completely blindsided.,2024-09-03 22:05:18
3489,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,So why didn’t you say something during the meeting instead of attacking me now?,2024-09-03 22:08:18
3490,escalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,Because,2024-09-03 22:10:18
3491,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,"Why did you use my design without even asking me, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:52:21
3492,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"Because your design was sitting there unused, Sarah. What was I supposed to do, let it go to waste?",2024-09-03 21:00:21
3493,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,It's my work! You can't just take it and claim it as yours!,2024-09-03 21:07:21
3494,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,I didn't claim it as mine! I just used it because we needed something fast for the presentation.,2024-09-03 21:11:21
3495,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,That's not the point! You didn't consider my consent at all.,2024-09-03 21:17:21
3496,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"Oh please, like you’ve never borrowed any of my ideas before.",2024-09-03 21:27:21
3497,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,That's completely different and you know it. I always give you credit.,2024-09-03 21:35:21
3498,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"So you want credit now? Fine, I'll mention your name next time. Happy?",2024-09-03 21:42:21
3499,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,"It's not just about the credit, it's about respect and acknowledging my hard work.",2024-09-03 21:43:21
3500,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"You’re overreacting. We had a deadline, and your design saved us. You should be thanking me.",2024-09-03 21:46:21
3501,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,Thanking you? For stealing my work without my permission? That's not how teamwork works.,2024-09-03 21:55:21
3502,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were around more often, I wouldn't have had to make that call.",2024-09-03 22:00:21
3503,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,Now you’re blaming me for being busy? Unbelievable.,2024-09-03 22:05:21
3504,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"Well, if you actually cared about the project, you wouldn't be so busy.",2024-09-03 22:08:21
3505,escalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,"And if you respected your team,",2024-09-03 22:15:21
3506,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were quitting the band?,2024-09-03 20:58:23
3507,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,"I didn't think it mattered to you, honestly.",2024-09-03 21:06:23
3508,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,Of course it matters! We've been playing together for three years!,2024-09-03 21:11:23
3509,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,"Well, it didn't seem like you cared lately. You barely show up for practice.",2024-09-03 21:12:23
3510,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,That's because you've been taking over everything! It's not even fun anymore.,2024-09-03 21:22:23
3511,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,Taking over? Someone had to keep this band together while you flaked out!,2024-09-03 21:30:23
3512,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"Maybe if you weren't so controlling, I wouldn't have to ""flake out"" as you put it.",2024-09-03 21:35:23
3513,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,Controlling? I'm just trying to make sure we sound good!,2024-09-03 21:45:23
3514,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"Yeah, by making it all about you. We can't even suggest anything without you shooting it down.",2024-09-03 21:55:23
3515,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,Maybe your suggestions aren't that great. Did you think about that?,2024-09-03 22:04:23
3516,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"Wow, talk about being a team player. No wonder everyone else is losing interest.",2024-09-03 22:09:23
3517,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,Everyone else? Sounds like you're just making excuses for your own laziness.,2024-09-03 22:16:23
3518,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"There you go again, dismissing everyone else's views. This isn't just about me!",2024-09-03 22:17:23
3519,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,"Fine, what do you want then? To just show up and mess around?",2024-09-03 22:23:23
3520,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"I want to actually collaborate, not be dictated to.",2024-09-03 22:25:23
3521,escalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,Maybe if you put in as much effort as you do in complaining,2024-09-03 22:32:23

3524,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,That's totally unfair! I did all the research while you sat around doing nothing.,2024-09-03 21:08:26
3525,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_2,Research? You call browsing random websites research? Get real!,2024-09-03 21:13:26
3526,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_3,Can you both stop blaming each other? We need to figure out how to fix this mess.,2024-09-03 21:14:26
3527,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,Easy for you to say when you're not the one getting blamed.,2024-09-03 21:22:26

3531,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_2,My part? At least I didn't spend the whole time complaining like you!,2024-09-03 21:46:26
3532,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_3,Enough! This isn't helping. What do we need to finish by tomorrow?,2024-09-03 21:49:26

3535,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_3,"Seriously, if we can’t focus and divide this up, we’re done for.",2024-09-03 22:02:26
3536,escalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,"Fine, I’ll do the conclusion if that'll shut you up.",2024-09-03 22:05:26
3537,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,Why haven't you finished the report yet? We’re on a strict deadline!,2024-09-03 20:52:30

3539,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,Extra tasks? Those were assigned to you because you promised you’d handle them!,2024-09-03 21:09:30
3540,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,"Promised? I remember you saying it’s a team effort, not me volunteering to do everything!",2024-09-03 21:18:30
3541,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,A team effort doesn’t mean you get to slack off and blame everyone else!,2024-09-03 21:28:30
3542,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,Slack off? I’ve been working overtime while you sit around giving orders!,2024-09-03 21:29:30
3543,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,Giving orders? I’m keeping this project from falling apart because you can’t manage your workload!,2024-09-03 21:39:30
3544,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,"Maybe if you helped instead of criticizing, we’d actually make some progress!",2024-09-03 21:48:30

3549,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,Arrogant? At least I'm not making excuses for my failures all the time!,2024-09-03 22:16:30
3550,escalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,"Excuses? Fine, if you think you’re so",2024-09-03 22:19:30

3553,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,And you can't reschedule a doctor's appointment but can skip an important team meeting? Seriously?,2024-09-03 21:14:33
3554,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_2,Do you think I want to miss the meeting? I don't exactly enjoy having to go to the doctor.,2024-09-03 21:24:33
3555,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus? We're behind on the project because of all these delays.",2024-09-03 21:31:33
3556,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,"Exactly, and Sarah keeps adding to those delays by not showing up.",2024-09-03 21:40:33
3557,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_2,You're making it seem like I'm the only one at fault here. What about Kevin missing his deadlines?,2024-09-03 21:41:33
3558,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_4,"Hey, don't drag me into this. I've been dealing with the technical issues you should have fixed weeks ago.",2024-09-03 21:45:33
3559,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,See? This is exactly why nothing's getting done. Everyone's passing the blame around instead of taking responsibility.,2024-09-03 21:48:33

3561,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,Micromanaging? I'm trying to keep this sinking ship afloat while you're off doing who knows what!,2024-09-03 22:04:33
3562,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_3,This is getting out of hand. We're not getting anywhere like this.,2024-09-03 22:06:33
3563,escalatory_conversation_241,speaker_4,"Yeah, well, we wouldn't be in crisis mode if everyone just did their job properly.",2024-09-03 22:11:33

3565,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,I can't believe you made that call without consulting me!,2024-09-03 20:51:37
3566,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,I didn't think I needed to ask you for every single decision!,2024-09-03 21:01:37

3569,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're blaming me for your lack of communication?",2024-09-03 21:11:37
3570,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,It's not just about communication; it's about responsibility. I seem to be the only one taking any!,2024-09-03 21:19:37
3571,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who missed the last three project deadlines.,2024-09-03 21:27:37
3572,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,Those deadlines would have been met if you'd done your part instead of vanishing for days!,2024-09-03 21:28:37
3573,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,I was handling client meetings you couldn't be bothered to attend. Maybe you should thank me instead!,2024-09-03 21:35:37
3574,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,"Client meetings? Is that what you call hanging out with friends and calling it ""networking""?",2024-09-03 21:42:37
3575,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,How dare you undermine my efforts? You're the one who leaves everything to the last minute!,2024-09-03 21:45:37
3576,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were clear on the strategy instead of vague promises, we'd be more efficient!",2024-09-03 21:52:37
3577,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,My strategies are clear; you're just too stubborn to follow them!,2024-09-03 21:55:37
3578,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,Clear? You change your mind every two seconds!,2024-09-03 21:56:37
3579,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,At least I adapt to new information. You stick to outdated plans!,2024-09-03 22:00:37
3580,escalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,Outdated,2024-09-03 22:06:37
3581,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,"Why did you swap the ingredients without telling anyone, Emily?",2024-09-03 20:57:40
3582,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,"I thought using organic ingredients would be better for the bake sale, Karen.",2024-09-03 21:07:40
3583,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,Better? We were supposed to follow the recipe we agreed on!,2024-09-03 21:13:40
3584,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,"Well, I didn’t see why it had to be set in stone if we can improve it.",2024-09-03 21:17:40
3585,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_3,"Guys, the customers complained about the taste. This is a disaster for our club.",2024-09-03 21:23:40
3586,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,Maybe they just don’t appreciate quality when they taste it.,2024-09-03 21:25:40
3587,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,Or maybe you just sabotaged our work without considering the consequences!,2024-09-03 21:26:40
3588,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,"Oh, please. You act like it’s the end of the world. It was just some brownies!",2024-09-03 21:31:40
3589,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,Just some brownies? This was a fundraiser! Now our club's reputation is ruined!,2024-09-03 21:41:40
3590,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_3,I have to agree with Karen. This wasn’t some personal experiment.,2024-09-03 21:45:40
3591,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,"Fine, so next time you can bake everything yourselves. Happy now?",2024-09-03 21:49:40

3596,escalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,Whatever. This whole club didn’t even care about my contributions anyway,2024-09-03 22:23:40

3603,escalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,"Really, Claire? You’re taking her side too? I had a more critical priority to handle today!",2024-09-03 21:19:43
3604,escalatory_conversation_244,speaker_3,We all made sacrifices for this project. You promised you’d be there.,2024-09-03 21:23:43
3605,escalatory_conversation_244,speaker_1,And not showing up makes us look bad in front of the entire department!,2024-09-03 21:32:43
3606,escalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,Look bad? It’s not like you guys nailed it without me!,2024-09-03 21:41:43

3608,escalatory_conversation_244,speaker_1,Exactly. It wasn’t just about the presentation; it was about showing we can work together.,2024-09-03 21:57:43
3609,escalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,Funny how you want to talk about teamwork now but left me to handle client issues alone.,2024-09-03 22:02:43

3611,escalatory_conversation_245,speaker_1,Why did you have to lie to everyone about the game's strategy? We were all prepared for a completely different plan!,2024-09-03 20:57:46
3612,escalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,"What do you mean ""lie""? I didn't lie! I just made a last-minute decision. It’s called being flexible!",2024-09-03 21:00:46
3613,escalatory_conversation_245,speaker_3,Flexible? Are you serious? You didn't even tell any of us! How are we supposed to trust you when you change things without warning?,2024-09-03 21:03:46
3614,escalatory_conversation_245,speaker_1,"Exactly. You completely threw us off. No wonder we lost, we weren't on the same page!",2024-09-03 21:12:46
3615,escalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,"Maybe if you guys were good enough, you could adapt on the fly instead of whining about it!",2024-09-03 21:13:46
3616,escalatory_conversation_245,speaker_4,"Wow, nice. Blame us for your poor leadership. Classic.",2024-09-03 21:18:46

3626,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,I'm doing my part. Maybe you should focus on your own work instead of criticizing me all the time.,2024-09-03 21:06:49
3627,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,Focusing on my work? I've been doing double the effort because you keep slacking off!,2024-09-03 21:11:49
3628,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,"Double the effort? Don't exaggerate. Besides, the workload distribution was supposed to be balanced, not me doing everything according to your schedule.",2024-09-03 21:13:49
3629,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,"Your schedule has been ridiculous. Everyone else manages to be there, why can't you?",2024-09-03 21:18:49
3630,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,"Because I have other responsibilities, unlike you who seems to live for this project only.",2024-09-03 21:25:49

3634,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,Maybe because you're not looking in the right places. I uploaded everything to the shared folder.,2024-09-03 21:49:49
3635,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,"The shared folder you never mentioned? Great communication, as usual.",2024-09-03 21:57:49
3636,escalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,You never asked.,2024-09-03 22:05:49
3637,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,Why did you touch my project without asking?,2024-09-03 20:56:53
3638,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,I was just trying to help! Your layout was all over the place.,2024-09-03 20:59:53
3639,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,That’s not your call to make! I had a specific plan!,2024-09-03 21:03:53

3642,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,Messed up? I improved it! You should be thanking me.,2024-09-03 21:27:53
3643,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,Thanking you? You ruined weeks of work in one snap decision!,2024-09-03 21:35:53

3649,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,That’s the point! You didn’t know! So why mess with it?,2024-09-03 22:12:53
3650,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,Because I could see you struggling and I stepped in to help!,2024-09-03 22:21:53
3651,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,Help? More like sabotage. You made it worse!,2024-09-03 22:25:53
3652,escalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,I can’t believe you’re being so ungrateful. Do you think I went out of my way,2024-09-03 22:28:53

3655,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,"Well, today you definitely messed up. We're short on three major items. How do you explain that?",2024-09-03 21:06:56
3656,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't keep changing the order schedules every week, I wouldn't be so confused!",2024-09-03 21:14:56
3657,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,"I'm only changing them because of the sales data, which you clearly can't keep up with!",2024-09-03 21:23:56

3662,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_3,I know enough to see that finger-pointing isn't going to fix anything.,2024-09-03 21:40:56
3663,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,"Maybe if Jason would own up to his mistakes for once, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",2024-09-03 21:42:56
3664,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,"And maybe if you stopped micromanaging everyone, we could do our jobs properly!",2024-09-03 21:45:56
3665,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,"Micromanaging? It's called doing my job, something you clearly need help with!",2024-09-03 21:49:56
3666,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,"Oh, that's rich coming from someone who couldn't even complete a simple stock report last month.",2024-09-03 21:51:56
3667,escalatory_conversation_248,speaker_3,This isn't getting us anywhere,2024-09-03 21:57:56
3668,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the group project without even consulting us first!,2024-09-03 20:56:59
3669,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"What choice did I have? You guys were dragging your feet, and the deadline was looming.",2024-09-03 21:02:59
3670,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_3,"That doesn't give you the right to make decisions for the entire group, speaker_2. We all had parts to finalize.",2024-09-03 21:08:59
3671,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"If we waited for everyone, we'd never get anything done. Someone had to take charge.",2024-09-03 21:10:59
3672,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_4,"Taking charge doesn't mean ignoring our input, speaker_2. We all have the right to contribute.",2024-09-03 21:19:59
3673,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"Oh, please, speaker_4! You barely did anything. You’d rather talk than take action.",2024-09-03 21:21:59
3674,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,"That’s not fair, speaker_2. We each had specific roles. Yours wasn’t more important than ours.",2024-09-03 21:30:59
3675,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,Then why didn’t you all pull your weight? It felt like I was doing everything.,2024-09-03 21:40:59
3676,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_3,We did our parts. You just didn’t bother to check in with us!,2024-09-03 21:46:59
3677,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_4,Exactly. We wanted this to be a collaborative effort. What’s the point if you steamroll over us?,2024-09-03 21:52:59
3678,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"Maybe if you all worked faster, I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 21:58:59
3679,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,That’s ridiculous. Fast doesn’t mean better. We needed time to refine our sections.,2024-09-03 22:01:59
3680,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_3,"And now if there are any mistakes, they’re on you since you didn’t wait.",2024-09-03 22:03:59
3681,escalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:06:59
3682,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,I can't believe you took all the credit for the project. We were supposed to share it equally!,2024-09-03 20:54:02
3683,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break! I did most of the work anyway. You barely did anything.",2024-09-03 21:00:02
3684,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,"That’s not true! I stayed up all night working on the presentation slides, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:01:02
3685,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,Slides? That’s not even the hard part! I did all the research and data analysis!,2024-09-03 21:05:02
3686,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,You wouldn’t have any data to analyze if I hadn’t coordinated with the client for their requirements.,2024-09-03 21:08:02
3687,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,"Coordination? Don’t make me laugh. You sent a few emails, big deal.",2024-09-03 21:16:02
3688,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,At least I communicated. You kept everything to yourself and didn’t involve me in any decisions.,2024-09-03 21:23:02
3689,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,Maybe because you’re unreliable. Remember when you missed that crucial meeting?,2024-09-03 21:28:02
3690,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,I had a family emergency! And I told you about it in advance!,2024-09-03 21:30:02
3691,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,"Excuses, excuses. Just admit it, you’re not committed to this team.",2024-09-03 21:39:02
3692,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,Don’t lecture me about commitment when you hijack the project just to make yourself look good.,2024-09-03 21:45:02
3693,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,"If you're so upset, why didn't you bring it up sooner? Oh right, because you can't handle confrontation.",2024-09-03 21:47:02
3694,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,Maybe I didn’t because I thought we were friends who could trust each other!,2024-09-03 21:57:02
3695,escalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,Friends? Friends don’t,2024-09-03 22:06:02
3696,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,"You know, I can't believe you actually went through my phone without asking.",2024-09-03 20:51:05
3697,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,"You left it on the table, wide open. What did you expect me to do, just ignore it?",2024-09-03 20:53:05
3698,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,"Yes, I expected you to respect my privacy. How could you invade my space like that?",2024-09-03 20:59:05
3699,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,"Because I've been suspicious for weeks! Every time I ask you where you’re going or what you’re doing, you get all defensive.",2024-09-03 21:09:05
3700,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,Defensive? Maybe because you’re constantly prying into my life. What's your problem?,2024-09-03 21:14:05
3701,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,"My problem? How about the fact that you’re keeping secrets. If everything was fine, you wouldn’t act so shady.",2024-09-03 21:20:05
3702,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,"Oh, so now I’m shady? Maybe I just didn’t want to share every single detail of my life with everyone.",2024-09-03 21:26:05
3703,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,Everyone? We’ve been best friends for years. Friends don’t hide things from each other!,2024-09-03 21:29:05
3704,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,"Sometimes, friends need space too. Just because we’re close doesn’t mean you have rights over my personal stuff!",2024-09-03 21:38:05
3705,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,"This isn't just about personal stuff. It's about trust. Or lack of it, apparently.",2024-09-03 21:45:05
3706,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,"Trust goes both ways. If you trusted me, you wouldn’t need to snoop around like a detective.",2024-09-03 21:55:05
3707,escalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more open, I wouldn’t have to. What are you hiding, anyway?",2024-09-03 21:59:05
3708,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't finish the project on time.,2024-09-03 21:00:09
3709,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,I was waiting for your part! You didn't send me anything until last night.,2024-09-03 21:10:09
3710,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,That's because I was busy fixing the mistakes in your section!,2024-09-03 21:17:09
3711,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,Mistakes? My section was perfectly fine. You're just making excuses for your poor time management.,2024-09-03 21:20:09
3712,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_3,Both of you need to stop blaming each other. We all dropped the ball.,2024-09-03 21:25:09
3713,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,"Don't drag us all into this mess. If you actually did your job, we wouldn't be arguing right now.",2024-09-03 21:31:09
3714,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,"You're one to talk, speaker_1. You're always late with your parts and never communicate.",2024-09-03 21:33:09
3715,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_3,"Fighting isn't going to solve anything, we need to figure out how to fix this.",2024-09-03 21:37:09
3716,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,"Fix this? There's no fixing it now, we're already behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:42:09
3717,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,This is exactly why I hate working with you. You're impossible to talk to.,2024-09-03 21:47:09
3718,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_3,"If we don't do something soon, the project will fail. Can we please focus on finding a solution?",2024-09-03 21:52:09
3719,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,"Fine, but I still think speaker_2 should take responsibility for this mess.",2024-09-03 21:57:09
3720,escalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,"Whatever, let's just split the remaining tasks and get it done. But next time, I’m not working with either of you.",2024-09-03 22:01:09
3721,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were going to quit the band, Mark?",2024-09-03 20:56:12
3722,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"Because I knew you'd try to talk me out of it, Sarah. It's my decision, not yours.",2024-09-03 20:57:12
3723,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,We all depend on you! You can't just walk away without saying anything.,2024-09-03 21:05:12
3724,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"Well, I'm tired of carrying all the weight. You all never practice enough, and it's always me putting in the extra work.",2024-09-03 21:06:12
3725,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_3,"That's not fair, Mark. We've all been putting in effort. Just because you're the lead guitarist doesn't mean you're the only one that matters.",2024-09-03 21:09:12
3726,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"Oh really, Jen? When was the last time you all showed up on time for practice, huh?",2024-09-03 21:14:12
3727,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_4,"Come on, guys. Fighting isn't going to solve anything. Mark, can we at least discuss this rationally?",2024-09-03 21:18:12
3728,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"Discuss what, Mike? I'm out. There's nothing to discuss.",2024-09-03 21:22:12
3729,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,Don't be like this. Remember why we started this band in the first place? We dreamed of making it big together!,2024-09-03 21:27:12
3730,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"Dreams change, Sarah. I've had enough of the nonsense and the half-hearted efforts.",2024-09-03 21:32:12
3731,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_3,"You're acting like we're not committed, Mark. We've all sacrificed a lot for this.",2024-09-03 21:41:12
3732,escalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,Sacrificed? You've got to be kidding me. I'm the one who's been missing family events and working late nights just to keep this band afloat.,2024-09-03 21:50:12
3733,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,"I can't believe you copied my entire design for the project, Lisa!",2024-09-03 20:57:15
3734,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Mark? I only took inspiration from it.",2024-09-03 20:59:15
3735,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,Inspiration? You didn't even change the main elements! It's obvious you just stole my work.,2024-09-03 21:05:15
3736,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"Oh, please. It's not like your design was so groundbreaking. I made it better anyway.",2024-09-03 21:15:15
3737,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,Better? You just slapped on a different color and called it your own!,2024-09-03 21:23:15
3738,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so lazy, you would have come up with something more original yourself.",2024-09-03 21:32:15
3739,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,"Lazy? I spent weeks working on that design, unlike you who just took the easy way out.",2024-09-03 21:41:15
3740,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"Well, too bad. It's not my fault your creativity has hit a dead end.",2024-09-03 21:51:15
3741,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,"This isn't about creativity, it's about integrity! You can't just take credit for someone else's hard work.",2024-09-03 22:01:15
3742,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"Integrity? Spare me. In the real world, the only thing that matters is the result.",2024-09-03 22:11:15
3743,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,"If you think stealing is the way to get results, then you're delusional.",2024-09-03 22:14:15
3744,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"And if you think whining about it will change anything, you're wasting your breath.",2024-09-03 22:23:15
3745,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,"This isn't over, Lisa. I'll make sure everyone knows what you did.",2024-09-03 22:31:15
3746,escalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"Go ahead, Mark. Cry all you want. It's not going to change the fact that my design is",2024-09-03 22:39:15
3747,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted your version of the project without even discussing it with me.,2024-09-03 20:59:18
3748,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"Seriously? If I had waited for you, we would have missed the deadline. You were taking forever!",2024-09-03 21:01:18
3749,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,There's a difference between taking time to perfect something and just rushing it through. What was so wrong with my approach?,2024-09-03 21:06:18
3750,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,Your approach was going in circles and wasting time. We had to make a decision and move forward.,2024-09-03 21:08:18
3751,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,That’s easy for you to say when you make all the decisions unilaterally. This was supposed to be a team effort!,2024-09-03 21:18:18
3752,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,A team effort doesn’t mean dragging everyone down with indecisiveness. Sometimes a leader has to make tough decisions.,2024-09-03 21:22:18
3753,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,Leader? Who made you the leader? We’re supposed to be equal partners on this project!,2024-09-03 21:24:18
3754,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"Maybe if you acted with some urgency once in a while, I wouldn’t have to take charge.",2024-09-03 21:27:18
3755,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,"And maybe if you listened to other perspectives, you’d realize that rushing isn’t always the right answer.",2024-09-03 21:33:18
3756,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you’re accusing me of being closed-minded? That’s rich coming from someone who can’t handle a little pressure.",2024-09-03 21:36:18
3757,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,I can handle pressure just fine. What I can’t handle is a partner who undermines me at every turn.,2024-09-03 21:46:18
3758,escalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,Undermine you? I’m,2024-09-03 21:54:18
3759,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,I can't believe you deleted my project files without asking!,2024-09-03 20:51:21
3760,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, you know I needed that space for my game updates. Why didn’t you have a backup?",2024-09-03 20:57:21
3761,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,I shouldn’t need a backup because my brother is too careless to ask first!,2024-09-03 21:04:21
3762,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,Careless? You're always hogging the computer for your stupid school stuff!,2024-09-03 21:09:21
3763,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,School stuff? It’s not just “stuff.” It’s my final project worth 50% of my grade!,2024-09-03 21:10:21
3764,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"Yeah, well, maybe if you weren't so obsessed with perfection, it wouldn't take up so much space!",2024-09-03 21:13:21
3765,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,"Obsession with perfection is what gets me good grades, something you wouldn't understand!",2024-09-03 21:14:21
3766,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"There you go again, acting like you're better because of your grades.",2024-09-03 21:20:21
3767,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,"Not acting better, just being responsible. You should try it sometime.",2024-09-03 21:28:21
3768,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,Responsible? Like how you yelled at Mom for forgetting your printouts last week?,2024-09-03 21:36:21
3769,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,That’s different! She’s not the one deleting important files!,2024-09-03 21:44:21
3770,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"Maybe if you communicated more, people wouldn't have to guess what you need!",2024-09-03 21:54:21
3771,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,I shouldn’t have to spell out that deleting my project is a terrible idea!,2024-09-03 22:03:21
3772,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you didn’t leave everything until the last minute, this wouldn’t happen!",2024-09-03 22:09:21
3773,escalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,Last minute? I’ve been working,2024-09-03 22:11:21
3774,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,"Why didn't you listen to my instructions, Josh?",2024-09-03 20:59:26
3775,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,"Your instructions were confusing and unrealistic, Sarah!",2024-09-03 21:00:26
3776,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,They were clear enough if you actually paid attention.,2024-09-03 21:07:26
3777,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,You expect everyone to just understand your vague ideas instantly.,2024-09-03 21:11:26
3778,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_3,Can you both stop fighting? We need to finish this group project.,2024-09-03 21:20:26
3779,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,I wouldn’t need to fight if people like Josh could follow directions.,2024-09-03 21:28:26
3780,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it’s my fault? Typical.",2024-09-03 21:33:26
3781,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. We need to move forward.",2024-09-03 21:36:26
3782,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,It’s hard to move forward when someone keeps dragging us back.,2024-09-03 21:44:26
3783,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,I’m not dragging us back! Stop being so controlling!,2024-09-03 21:53:26
3784,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_3,Can we just split the tasks and work on our own parts?,2024-09-03 21:58:26
3785,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,"Sure, if that’s the only way to get something done.",2024-09-03 22:01:26
3786,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,Fine by me. I’m tired of arguing about this.,2024-09-03 22:11:26
3787,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_3,Great. Let’s just focus and finish this before the deadline.,2024-09-03 22:18:26
3788,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,I’ll handle the research part.,2024-09-03 22:20:26
3789,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,I’ll work on the presentation slides.,2024-09-03 22:21:26
3790,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_3,And I'll compile everything together at the end. Happy now?,2024-09-03 22:22:26
3791,escalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,"Whatever, let’s just get it done.",2024-09-03 22:26:26
3792,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design without asking, Toby?",2024-09-03 21:00:29
3793,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"Because your layout was the only one that made sense, Elise. We needed something that worked.",2024-09-03 21:01:29
3794,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,You could have at least talked to me first! It's my work and you just took it!,2024-09-03 21:07:29
3795,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"You're acting like I stole your Mona Lisa! We’re on the same team, remember?",2024-09-03 21:15:29
3796,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,"It’s not about the design, it’s about respect. You went behind my back!",2024-09-03 21:20:29
3797,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren’t so possessive about everything, I wouldn’t have to.",2024-09-03 21:27:29
3798,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,Possessive? I just want recognition for my work. Is that too much to ask?,2024-09-03 21:32:29
3799,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,And I want us to win this competition! Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for the bigger picture.,2024-09-03 21:40:29
3800,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,Sacrifices? You mean sacrifice my integrity and hard work?,2024-09-03 21:42:29
3801,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"If your integrity is so fragile that this breaks it, maybe it's not as strong as you think.",2024-09-03 21:51:29
3802,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,"Wow, really mature coming from someone who can’t even come up with their own ideas.",2024-09-03 21:58:29
3803,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"Maybe if you shared your ideas instead of hoarding them, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 22:08:29
3804,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,Sharing? You didn’t even give me a chance to share! You just took it!,2024-09-03 22:14:29
3805,escalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,Because you’re always so critical about everything I do! I,2024-09-03 22:22:29
3806,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the team meeting last night?,2024-09-03 20:55:33
3807,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,I didn't think it was important since you're never interested in our strategies anyway.,2024-09-03 21:01:33
3808,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,That's not true. I care about our gaming team just as much as you do!,2024-09-03 21:06:33
3809,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,Really? Because it sure doesn't seem like it. You skipped the last two meetings!,2024-09-03 21:12:33
3810,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,I had other commitments! You know that.,2024-09-03 21:17:33
3811,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,Funny how those 'other commitments' always pop up when it's something for the team.,2024-09-03 21:23:33
3812,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,You think I'm avoiding helping the team? That's ridiculous.,2024-09-03 21:27:33
3813,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,"Well, your actions speak louder than words. We're falling behind because of you.",2024-09-03 21:29:33
3814,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,I'm not the only one missing meetings! Others do it too!,2024-09-03 21:30:33
3815,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,"Still, you can't deny that you're more consistent at skipping than anyone else.",2024-09-03 21:33:33
3816,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,"Maybe if the meetings were more organized, I'd be inclined to attend.",2024-09-03 21:37:33
3817,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault that you can't manage your time?",2024-09-03 21:44:33
3818,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,I'm saying it could be more efficient. Someone has to point out the flaws.,2024-09-03 21:47:33
3819,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,And you choose to do that by not showing up? Great leadership.,2024-09-03 21:49:33
3820,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,At least I’m trying to address the problem instead of ignoring it.,2024-09-03 21:59:33
3821,escalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,Ignoring it? I'm the one trying to keep this team together. You're just making excuses.,2024-09-03 22:03:33
3822,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 20:53:36
3823,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal. It was just a piece of cake.,2024-09-03 20:56:36
3824,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_3,Seriously? We were all saving that for later. You always do this!,2024-09-03 21:05:36
3825,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! It's not like I do it on purpose. You should have eaten it earlier if you wanted it so badly.",2024-09-03 21:07:36
3826,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_4,That's not the point. The point is you didn't consider anyone else before just grabbing it.,2024-09-03 21:08:36
3827,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,"Fine, next time I'll ask. Happy now?",2024-09-03 21:17:36
3828,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,It's not just about asking. It's about respecting everyone's wishes. This keeps happening with other things too.,2024-09-03 21:22:36
3829,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,You're blowing this way out of proportion. It’s not like I commit some crime every time I eat something.,2024-09-03 21:29:36
3830,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_3,It feels like you don't value our opinions or feelings. It's like you always put yourself first.,2024-09-03 21:32:36
3831,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,Really? I'm selfish now? What about all the times I've shared my stuff with you?,2024-09-03 21:42:36
3832,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_4,Sharing sometimes doesn't change the fact that you're inconsiderate when it comes to common things.,2024-09-03 21:46:36
3833,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,Maybe you're the ones who need to relax and not make everything a big deal.,2024-09-03 21:50:36
3834,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,This isn't just about the cake. It's a pattern. It shows how little you think about us.,2024-09-03 21:56:36
3835,escalatory_conversation_260,speaker_3,Exactly! And it's frustrating always having to bring it up,2024-09-03 22:04:36
3836,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the study group last night?,2024-09-03 20:56:39
3837,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,I told you I had other things to take care of!,2024-09-03 21:06:39
3838,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,You always have an excuse. We needed you there.,2024-09-03 21:08:39
3839,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Oh please, like you guys can't handle it without me.",2024-09-03 21:18:39
3840,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,"Actually, we can't. Your part of the presentation isn't done.",2024-09-03 21:26:39
3841,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if someone else would step up for once!",2024-09-03 21:30:39
3842,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,That's not fair. We all have our parts. This is a group project.,2024-09-03 21:34:39
3843,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,And now we're behind because of you.,2024-09-03 21:41:39
3844,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe I should just drop out of the project!,2024-09-03 21:47:39
3845,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,Drop out? Seriously? That's your solution?,2024-09-03 21:53:39
3846,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,That's just running away from your responsibilities.,2024-09-03 21:58:39
3847,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Maybe if you both weren't so controlling, I'd feel more motivated to participate.",2024-09-03 22:00:39
3848,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,Controlling? We're trying to keep this from falling apart.,2024-09-03 22:04:39
3849,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,"We have deadlines, and you're making it impossible to meet them.",2024-09-03 22:13:39
3850,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Fine, you know what? Do it yourself. I'm done.",2024-09-03 22:22:39
3851,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,This isn't just about the project. This is about the team.,2024-09-03 22:28:39
3852,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,Do you even care about our grade?,2024-09-03 22:36:39
3853,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,Not if it means putting up with this micromanagement.,2024-09-03 22:45:39
3854,escalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,"If you leave, you'll tank everyone's grades, including your",2024-09-03 22:55:39
3855,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design and present it as your own in the meeting, David?",2024-09-03 20:58:42
3856,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Lisa. I just made some improvements. It's not like it was entirely your idea.",2024-09-03 21:03:42
3857,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,Improvements? You didn't even mention my name! You made it sound like you did all the work.,2024-09-03 21:06:42
3858,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if your original design wasn't so flawed, I wouldn't have had to spend hours fixing it.",2024-09-03 21:14:42
3859,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,"Flawed? Are you kidding me? That design took me weeks to perfect, and you just waltz in and claim it as yours!",2024-09-03 21:16:42
3860,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,"Perfect, huh? Then why did everyone love my version so much?",2024-09-03 21:24:42
3861,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,Because you presented it in a way that completely overshadowed my contributions! You know how much this project means to me.,2024-09-03 21:34:42
3862,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,"And it means nothing to me, Lisa? I've been working just as hard, in case you forgot.",2024-09-03 21:40:42
3863,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,That's not the point! You undermined my hard work and took all the credit.,2024-09-03 21:42:42
3864,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were better at presenting, this wouldn't have happened. Have you considered that?",2024-09-03 21:48:42
3865,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,"You're unbelievable! Instead of helping each other, you used my work to your advantage.",2024-09-03 21:55:42
3866,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,I didn't use it; I improved it. Can't you see the difference?,2024-09-03 22:01:42
3867,escalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,"No, David. I see someone who can't respect their teammate",2024-09-03 22:03:42
3868,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted your part of the project separately, Alex.",2024-09-03 20:52:45
3869,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,"I had to, Jordan. You were dragging the team down with your constant procrastination.",2024-09-03 20:58:45
3870,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"Are you serious? I've been doing my share. Maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't have this problem.",2024-09-03 21:05:45
3871,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,Communicated better? I've sent you countless messages that you conveniently ignored.,2024-09-03 21:13:45
3872,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,And you think doing everything solo is the right move? Now our project looks completely disjointed!,2024-09-03 21:23:45
3873,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,At least my section is done and polished. Yours was a mess of half-finished ideas.,2024-09-03 21:31:45
3874,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"You know what? Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, we could've worked as a team.",2024-09-03 21:41:45
3875,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,Control freak? I'm trying to save our grade because you can't get your act together.,2024-09-03 21:46:45
3876,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_3,Why are you two always at each other's throats? This whole thing is a disaster now because neither of you can compromise.,2024-09-03 21:48:45
3877,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"Oh great, thanks for joining, Lisa. Maybe if you actually contributed more, you could talk.",2024-09-03 21:53:45
3878,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,"Yeah, Lisa, sitting on the sidelines doesn't really qualify you to referee here.",2024-09-03 22:03:45
3879,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_3,"I have been contributing, in case either of you bothered to notice. I'm the one who kept pushing for regular meetings!",2024-09-03 22:06:45
3880,escalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"Fine, whatever. But look where your plans got us—everyone",2024-09-03 22:13:45
3881,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,I can't believe you moved out without even telling me first.,2024-09-03 20:59:48
3882,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,"Seriously, you knew I wasn’t happy. Do I need your permission now?",2024-09-03 21:02:48
3883,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,It's about common courtesy. We've been roommates for three years!,2024-09-03 21:09:48
3884,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,Common courtesy? Like when you use my stuff without asking?,2024-09-03 21:14:48
3885,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,That’s completely different. At least I've never ditched you when the rent is due!,2024-09-03 21:24:48
3886,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it’s about money? You know what your problem is? You never listen to anyone but yourself.",2024-09-03 21:26:48
3887,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,"My problem? Maybe if you weren’t so selfish, we wouldn’t be having this discussion.",2024-09-03 21:29:48
3888,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,Selfish? I put up with your mess and your loud parties for years!,2024-09-03 21:38:48
3889,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,Those parties were the only fun we ever had in that apartment. You’re just bitter because you have no social life!,2024-09-03 21:45:48
3890,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,Bitter? It’s called being responsible. Maybe you should try it sometime.,2024-09-03 21:50:48
3891,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,"Oh, so now I’m irresponsible? You’re hilarious. Why don’t you admit you're just insecure?",2024-09-03 21:57:48
3892,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,Insecure? I'm not the one who needs to surround myself with people to feel important.,2024-09-03 22:05:48
3893,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,"Wow, you really don’t know me at all. This conversation is a waste of time.",2024-09-03 22:15:48
3894,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,"Right, because running away from problems is what you're best at.",2024-09-03 22:16:48
3895,escalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,Believe,2024-09-03 22:24:48
3896,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you pass the ball, Sarah? We had a clear shot on goal!",2024-09-03 20:53:52
3897,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,"Oh right, because you've been nailing all your shots today?",2024-09-03 20:57:52
3898,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_3,"Come on, this isn’t helping. We need to figure out what went wrong, not point fingers.",2024-09-03 21:02:52
3899,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,We wouldn't have to if Sarah knew how to play as a team!,2024-09-03 21:09:52
3900,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,"And maybe if you weren't barking orders all the time, we'd actually play better!",2024-09-03 21:10:52
3901,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously. We're losing because we're not working together. Let’s focus on fixing that.",2024-09-03 21:15:52
3902,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Alex. You had your head in the clouds the whole game.",2024-09-03 21:25:52
3903,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_3,I’m just trying to keep us from falling apart here. Can we all just calm down and talk this out?,2024-09-03 21:30:52
3904,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,Talking won't magically make us a better team if some people don’t listen.,2024-09-03 21:31:52
3905,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,So now you’re saying I don’t listen? How about you learn to follow through?,2024-09-03 21:35:52
3906,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_3,This isn’t solving anything. How about we take a break and come back to this with clear heads?,2024-09-03 21:45:52
3907,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,"Fine, but next time, don’t expect me to stay quiet if someone screws up.",2024-09-03 21:51:52
3908,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,And don’t expect me to stay quiet if you’re going to keep bossing everyone around.,2024-09-03 21:54:52
3909,escalatory_conversation_265,speaker_3,Can we at least agree to try focusing on,2024-09-03 22:00:52
3910,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you follow the game plan, Jack? We’re losing because you keep hogging the ball.",2024-09-03 20:51:55
3911,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. At least I'm trying to make something happen. You just keep passing it back!",2024-09-03 20:56:55
3912,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,"That’s because I'm looking for an actual team effort, not a one-man show.",2024-09-03 20:58:55
3913,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_3,"Both of you, this isn’t helping! We need to focus on how to turn the game around, not tearing each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:07:55
3914,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_4,"Yeah, but Sarah’s right. Jack, you’re not playing as part of the team.",2024-09-03 21:14:55
3915,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Tom, you’re not the one who has to score all the points.",2024-09-03 21:24:55
3916,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_4,We’re a team. It's not just your job to score—we all need to contribute.,2024-09-03 21:31:55
3917,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,We’re not going to win if we can’t play together. Can we just stick to the plan next half?,2024-09-03 21:35:55
3918,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,"Fine, I’ll pass more. But you guys better step up and do something with it.",2024-09-03 21:44:55
3919,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_3,Deal. Let’s just make sure we’re actually communicating on the field.,2024-09-03 21:52:55
3920,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_4,Agreed. Let's put our differences aside and focus on winning. We can sort this out after the game.,2024-09-03 21:55:55
3921,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,"Alright, let’s do it. No more arguing, just playing.",2024-09-03 22:04:55
3922,escalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,Okay. Let’s get out there,2024-09-03 22:13:55
3923,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were making changes to the project, Sarah?",2024-09-03 20:53:58
3924,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,"I didn't think I needed to, Adam. It's not like you were contributing much anyway.",2024-09-03 20:59:58
3925,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"That's not fair, and you know it. I was handling the data analysis just fine.",2024-09-03 21:01:58
3926,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,Fine? Your analysis was full of errors! I had to redo half of it.,2024-09-03 21:11:58
3927,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're the expert? I'm sorry my work doesn't meet your ""perfection"" standards.",2024-09-03 21:14:58
3928,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,At least I aim for perfection. You seem perfectly fine with mediocrity.,2024-09-03 21:24:58
3929,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,Mediocrity? You're the one who rushed through the coding just to get it done.,2024-09-03 21:29:58
3930,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,"Maybe if you had been quicker with your part, I wouldn't have had to rush!",2024-09-03 21:33:58
3931,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,This is exactly why I hate working with you. You're always so high and mighty.,2024-09-03 21:39:58
3932,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,And you're always so slow and careless. We're never going to finish at this rate.,2024-09-03 21:42:58
3933,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,Maybe we wouldn't be behind if you weren't changing everything without consulting me!,2024-09-03 21:52:58
3934,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,"And maybe if you weren't so incompetent, I wouldn't have to!",2024-09-03 22:01:58
3935,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"I can't believe we're stuck in this. Honestly, I feel like quitting.",2024-09-03 22:05:58
3936,escalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,Maybe that would be best for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:15:58
3937,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn’t tell me about changing our research project topic without consulting me!,2024-09-03 21:00:01
3938,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal. The topic we had was going nowhere, and we needed something new.",2024-09-03 21:09:01
3939,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,Needed something new? We were just starting to make progress!,2024-09-03 21:19:01
3940,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,"Progress? More like spinning our wheels. Face it, your idea was a dead end.",2024-09-03 21:28:01
3941,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,"So, my ideas are worthless now? Is that what you're saying?",2024-09-03 21:33:01
3942,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,"Stop twisting my words! I'm just saying we needed a fresh direction, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:43:01
3943,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,"Funny how you decided to take that ""fresh direction"" on your own. Ever heard of teamwork?",2024-09-03 21:45:01
3944,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,I was trying to save the team! Your stubbornness was holding us back.,2024-09-03 21:53:01
3945,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,Or maybe you're just a control freak who can't handle collaboration!,2024-09-03 21:57:01
3946,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,Don’t act like you’re innocent here. You’ve been shutting down every suggestion that wasn’t yours.,2024-09-03 22:07:01
3947,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,That’s because your suggestions are always half-baked and impulsive.,2024-09-03 22:12:01
3948,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,At least I’m trying to come up with solutions instead of clinging to a sinking ship.,2024-09-03 22:18:01
3949,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,"A sinking ship? Oh, so now our original plan is a sinking ship? Why didn't you say that earlier instead of going behind my back?",2024-09-03 22:20:01
3950,escalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,Maybe because you react just like this—expl,2024-09-03 22:25:01
3951,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,Why didn’t you pass me the ball when I was open? We could have tied the game!,2024-09-03 20:53:04
3952,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,"Because every time I do, you miss the shot! I'm tired of losing because of you.",2024-09-03 21:02:04
3953,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_3,Both of you need to quit blaming each other. We lost because we didn’t play as a team.,2024-09-03 21:11:04
3954,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,It’s hard to play as a team when some people think they can do everything themselves!,2024-09-03 21:15:04
3955,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn’t have to if you guys could follow the plan for once!,2024-09-03 21:16:04
3956,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_4,This is going nowhere. Arguing isn’t going to fix anything. We need to figure out what went wrong.,2024-09-03 21:17:04
3957,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,What went wrong is that some people think they’re above everyone else!,2024-09-03 21:27:04
3958,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,And some people can’t handle a little criticism. Grow up!,2024-09-03 21:35:04
3959,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_3,"Enough! If we keep this up, we’re never going to improve. Can’t we at least agree on what to work on next?",2024-09-03 21:43:04
3960,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,"Fine, but I’m still not happy with how things went down. We can’t ignore this.",2024-09-03 21:45:04
3961,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,Agreed. But let's focus on the game plan next time. Everyone needs to step up.,2024-09-03 21:55:04
3962,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_4,So we all agree to work on communication and teamwork? Can we at least start there?,2024-09-03 22:05:04
3963,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,"Communication, yes. And actually following through with our roles.",2024-09-03 22:15:04
3964,escalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,Fine.,2024-09-03 22:25:04
3965,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,"Why didn't you do your part of the group project, Mia?",2024-09-03 20:53:06
3966,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,"I did my part, Alex. You just never bothered to communicate properly!",2024-09-03 20:57:06
3967,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,That's a lie! All you did was send a few short messages at midnight. How is anyone supposed to work with that?,2024-09-03 20:58:06
3968,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,"Maybe if you checked your phone more often, you wouldn't miss them!",2024-09-03 21:08:06
3969,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,"Oh, and it's my fault now? Classic. Always blaming others for your mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:12:06
3970,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,My mistakes? You're the one who took full control without asking anyone's opinion.,2024-09-03 21:14:06
3971,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,Someone had to take charge because you were slacking off!,2024-09-03 21:21:06
3972,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,"Taking charge doesn't mean being a dictator, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:29:06
3973,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,And being a team member doesn't mean disappearing and showing up last minute!,2024-09-03 21:36:06
3974,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,I showed up for every meeting I could! Maybe if you scheduled them at reasonable times...,2024-09-03 21:42:06
3975,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,"Right, because accommodating your schedule is more important than everyone else's.",2024-09-03 21:46:06
3976,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,It’s called compromise! Something you clearly don’t understand.,2024-09-03 21:50:06
3977,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,Compromise? When have you ever compromised? You just expect everyone to cater to you.,2024-09-03 21:58:06
3978,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the villain? When you're the one bossing everyone around?",2024-09-03 21:59:06
3979,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,I'm trying to get us a decent grade! Something you'd know nothing about.,2024-09-03 22:01:06
3980,escalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,Maybe if you weren't so obsessed with,2024-09-03 22:07:06
3981,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,I can't believe you bailed on the project last minute!,2024-09-03 20:52:10
3982,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"I had an emergency, okay? It's not like I planned it!",2024-09-03 20:56:10
3983,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,You always have an excuse. You're so unreliable!,2024-09-03 21:03:10
3984,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"Oh, I'm unreliable? What about the time you missed two meetings in a row?",2024-09-03 21:08:10
3985,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,Those were different! I had legitimate reasons!,2024-09-03 21:09:10
3986,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"Convenient how your reasons are always legit, but mine aren't.",2024-09-03 21:16:10
3987,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,"Because your ""reasons"" are always flimsy! Like that time you said your dog ate your homework!",2024-09-03 21:19:10
3988,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"That actually happened, and you know it!",2024-09-03 21:24:10
3989,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,Whatever. This project is tanking because of you.,2024-09-03 21:26:10
3990,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"Funny, I was thinking the same thing about you. You haven't exactly been pulling your weight.",2024-09-03 21:36:10
3991,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,I did most of the research! You barely did anything!,2024-09-03 21:37:10
3992,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"And I did all the writing! But sure, go ahead, claim all the credit.",2024-09-03 21:45:10
3993,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,"If you had just communicated better, this wouldn't be such a mess.",2024-09-03 21:54:10
3994,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,Communication? Seriously? You're the worst at keeping people in the loop.,2024-09-03 21:58:10
3995,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,At least I try! You just disappear when things get tough.,2024-09-03 22:06:10
3996,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't disappear if you weren't so impossible to work with.,2024-09-03 22:09:10
3997,escalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault you're a flake?",2024-09-03 22:18:10
3998,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,You can't just take things from my room without asking!,2024-09-03 20:52:13
3999,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! It's just a pen. You have hundreds of them.",2024-09-03 21:00:13
4000,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,"That's not the point! You always do this, and it's super disrespectful.",2024-09-03 21:05:13
4001,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"Disrespectful? Seriously? We share the same house, why make such a big deal over a pen?",2024-09-03 21:08:13
4002,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,It's the principle! It shows you don't respect my things or my space.,2024-09-03 21:16:13
4003,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"You're overreacting. If you were so particular, you should've locked your room.",2024-09-03 21:18:13
4004,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,Or you could just learn to ask before taking!,2024-09-03 21:25:13
4005,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,Like you ask before borrowing my charger? Hypocrisy much?,2024-09-03 21:26:13
4006,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,"I do ask most times, and when I don't, I apologize!",2024-09-03 21:30:13
4007,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"Sure, only after I've noticed and confronted you about it.",2024-09-03 21:37:13
4008,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,"This is about mutual respect, not keeping score!",2024-09-03 21:43:13
4009,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"Mutual respect? Coming from someone who snoops through my stuff whenever you're ""cleaning""?",2024-09-03 21:45:13
4010,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,"That's different! I'm cleaning to help out, not snooping.",2024-09-03 21:53:13
4011,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,Help out? By invading my privacy and tossing my things like they're trash?,2024-09-03 22:03:13
4012,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,"Maybe if you cleaned up once in a while, I wouldn't have to!",2024-09-03 22:10:13
4013,escalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"And maybe if you respected my boundaries, I wouldn't feel so violated all the time!",2024-09-03 22:16:13
4014,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,I can't believe you deleted the project files without even asking me!,2024-09-03 20:53:16
4015,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,"Oh, don't act like you were doing anything useful with them.",2024-09-03 20:55:16
4016,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,That's not your decision to make! We needed those files for our presentation.,2024-09-03 21:01:16
4017,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you paid attention during meetings, you would know we changed the focus.",2024-09-03 21:08:16
4018,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,I was paying attention! You never communicated that clearly.,2024-09-03 21:09:16
4019,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,Seriously? How many times did we have to repeat it? Maybe you should start taking notes.,2024-09-03 21:13:16
4020,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,Taking notes won't help if you keep changing your mind every other day.,2024-09-03 21:22:16
4021,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,"Changing my mind? At least I'm trying to make progress, unlike you, who just sits back.",2024-09-03 21:25:16
4022,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,Progress? More like creating chaos! Your constant changes are why we're behind schedule!,2024-09-03 21:27:16
4023,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,And your lack of initiative is why we have to keep making changes in the first place!,2024-09-03 21:33:16
4024,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,You know what? Maybe I should just handle this project on my own.,2024-09-03 21:36:16
4025,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,"Fine, good luck with that. Don't come crying to me when you mess it up!",2024-09-03 21:37:16
4026,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,As if I would need your help. You've been nothing but a hindrance.,2024-09-03 21:46:16
4027,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,A hindrance? Try being the only one putting in any real effort!,2024-09-03 21:54:16
4028,escalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,Real effort? You're delusional. All you've done is create problems.,2024-09-03 22:01:16
4029,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you changed the deadline for the group project?,2024-09-03 20:54:18
4030,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,"I didn't change it, I just told everyone we need to finish earlier to get things done right.",2024-09-03 21:01:18
4031,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,That's basically changing it without asking anyone! Who gave you that authority?,2024-09-03 21:07:18
4032,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_3,"Yeah, I didn't know about this either. How are we supposed to plan if you keep making decisions on your own?",2024-09-03 21:17:18
4033,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,I was just trying to make sure we don't screw up the presentation. Shouldn't you be more grateful?,2024-09-03 21:27:18
4034,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,"Grateful? We have our own schedules too, you know. Now I have to rearrange everything last minute.",2024-09-03 21:30:18
4035,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_3,"It's not fair to just spring this on us. Communication is supposed to be key, remember?",2024-09-03 21:31:18
4036,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you both kept up with the group chat, you would know what's going on.",2024-09-03 21:36:18
4037,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,Don't blame this on us. It's your responsibility to make sure everyone is on the same page when you change things.,2024-09-03 21:37:18
4038,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_3,"Exactly! This affects all of us, not just you. We need to decide things together.",2024-09-03 21:40:18
4039,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,"Fine, what do you want me to do then? Go back and undo it?",2024-09-03 21:41:18
4040,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,A start would be at least talking to us before making decisions like this. Is that too much to ask?,2024-09-03 21:45:18
4041,escalatory_conversation_274,speaker_3,"We just need to work as a team, not individuals doing",2024-09-03 21:51:18
4042,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,"You’re kidding me, right? We’re already late, and now you say you forgot the concert tickets?",2024-09-03 21:01:21
4043,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you hadn't insisted on bringing the wrong bag, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:04:21
4044,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,"Oh, so it's my fault now? You were the one who checked the tickets last night!",2024-09-03 21:09:21
4045,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,And you were the one who saw me put them in that bag! You could have reminded me!,2024-09-03 21:14:21
4046,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,Reminded you? Are you seriously saying it’s my job to babysit your memory?,2024-09-03 21:20:21
4047,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"Oh please, like you haven't forgotten crucial things before!",2024-09-03 21:22:21
4048,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,At least I own up to my mistakes instead of blaming everyone else!,2024-09-03 21:26:21
4049,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"I’m not blaming, I’m just stating facts! You could stand to be a little more helpful!",2024-09-03 21:35:21
4050,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,"Helpful? I drove us all the way here, planned this whole trip, and now it's my fault?",2024-09-03 21:44:21
4051,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"Maybe if your planning was better, we wouldn’t be dealing with this!",2024-09-03 21:45:21
4052,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,Unbelievable! You never appreciate anything I do!,2024-09-03 21:46:21
4053,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,And you never try to understand things from my perspective!,2024-09-03 21:54:21
4054,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,Because your perspective is always about deflecting blame!,2024-09-03 22:01:21
4055,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,You know what? Forget it. Just drive us back home. This night is ruined.,2024-09-03 22:07:21
4056,escalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,Fine. Maybe you can learn to take,2024-09-03 22:11:21
4057,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took my design without asking, Lisa.",2024-09-03 20:56:24
4058,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Mark? It's a team project. Your designs are for everyone.",2024-09-03 21:05:24
4059,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,It doesn't work that way. You should've at least asked me before presenting it as your own!,2024-09-03 21:06:24
4060,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. You act like you're the only one who did any work on this.",2024-09-03 21:13:24
4061,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,"I put in hours of my time, and then you just swoop in and take credit?",2024-09-03 21:23:24
4062,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,You're blowing this out of proportion. It's just a school project.,2024-09-03 21:29:24
4063,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,"School project or not, it's about respect. You didn't even acknowledge my effort.",2024-09-03 21:39:24
4064,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,And what about my effort? Do you think I haven't been working hard too?,2024-09-03 21:43:24
4065,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,"Of course I do, but that doesn't give you the right to take my work without permission.",2024-09-03 21:51:24
4066,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"If you care so much about credit, maybe you should've spoken up during the meeting.",2024-09-03 21:59:24
4067,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,There wasn't even a chance to. You jumped in before I could say anything.,2024-09-03 22:04:24
4068,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"Oh please, you just want to make a big deal out of nothing. Typical.",2024-09-03 22:13:24
4069,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,Typical? That's rich coming from someone who never respects others' input.,2024-09-03 22:18:24
4070,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"Maybe if your input was more collaborative and less about showing off, people would respect it more.",2024-09-03 22:28:24
4071,escalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,Collaboration doesn't mean,2024-09-03 22:30:24
4072,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,"I can't believe you parked in my spot again, Tim! This is the third time this week!",2024-09-03 20:54:27
4073,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,"Oh come on, Sarah, it's just a parking spot. There's plenty of room in the lot.",2024-09-03 20:59:27
4074,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,That's not the point. It's designated for me because I need quick access to the building!,2024-09-03 21:03:27
4075,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,You always overreact. There's no need for reserved spots here anyway.,2024-09-03 21:13:27
4076,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,"Overreact? If you understood the importance of my role, you’d respect the reservation.",2024-09-03 21:14:27
4077,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,Importance of your role? Like what you do is any more crucial than what the rest of us do here.,2024-09-03 21:16:27
4078,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,"That’s not for you to decide, Tim. The company designated that spot to me for a reason.",2024-09-03 21:22:27
4079,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,"Yeah, probably because you nagged until they gave in.",2024-09-03 21:32:27
4080,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,You have no idea what you're talking about. Why can’t you just follow the rules?,2024-09-03 21:39:27
4081,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,Maybe because I’m tired of arbitrary rules for people who think they're better than everyone else.,2024-09-03 21:49:27
4082,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,This isn’t about being better. It’s about efficiency and respect. Something you clearly don’t grasp.,2024-09-03 21:51:27
4083,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,Efficiency? Don’t make me laugh. You just want to feel special.,2024-09-03 21:58:27
4084,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,That’s absurd. I need that spot because I often carry heavy equipment and need to move quickly.,2024-09-03 22:04:27
4085,escalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,Heavy equipment. Sure. More like,2024-09-03 22:11:27
4086,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot to submit the group project, Mark!",2024-09-03 20:55:30
4087,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,"Oh, don't pin this all on me, Emma! You didn't remind me once about the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:02:30
4088,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,"Remind you? We agreed to keep track of our own responsibilities, didn't we?",2024-09-03 21:03:30
4089,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. This isn't helping. We all have a part to play in this.",2024-09-03 21:13:30
4090,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Sarah. You barely contributed to the project anyway!",2024-09-03 21:18:30
4091,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_3,That's not true and you know it. I did all the research while you two focused on writing.,2024-09-03 21:20:30
4092,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,"And yet it still didn't get submitted! How could you drop the ball like that, Mark?",2024-09-03 21:21:30
4093,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,"Maybe if you hadn't been nitpicking every little detail, I'd have more time to submit it.",2024-09-03 21:23:30
4094,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,Nitpicking? I was making sure we met the requirements!,2024-09-03 21:24:30
4095,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_3,"Look, blaming each other isn't going to fix the fact that we're about to fail this course.",2024-09-03 21:33:30
4096,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,"So what's your grand solution, Sarah? To just sit here and take the F?",2024-09-03 21:35:30
4097,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_3,"No, but we need to talk to the professor and see if there's any way to get an extension.",2024-09-03 21:39:30
4098,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,You think the professor will give us an extension after we missed the deadline?,2024-09-03 21:48:30
4099,escalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,"We don't know unless we try. But Emma, if you're so",2024-09-03 21:52:30
4100,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"Why do you always have to mess up our band rehearsals, Jamie?",2024-09-03 20:54:33
4101,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"Oh, because I'm the only one who messes up? What about your constant out-of-tune guitar, Ben?",2024-09-03 20:58:33
4102,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_3,Could you both just stop it? We're never going to get ready for the show like this!,2024-09-03 21:04:33
4103,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, Sara! Jamie, you missed the beat at least five times today.",2024-09-03 21:12:33
4104,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually showed up on time, we could have more practice and fewer mistakes!",2024-09-03 21:17:33
4105,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_3,"Guys, this show is really important to us. Can we focus on fixing things instead of blaming each other?",2024-09-03 21:24:33
4106,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"Well, maybe we should focus on fixing Jamie’s sense of rhythm first!",2024-09-03 21:31:33
4107,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"Seriously, Ben? You want to talk rhythm? You're the one dragging the tempo every time!",2024-09-03 21:35:33
4108,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_3,We’re not getting anywhere with this. Can we at least agree on what went wrong and how to fix it?,2024-09-03 21:39:33
4109,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"Fine. I'll admit my guitar was a bit off today, but Jamie has to stop rushing through the chorus.",2024-09-03 21:45:33
4110,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"And I'll admit I was rushing, but your guitar really throws me off, Ben.",2024-09-03 21:55:33
4111,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_3,"Alright, can we try going through the chorus slowly together to fix both issues?",2024-09-03 21:59:33
4112,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"Yeah, we can give that a shot.",2024-09-03 22:08:33
4113,escalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"Agreed, let’s",2024-09-03 22:17:33
4114,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you show up for band practice again, Joe?",2024-09-03 20:53:36
4115,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,"I told you, Tom, I had other commitments. It’s not like the world revolves around this band.",2024-09-03 20:54:36
4116,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_1,Other commitments? You’ve used that excuse three times this month. We’re counting on you!,2024-09-03 20:55:36
4117,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_3,"Seriously, Joe, it’s not fair. If we’re going to make it to the talent show, everyone needs to be dedicated.",2024-09-03 21:01:36
4118,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,Are you all saying I’m not dedicated? I’m the one who brought us together in the first place!,2024-09-03 21:07:36
4119,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_4,"No one’s denying that, but you’ve been letting us down lately, and it's affecting our practice.",2024-09-03 21:11:36
4120,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,"Oh, so now everything’s my fault? Maybe if you all practiced more on your own, we wouldn’t be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:21:36
4121,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_1,"That’s not fair, Joe. We’ve been putting in extra hours while you’re off doing whatever.",2024-09-03 21:25:36
4122,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_3,It’s true. We even stayed late last week when you didn’t show up.,2024-09-03 21:28:36
4123,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,"Fine, you’re all perfect. Guess I’m just the weak link then.",2024-09-03 21:37:36
4124,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_4,"We’re not perfect. We just need you to be here, to pull your weight like everyone else.",2024-09-03 21:40:36
4125,escalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,And I need you all to understand that I have a life outside of this. Is that too much to ask?,2024-09-03 21:45:36
4126,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,"Why did you change the project plan without consulting anyone, Sarah?",2024-09-03 20:53:39
4127,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,I had to make adjustments because the original plan was unrealistic.,2024-09-03 21:01:39
4128,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_3,"Unbelievable, Sarah! You always take matters into your own hands without considering the team.",2024-09-03 21:05:39
4129,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,It's not my fault nobody else was doing anything. We were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:13:39
4130,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,We have a team for a reason. You can't just go rogue every time you think things won't work out.,2024-09-03 21:14:39
4131,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you stepped up as the leader, I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 21:18:39
4132,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_3,"That's not fair, Sarah. We're all trying our best.",2024-09-03 21:20:39
4133,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,Trying isn't good enough! We needed action.,2024-09-03 21:28:39
4134,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,And now we have chaos because you couldn't follow the process.,2024-09-03 21:31:39
4135,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_3,"Seriously, Sarah, now we have double the work to fix the mess you created.",2024-09-03 21:32:39
4136,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,"Fine, just blame me for everything. But at least something got done.",2024-09-03 21:34:39
4137,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,Something? You set us back days because you didn't think it through.,2024-09-03 21:35:39
4138,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_3,We had a plan for a reason. Your changes undermined all our efforts.,2024-09-03 21:45:39
4139,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,Whatever. Maybe you should have a better plan next time.,2024-09-03 21:49:39
4140,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,Or maybe you should learn to communicate instead of taking over like a dictator.,2024-09-03 21:51:39
4141,escalatory_conversation_281,speaker_3,"At this rate, we may as well kiss the project deadline goodbye",2024-09-03 21:52:39
4142,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,You seriously think it's okay to skip band practice just because you don't feel like it?,2024-09-03 20:55:42
4143,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,It's not like I'm the only one who misses practice sometimes. Why are you singling me out?,2024-09-03 20:57:42
4144,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,Because you miss more practices than anyone else! You're dragging the whole band down!,2024-09-03 21:03:42
4145,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,"Oh please, like the band revolves around me. Maybe if we played better songs, I'd actually want to show up.",2024-09-03 21:08:42
4146,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_3,Can you both stop? This isn't helping us prepare for the competition next month.,2024-09-03 21:16:42
4147,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,"That's the thing, speaker_3. We won't be ready for the competition if speaker_2 keeps flaking out on us!",2024-09-03 21:17:42
4148,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,"I'm not flaking out! I have other things going on, unlike some people who have nothing better to do.",2024-09-03 21:27:42
4149,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_4,Can we at least try to work together for once? Blaming each other won't fix anything.,2024-09-03 21:36:42
4150,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,"It's not about blame, speaker_4. It's about commitment. We all agreed to this, and speaker_2 isn't holding up their end of the deal.",2024-09-03 21:40:42
4151,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so overbearing, I'd feel more committed. Ever think about that?",2024-09-03 21:44:42
4152,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,Overbearing? I'm just trying to hold us to a standard. That's what leaders do.,2024-09-03 21:52:42
4153,escalatory_conversation_282,speaker_3,Can we please just focus on what we need to do to improve instead of tearing each other apart?,2024-09-03 21:53:42
4154,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't follow the recipe! The cake is ruined!,2024-09-03 20:55:45
4155,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,"Oh, please! It wouldn't have been ruined if you hadn't insisted on adding those extra ingredients.",2024-09-03 20:57:45
4156,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,Extra ingredients? You mean the ones that were supposed to enhance the flavor? You're impossible!,2024-09-03 21:01:45
4157,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,Impossible? Me? You're the control freak who can't handle any deviation from the plan!,2024-09-03 21:03:45
4158,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously? We're supposed to be working together on this bake sale, not tearing each other apart!",2024-09-03 21:13:45
4159,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, John! If Sara had just listened to me, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:21:45
4160,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,"Don't blame me, Emily! You're the one who always has to be the boss of everything!",2024-09-03 21:23:45
4161,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_3,"Enough! Look, we can salvage this. But we need to stop pointing fingers and start working together.",2024-09-03 21:31:45
4162,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,"Fine, but someone has to take responsibility for this disaster.",2024-09-03 21:41:45
4163,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,And you think that's going to be me? Not a chance!,2024-09-03 21:46:45
4164,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_3,This isn't helping! Let's just decide on what to do next. Can we agree on that?,2024-09-03 21:47:45
4165,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,Maybe if Sara stops acting like a know-it-all.,2024-09-03 21:49:45
4166,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,And maybe if Emily stops being so stubborn!,2024-09-03 21:53:45
4167,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_3,"Okay, enough! How about we focus on fixing the cake rather than fixing blame?",2024-09-03 22:00:45
4168,escalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,Fine. But I get to lead this,2024-09-03 22:06:45
4169,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,"Why did you have to use my presentation slides without asking me first, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:56:47
4170,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, Chris. We’re supposed to be a team!",2024-09-03 21:00:47
4171,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,A team? You mean since when does a team member just take someone else's work without permission?,2024-09-03 21:02:47
4172,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,I just thought it would save us time. You’re always saying we need to work more efficiently.,2024-09-03 21:04:47
4173,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,Efficiently doesn’t mean cutting corners or disrespecting each other’s contributions! You should have at least asked.,2024-09-03 21:09:47
4174,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,"And what, wait for hours for you to get back to me? We had a deadline!",2024-09-03 21:19:47
4175,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,"Excuses. You always do this, Alex. You act like your way is always the best and ignore everyone else.",2024-09-03 21:21:47
4176,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,"Oh please, don’t act all innocent. Remember last month when you went ahead with your own version of the project proposal without consulting anyone?",2024-09-03 21:27:47
4177,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,That was different. That was an emergency and it wasn't about stealing someone else's work!,2024-09-03 21:31:47
4178,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,"So you're justified, but I'm not? That’s just double standards!",2024-09-03 21:33:47
4179,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_3,"Can you both please calm down? We need to focus on the bigger picture here, our project is at stake.",2024-09-03 21:35:47
4180,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,It's hard to focus when someone keeps undermining the team.,2024-09-03 21:37:47
4181,escalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,Undermining? You’re impossible! If you can’t see that I,2024-09-03 21:43:47
4182,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,I can't believe you still haven't finished the research report. It's due tomorrow!,2024-09-03 21:01:50
4183,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Maybe if you had done your part, I wouldn't be so behind!",2024-09-03 21:03:50
4184,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,Excuse me? I did all the data collection. You were supposed to analyze it!,2024-09-03 21:07:50
4185,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,"Yeah, and I would have if you hadn't dumped it all on me at the last minute.",2024-09-03 21:09:50
4186,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_3,"Both of you need to calm down. We're on the same team, remember?",2024-09-03 21:17:50
4187,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,Calm down? Easy for you to say; you've done nothing but sit back and criticize.,2024-09-03 21:24:50
4188,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_3,"That's not fair. I offered to help multiple times, but neither of you listened.",2024-09-03 21:31:50
4189,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,You call that offering help? More like micromanaging and making things worse.,2024-09-03 21:38:50
4190,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,Can we stop pointing fingers and actually find a solution? We're running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:40:50
4191,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_3,"Agreed, but we need to divide the remaining tasks right now. No more excuses.",2024-09-03 21:44:50
4192,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,"Fine, I'll finish analyzing the data if you both promise to review and compile it into the report.",2024-09-03 21:48:50
4193,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,"Deal, but I want to see the analysis progress by the end of the day. No more delays.",2024-09-03 21:49:50
4194,escalatory_conversation_285,speaker_3,And I'll handle the formatting and proofreading once we're done. We can still pull this off if we focus.,2024-09-03 21:58:50
4195,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,Why did you touch my project without asking?,2024-09-03 20:58:53
4196,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,I didn't know it was a big deal. It was just sitting there.,2024-09-03 21:02:53
4197,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,Of course it's a big deal! It took me hours to get it right.,2024-09-03 21:12:53
4198,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,"Well, maybe you should have put a sign on it or something.",2024-09-03 21:19:53
4199,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,I shouldn't have to put a sign on it! It's obvious that it's mine.,2024-09-03 21:23:53
4200,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,"Honestly, if it’s that important to you, you should have kept it somewhere safe.",2024-09-03 21:25:53
4201,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,Are you seriously blaming me for your irresponsibility?,2024-09-03 21:31:53
4202,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,I'm not responsible for your paranoia. Get over it.,2024-09-03 21:36:53
4203,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,It's not paranoia! It's respect! Something you clearly lack.,2024-09-03 21:45:53
4204,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,"Oh please, spare me the lecture. You're always over-reacting.",2024-09-03 21:55:53
4205,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,And you're always under-reacting! It's like you don't care about anyone else.,2024-09-03 22:05:53
4206,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,Maybe because I'm not the one constantly making a fuss about everything.,2024-09-03 22:14:53
4207,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,You know what? Forget it. I can't depend on you for anything.,2024-09-03 22:21:53
4208,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,Fine by me. I don’t need this drama in my life.,2024-09-03 22:28:53
4209,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,Just stay away from my stuff from now on.,2024-09-03 22:33:53
4210,escalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,You won't have to tell me twice.,2024-09-03 22:37:53
4211,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,You seriously think this is all my fault?,2024-09-03 20:54:56
4212,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,"Well, who else should I blame? You’re the one who forgot to submit the project on time!",2024-09-03 21:00:56
4213,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,I would’ve submitted it if you’d finished your part like you promised.,2024-09-03 21:08:56
4214,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,Don’t turn this around on me. I did my part; you were just too lazy to put it all together.,2024-09-03 21:16:56
4215,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_3,Can you both just stop? This blaming game isn’t helping anyone.,2024-09-03 21:22:56
4216,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,Easy for you to say. You didn’t have to deal with all the last-minute changes.,2024-09-03 21:29:56
4217,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,Last-minute changes that we had to make because you didn’t plan properly in the first place!,2024-09-03 21:37:56
4218,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't getting us anywhere. We need to figure out a solution, not point fingers.",2024-09-03 21:40:56
4219,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,How about you tell that to Mr. High-and-Mighty over here who thinks he’s perfect?,2024-09-03 21:46:56
4220,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,"Oh, I’m far from perfect, but at least I know how to meet a deadline.",2024-09-03 21:48:56
4221,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_3,"Seriously, enough. We’re supposed to be a team.",2024-09-03 21:52:56
4222,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,Some team when one person gets all the blame.,2024-09-03 22:01:56
4223,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,Maybe you’d get less blame if you actually showed some responsibility.,2024-09-03 22:03:56
4224,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_3,Can we at least agree to meet later and figure out how to fix this?,2024-09-03 22:09:56
4225,escalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,"Why bother? Clearly, we can’t work",2024-09-03 22:17:56
4226,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and pitched my idea without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:01:59
4227,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, you weren't doing anything with it. It was just sitting there.",2024-09-03 21:08:59
4228,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,"That's not the point! It was my idea, not yours to take credit for.",2024-09-03 21:11:59
4229,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you had acted faster, I wouldn't have had to step in.",2024-09-03 21:21:59
4230,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,Stepping in doesn't mean stealing someone else's work!,2024-09-03 21:28:59
4231,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"Look, I was just trying to help the team. We needed something, and you were dragging your feet.",2024-09-03 21:37:59
4232,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,Helping the team? You mean helping yourself to my hard work!,2024-09-03 21:46:59
4233,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"You're overreacting. The important thing is that we got the job done, right?",2024-09-03 21:54:59
4234,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,"No, the important thing is respecting each other's contributions. You clearly don't get that.",2024-09-03 21:55:59
4235,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"You're impossible. I made that idea better, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:58:59
4236,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,That's not the issue. You completely disregarded the effort I put into it.,2024-09-03 22:02:59
4237,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,And you disregarded the urgency of the situation. We can't afford to wait on you forever.,2024-09-03 22:06:59
4238,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,Urgency doesn't give you the right to undermine me.,2024-09-03 22:16:59
4239,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more reliable, this wouldn't have happened!",2024-09-03 22:23:59
4240,escalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,"Reliable? I've been carrying this team for months, while you swoop in and claim the glory.",2024-09-03 22:33:59
4241,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,Why didn’t you check your email before submitting the group project? Now we look unprepared.,2024-09-03 21:01:02
4242,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,"I told you I was busy with my part of the research! You could've done a quick review too, you know.",2024-09-03 21:11:02
4243,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,Really? You're the one who insisted on handling the final submission.,2024-09-03 21:20:02
4244,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_3,Can we stop pointing fingers? We all should've communicated better.,2024-09-03 21:22:02
4245,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,That's easy for you to say when you hardly contributed to the presentation slides!,2024-09-03 21:25:02
4246,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_3,"I was juggling other responsibilities. Unlike some people, I know how to prioritize.",2024-09-03 21:30:02
4247,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,"Hey, both of you need to stop. Arguing isn't going to fix our grade.",2024-09-03 21:37:02
4248,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,"Fine. But next time, how about everyone actually does their part?",2024-09-03 21:45:02
4249,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_3,"Next time, let's set clearer deadlines so we don’t end up like this again.",2024-09-03 21:49:02
4250,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,Agreed. But let's also make sure we review each section together before submitting anything.,2024-09-03 21:58:02
4251,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,Deal. And maybe inform each other if we're too busy to contribute at certain times.,2024-09-03 22:07:02
4252,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_3,"Fine. But we all need to be better about communication, okay?",2024-09-03 22:08:02
4253,escalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,Okay. Let's schedule a meeting with the professor to see if we can do anything to fix this.,2024-09-03 22:14:02
4254,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,You can't be serious. You forgot to file the budget report again?,2024-09-03 20:54:05
4255,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. You know I’ve been swamped with the fundraiser event.",2024-09-03 20:59:05
4256,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,That’s no excuse. We’ve talked about this. Deadlines matter!,2024-09-03 21:00:05
4257,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,And I said I'd get to it. Why are you blowing this out of proportion?,2024-09-03 21:07:05
4258,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,Blowing it out of proportion? You missing deadlines affects all of us!,2024-09-03 21:09:05
4259,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you helped me with the fundraiser, I’d have more time!",2024-09-03 21:19:05
4260,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,"I have my own tasks to handle, you know? It’s called teamwork.",2024-09-03 21:25:05
4261,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,"Teamwork? You’re the one not pulling your weight, acting all high and mighty.",2024-09-03 21:31:05
4262,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,High and mighty? At least I’m responsible enough to meet deadlines!,2024-09-03 21:39:05
4263,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,Responsible? You didn’t even finish your part of the presentation last time!,2024-09-03 21:48:05
4264,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,"That was one time, and I had an emergency! You don’t have that excuse.",2024-09-03 21:54:05
4265,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,"Oh, it’s always something with you. Always pointing fingers, never owning up.",2024-09-03 22:00:05
4266,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,And you just deflect blame. Maybe you’re in over your head.,2024-09-03 22:09:05
4267,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,Maybe you're just impossible to work with!,2024-09-03 22:13:05
4268,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,Fine! Maybe I am! At least I care about my work!,2024-09-03 22:19:05
4269,escalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,Care about your work? You,2024-09-03 22:20:05
4270,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,"I can't believe you double-booked us, Dan! This is a wedding, not a backyard BBQ!",2024-09-03 20:58:07
4271,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Emily. It's not a big deal. We can just reschedule the caterers.",2024-09-03 21:06:07
4272,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,Not a big deal? The wedding is in two weeks! We don't have time to redo everything.,2024-09-03 21:08:07
4273,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_3,"Seriously, Dan. How could you mess this up? We've been planning for months.",2024-09-03 21:17:07
4274,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,"I said I'm sorry, okay? You all act like I did this on purpose.",2024-09-03 21:24:07
4275,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,Sorry doesn't fix the mess we're in. Now we'll have to find new vendors on top of everything else.,2024-09-03 21:30:07
4276,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_4,And what about the guests? They've already RSVP'd for the original date. Now we have to tell everyone the date might change.,2024-09-03 21:33:07
4277,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,You're all blowing this way out of proportion! It's just a mix-up.,2024-09-03 21:35:07
4278,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,A mix-up that could ruin the entire event!,2024-09-03 21:45:07
4279,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_3,"And it's not just the caterers. We need to redo the timeline, the seating, everything!",2024-09-03 21:50:07
4280,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,"Fine, I'll stay up all night and fix it. Happy now?",2024-09-03 21:53:07
4281,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,This isn't just about fixing it—it's about you not taking responsibility in the first place.,2024-09-03 21:59:07
4282,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_4,"You need to understand how much this affects everyone involved, not just you.",2024-09-03 22:07:07
4283,escalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,I'm doing my best here! Why,2024-09-03 22:15:07
4284,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,Why did you leave the door unlocked last night again?,2024-09-03 20:55:10
4285,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! It’s not that big of a deal. Nothing happened, did it?",2024-09-03 20:58:10
4286,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,It is a big deal! Do you know how unsafe that is?,2024-09-03 21:07:10
4287,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,You’re always exaggerating. We haven't had any issues before!,2024-09-03 21:08:10
4288,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. This isn't helping.,2024-09-03 21:15:10
4289,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,"I'm trying to be responsible here, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:16:10
4290,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,Are you saying I’m irresponsible? That’s rich coming from you.,2024-09-03 21:17:10
4291,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_4,Can we please focus on fixing this instead of blaming each other?,2024-09-03 21:27:10
4292,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,"Fine, but something needs to change. We can’t keep ignoring this.",2024-09-03 21:31:10
4293,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,"Okay, tell me your grand plan then, Mr. Responsible.",2024-09-03 21:34:10
4294,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_3,Let’s set up a rule. Whoever leaves last locks the door. Simple.,2024-09-03 21:39:10
4295,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,And what if someone forgets?,2024-09-03 21:43:10
4296,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_4,Maybe we can set reminders on our phones to help us remember.,2024-09-03 21:47:10
4297,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,That sounds like a hassle. Why can’t we just trust each other?,2024-09-03 21:53:10
4298,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,Because trust isn’t enough when safety is at risk.,2024-09-03 22:02:10
4299,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_3,Can we compromise somehow? Maybe a written note left by the door?,2024-09-03 22:05:10
4300,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_4,That could work. As long as everyone commits to it.,2024-09-03 22:13:10
4301,escalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,"Fine, I",2024-09-03 22:22:10
4302,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you submitted the proposal without our approval?,2024-09-03 21:01:13
4303,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,I told you all in the meeting last week! You just weren't paying attention.,2024-09-03 21:05:13
4304,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,"No, you didn't. We specifically agreed to review it together before sending it off.",2024-09-03 21:08:13
4305,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,"Well, I made an executive decision. Someone had to!",2024-09-03 21:17:13
4306,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_3,That's not how this team works! We all have to give our input.,2024-09-03 21:26:13
4307,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,You all are so slow! We would've missed the deadline if I had waited for everyone.,2024-09-03 21:36:13
4308,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_4,But now we have errors in the proposal because no one else reviewed it!,2024-09-03 21:46:13
4309,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,What errors? I didn't see any errors when I submitted it.,2024-09-03 21:51:13
4310,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,Of course you didn't. That's why we needed everyone's eyes on it!,2024-09-03 21:56:13
4311,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,"This is unbelievable. If you don't trust me, then why am I even on this team?",2024-09-03 22:03:13
4312,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_3,It's not about trust. It's about teamwork and making sure our work is the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:10:13
4313,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,Teamwork? You all just want to micromanage everything I do.,2024-09-03 22:13:13
4314,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_4,"That's not true, and you know it. We all have our strengths and need to collaborate.",2024-09-03 22:18:13
4315,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,This conversation is pointless. What's done is done.,2024-09-03 22:25:13
4316,escalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,It's not pointless! We need to figure out a way to fix this mess before it goes any further.,2024-09-03 22:34:13
4317,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,"You can't just decide to change the project without consulting any of us, Alex!",2024-09-03 21:00:16
4318,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're blaming me for trying to improve our work, Mia? That's rich.",2024-09-03 21:03:16
4319,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,Improve? All you've done is add more work and stress for everyone!,2024-09-03 21:10:16
4320,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_3,"Guys, we need to calm down. Let's discuss this rationally.",2024-09-03 21:18:16
4321,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,"Seriously, Jack? Rationally? When Mia's over there making baseless accusations?",2024-09-03 21:21:16
4322,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,"Baseless? You're completely ignoring the deadline, Alex. You never think things through.",2024-09-03 21:24:16
4323,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so focused on just 'getting it done,' we'd actually produce something worthwhile!",2024-09-03 21:29:16
4324,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_3,We can't keep arguing like this. How about we list out all the changes and decide as a team if they are feasible?,2024-09-03 21:39:16
4325,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,"Fine, but Alex needs to learn to collaborate instead of bulldozing everyone's opinions.",2024-09-03 21:48:16
4326,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,And maybe you should learn to be open to new ideas instead of clinging to your safe plans all the time.,2024-09-03 21:51:16
4327,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_3,"Look, we all have valid points. But fighting isn't going to solve anything. Can we focus on what's best for the project?",2024-09-03 22:00:16
4328,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,"I agree, but there needs to be mutual respect. This isn't a solo show.",2024-09-03 22:06:16
4329,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,Respect goes both ways. I want to feel like my ideas matter too.,2024-09-03 22:16:16
4330,escalatory_conversation_294,speaker_3,"Okay, let's start over",2024-09-03 22:25:16
4331,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,Why did you change the design without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:02:19
4332,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,"Because your design was outdated and impractical, that's why!",2024-09-03 21:12:19
4333,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,Outdated? It took me hours to get it just right!,2024-09-03 21:19:19
4334,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,Hours of wasted time then. We need something that actually works!,2024-09-03 21:26:19
4335,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,Who are you to decide that? You're not the team leader!,2024-09-03 21:27:19
4336,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to step up since you're dragging us down.",2024-09-03 21:34:19
4337,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,Dragging us down? I've been putting in more effort than anyone else here!,2024-09-03 21:43:19
4338,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,Effort doesn't mean anything if the results are useless!,2024-09-03 21:46:19
4339,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,What's going on with you two? We're supposed to be working together!,2024-09-03 21:48:19
4340,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,Tell that to Mr. Control Freak over here!,2024-09-03 21:58:19
4341,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,At least I'm trying to keep this project on track!,2024-09-03 22:03:19
4342,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. This isn't helping anyone.,2024-09-03 22:08:19
4343,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,How can I calm down when my work gets trashed without any discussion?,2024-09-03 22:09:19
4344,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,"Maybe if your work was better in the first place, this wouldn't have happened.",2024-09-03 22:12:19
4345,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,"Enough! We need to figure out how to fix this, not point fingers.",2024-09-03 22:22:19
4346,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,Fine. But I'm not letting this slide. We need to talk to the team leader.,2024-09-03 22:26:19
4347,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,Go ahead. I'm sure they'll appreciate knowing who's been holding up progress.,2024-09-03 22:27:19
4348,escalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:33:19
4349,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,Why did you change the project outline without telling anyone?,2024-09-03 21:00:22
4350,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,"Because the old outline had too many flaws, and no one was making any improvements!",2024-09-03 21:03:22
4351,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,That's not your call to make on your own. We should've discussed it as a team.,2024-09-03 21:09:22
4352,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_3,"Wait, you changed the outline? When were you planning to let us know?",2024-09-03 21:10:22
4353,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,"I was planning to tell you all at the meeting, but I figured the changes were obvious improvements.",2024-09-03 21:11:22
4354,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,Obvious to you maybe. Some of those changes don't even make sense for our scope.,2024-09-03 21:15:22
4355,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_3,And now our work is out of sync. I spent hours working on parts that you just scrapped!,2024-09-03 21:19:22
4356,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,"I didn't scrap them, I just modified them. You can still use what you did, just adjust it a bit.",2024-09-03 21:29:22
4357,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,Adjust it? Do you have any idea how much time that will take?,2024-09-03 21:37:22
4358,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_3,This is a team project. You can’t just take over and expect us to be okay with it.,2024-09-03 21:44:22
4359,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,I took initiative because nothing was moving forward! Someone had to do something.,2024-09-03 21:45:22
4360,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,Initiative doesn’t mean solo decisions. We need to collaborate and communicate.,2024-09-03 21:50:22
4361,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_3,And now we're behind schedule. How do you propose we fix this mess?,2024-09-03 21:51:22
4362,escalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,We can work together to make the necessary adjustments. I’m not saying my changes are set,2024-09-03 21:53:22
4363,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,I can't believe you made that decision without consulting anyone.,2024-09-03 20:56:25
4364,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,You weren't around and it needed to be done. What's your problem?,2024-09-03 20:57:25
4365,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,My problem is that you always do this. You never include the rest of us in important decisions.,2024-09-03 21:02:25
4366,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,"Yeah, we’re supposed to be a team. Acting solo isn’t helping.",2024-09-03 21:05:25
4367,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you both gang up on me? Great, just great.",2024-09-03 21:13:25
4368,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,We're not ganging up on you. We just want to understand why you think this is okay.,2024-09-03 21:22:25
4369,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,Maybe because you guys are too slow and we needed action fast!,2024-09-03 21:24:25
4370,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,That's not fair. Speed isn't an excuse for ignoring us.,2024-09-03 21:29:25
4371,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,Exactly. There were other solutions that could have worked better if you'd just asked.,2024-09-03 21:34:25
4372,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"Like what? Seriously, tell me what brilliant ideas you had.",2024-09-03 21:37:25
4373,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,We could've pooled our resources together instead of taking on more debt.,2024-09-03 21:38:25
4374,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,Or negotiated a partnership rather than making a risky purchase.,2024-09-03 21:47:25
4375,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"Well, hindsight is always 20/20. Where were these ideas when I needed them?",2024-09-03 21:50:25
4376,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,We were right here! You just didn’t bother to ask.,2024-09-03 21:53:25
4377,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,It’s this attitude that’s damaging everything.,2024-09-03 22:03:25
4378,escalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I’m the one damaging things? You guys don’t take any responsibility!",2024-09-03 22:09:25
4379,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,"You didn't even try on that group project, did you?",2024-09-03 20:54:28
4380,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, that's not true!",2024-09-03 21:03:28
4381,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,Really? Because your part was a mess.,2024-09-03 21:12:28
4382,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"At least I did something, unlike you just bossing everyone around!",2024-09-03 21:13:28
4383,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_3,"Both of you need to chill. We didn't do well, but fighting isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:19:28
4384,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,Don't tell me to chill. Our grade is tanking because of him!,2024-09-03 21:28:28
4385,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,And whose idea was it to present without proper rehearsal? Yours!,2024-09-03 21:37:28
4386,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_4,You guys are always blaming each other. It's getting old.,2024-09-03 21:44:28
4387,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,"Maybe if you all listened to my plan, we would've succeeded.",2024-09-03 21:49:28
4388,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,Your plan? Your so-called plan didn't include any actual work!,2024-09-03 21:56:28
4389,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_3,"Enough, both of you! We need to find a way to fix this.",2024-09-03 21:58:28
4390,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,"Fine, let's hear your brilliant idea for once.",2024-09-03 22:03:28
4391,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_3,How about we meet with the professor to ask about redoing the project?,2024-09-03 22:10:28
4392,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"Great, now we have to grovel because of his incompetence.",2024-09-03 22:15:28
4393,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_4,At least it's a start. Better than arguing nonstop.,2024-09-03 22:25:28
4394,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,"Fine, whatever. But next time, follow the plan.",2024-09-03 22:26:28
4395,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"Yeah, sure, just have a plan that actually makes sense next time.",2024-09-03 22:29:28
4396,escalatory_conversation_298,speaker_3,Can we please just go to the professor,2024-09-03 22:33:28
4397,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"I can't believe you submitted the code with those bugs, Alex.",2024-09-03 20:56:31
4398,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"I didn't know there were bugs, Sarah. I thought you reviewed it.",2024-09-03 21:02:31
4399,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"Are you serious? I did review it, but I asked you to fix those issues before I gave it a final check.",2024-09-03 21:07:31
4400,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"No, you didn't! You just sent me a message saying it looked fine.",2024-09-03 21:17:31
4401,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"That's because I trusted you to do your part. Obviously, that was a mistake.",2024-09-03 21:27:31
4402,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,My part? I was dealing with the database crash all night. You should have checked more thoroughly!,2024-09-03 21:36:31
4403,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"Maybe if you had communicated about the database crash, I could have helped, instead of you ignoring everything else.",2024-09-03 21:39:31
4404,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it’s my fault for not begging for help? Unbelievable.",2024-09-03 21:42:31
4405,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"It's about teamwork, Alex. We're supposed to be a team! You can't just go solo and ignore deadlines and protocols.",2024-09-03 21:50:31
4406,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"You're talking like you've never missed a deadline. Stop acting righteous, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:51:31
4407,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"Fine, let's ignore the fact that we could lose this client because of incompetence. Happy now?",2024-09-03 22:01:31
4408,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,There you go overreacting again. One bug isn't going to ruin everything.,2024-09-03 22:11:31
4409,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"It's not just one bug, it's a pattern of negligence.",2024-09-03 22:20:31
4410,escalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,Oh really? Maybe if we didn't have to meet your,2024-09-03 22:21:31
4411,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"What were you thinking, Sarah? Late again to practice!",2024-09-03 20:56:35
4412,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, okay? You don't need to jump down my throat, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:05:35
4413,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"We can't keep making exceptions for you, every single practice counts!",2024-09-03 21:08:35
4414,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_3,"Jake's right, Sarah. We've all been busting our butts preparing for the championship.",2024-09-03 21:16:35
4415,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,You think I don't know that? My mom was in the hospital!,2024-09-03 21:21:35
4416,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"We all have lives outside the team, but this is a commitment we all made.",2024-09-03 21:28:35
4417,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,"So what, Jake? I should just ignore my family because of soccer practice?",2024-09-03 21:29:35
4418,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_3,"It's not about ignoring family, Sarah. It's about communication. You could have shot a message.",2024-09-03 21:36:35
4419,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,"How could I think about messages when I'm at the hospital? That's ridiculous, Max.",2024-09-03 21:37:35
4420,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"Look, if you're not serious about this, maybe you shouldn't be on the team.",2024-09-03 21:46:35
4421,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,"Are you threatening to cut me, Jake? After everything I've put into this team?",2024-09-03 21:53:35
4422,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_3,"No one's saying to cut you, Sarah, but Jake's got a point. We need you here.",2024-09-03 22:02:35
4423,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,"I'm here now, aren't I? Ready to practice, but instead, I'm dealing with this nonsense!",2024-09-03 22:04:35
4424,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"This is about the long term, Sarah. We can't afford distractions.",2024-09-03 22:09:35
4425,escalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,So now I'm a distraction,2024-09-03 22:13:35
4426,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,"Why are you always late to our band practice, Alex?",2024-09-03 20:56:38
4427,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Jenny. It's just a few minutes. Don't overreact.",2024-09-03 20:58:38
4428,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,A few minutes? It's always at least 20 minutes. We can't keep starting late every time we practice!,2024-09-03 21:03:38
4429,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"Yeah, but I'm the drummer. You don't even need me for the warm-ups!",2024-09-03 21:06:38
4430,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_3,"Alex, it's not just about warm-ups. It sets a bad example for the rest of us.",2024-09-03 21:07:38
4431,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"Oh great, now you're all ganging up on me. Typical.",2024-09-03 21:10:38
4432,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,We just want to have a productive practice. Is that too much to ask?,2024-09-03 21:13:38
4433,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if we chose better practice times, I wouldn't be late!",2024-09-03 21:14:38
4434,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_3,We've gone over this already. This time works best for everyone else.,2024-09-03 21:23:38
4435,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"Maybe not for everyone, clearly!",2024-09-03 21:32:38
4436,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,"You agreed to this schedule, Alex. If you had a problem, you should've spoken up before!",2024-09-03 21:42:38
4437,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe I will quit. Then you won’t have to worry about me being late.,2024-09-03 21:47:38
4438,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_3,"Now you’re just being dramatic. We need you, but we also need you to be responsible.",2024-09-03 21:49:38
4439,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,Funny how 'responsible' means according to your rules only.,2024-09-03 21:58:38
4440,escalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,"We're a band, not a solo act. We all",2024-09-03 22:01:38
4441,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,You always take my clothes without asking!,2024-09-03 20:54:40
4442,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you didn't hog all the nice ones, I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 20:58:40
4443,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,That's not an excuse. You never respect my stuff.,2024-09-03 20:59:40
4444,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,I don't respect your stuff? What about all the times you borrowed my makeup and never returned it?,2024-09-03 21:01:40
4445,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"That was one time, and I asked! You just assume it's fine to take anything of mine.",2024-09-03 21:03:40
4446,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,"Oh please, you're such a hypocrite. It's like living with a bossy dictator.",2024-09-03 21:10:40
4447,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"If I'm a dictator, it's because you keep breaking rules that should be common sense!",2024-09-03 21:18:40
4448,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,Common sense? More like your personal rules that only benefit you.,2024-09-03 21:22:40
4449,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"Maybe if you actually communicated with me, we wouldn't have these issues!",2024-09-03 21:23:40
4450,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,Why should I bother communicating when you just throw hissy fits over every little thing?,2024-09-03 21:26:40
4451,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,A hissy fit? You're the one who can't handle a simple request to ASK before taking things!,2024-09-03 21:33:40
4452,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,And you're the one who blows up like a volcano over nothing. It's ridiculous.,2024-09-03 21:40:40
4453,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"You know what, I'm done talking to someone who just doesn’t get it.",2024-09-03 21:50:40
4454,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,Fine by me. Maybe I’ll just start locking my stuff up too.,2024-09-03 21:53:40
4455,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"Oh great, like that's going to solve anything. Real mature.",2024-09-03 21:56:40
4456,escalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,At,2024-09-03 21:59:40
4457,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,Why did you change the presentation slides without telling me?,2024-09-03 20:58:43
4458,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,Because your slides were boring and didn't make any sense!,2024-09-03 21:08:43
4459,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,Excuse me? I spent hours working on them. You had no right to just change everything!,2024-09-03 21:11:43
4460,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"No right? I did it because I actually care about our grade, unlike you!",2024-09-03 21:19:43
4461,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,How dare you say I don't care? I've been working just as hard as you!,2024-09-03 21:21:43
4462,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,Oh really? Then why did you put in those outdated statistics? It made us look incompetent!,2024-09-03 21:22:43
4463,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,Maybe I would have used the right stats if you hadn’t monopolized all the research time!,2024-09-03 21:30:43
4464,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"If you knew what you were doing, you wouldn’t need as much time!",2024-09-03 21:31:43
4465,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,"Wow, so now you’re calling me incompetent behind my back?",2024-09-03 21:40:43
4466,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"If that’s what it takes for you to finally get it, then yes!",2024-09-03 21:42:43
4467,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,"This is ridiculous. We were supposed to be a team, not tear each other apart!",2024-09-03 21:52:43
4468,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn’t have to do everything alone if you pulled your weight!,2024-09-03 21:56:43
4469,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,I do pull my weight! You just think you’re the only one who can do things right!,2024-09-03 22:01:43
4470,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"Because you never do anything that shows you're capable, especially with those awful slides!",2024-09-03 22:02:43
4471,escalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,I can’t believe I even agreed to work with you.,2024-09-03 22:03:43
4472,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,Why did you take my laptop without asking?,2024-09-03 20:57:46
4473,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,"I needed it for my project, and you weren't around!",2024-09-03 21:03:46
4474,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,You could have texted me! It's not your laptop to just take.,2024-09-03 21:12:46
4475,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you didn’t lock your room all the time, I wouldn't have to sneak in.",2024-09-03 21:16:46
4476,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,Sneak in? That’s breaking into my space. How am I supposed to trust you now?,2024-09-03 21:18:46
4477,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,"Oh, like you’re so trustworthy? Remember when you borrowed my headphones and ""forgot"" to return them?",2024-09-03 21:23:46
4478,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,That was one time and I apologized! This is completely different.,2024-09-03 21:30:46
4479,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,How is it different? It's the same concept. Borrowing without asking.,2024-09-03 21:34:46
4480,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,The difference is in the duration and the fact that you didn't even try to ask first!,2024-09-03 21:43:46
4481,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,Whatever! You always make a huge deal out of everything I do.,2024-09-03 21:53:46
4482,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,Because you don't respect my boundaries!,2024-09-03 22:03:46
4483,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,Funny coming from you. What about the time you read my journal?,2024-09-03 22:05:46
4484,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,That was an accident and you know it. I thought it was a textbook.,2024-09-03 22:13:46
4485,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,"Sure, it was. Convenient excuse.",2024-09-03 22:17:46
4486,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,Stop deflecting! We're talking about YOUR actions right now.,2024-09-03 22:20:46
4487,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,And what about YOUR actions? You're not exactly a saint here.,2024-09-03 22:29:46
4488,escalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,I'm not,2024-09-03 22:30:46
4489,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,"Why did you take my headphones without asking, Sam?",2024-09-03 20:57:49
4490,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,"Oh come on, Jake. It's just a pair of headphones. What's the big deal?",2024-09-03 21:01:49
4491,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,The big deal is that they're mine and you didn't ask me!,2024-09-03 21:02:49
4492,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,"Well, you weren't using them and I needed them. Can we just drop it?",2024-09-03 21:09:49
4493,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,"No, we can't just drop it! You always do this. You never respect my stuff.",2024-09-03 21:12:49
4494,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,That's not true! I respect your stuff when you're being reasonable.,2024-09-03 21:16:49
4495,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,Oh really? How reasonable is it to just take things without permission?,2024-09-03 21:18:49
4496,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,It's not like you weren't going to get them back.,2024-09-03 21:25:49
4497,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,"That's not the point, Sam! The point is you didn't bother to ask!",2024-09-03 21:26:49
4498,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,"Because I knew you'd make a huge deal out of it, like you're doing now!",2024-09-03 21:28:49
4499,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if you respected my things, I wouldn't have to make a big deal out of it!",2024-09-03 21:29:49
4500,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,"You know what? Maybe if you were less uptight, this wouldn't even be an issue!",2024-09-03 21:36:49
4501,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,"Wow, okay. So now it's my fault for wanting a little respect for my belongings?",2024-09-03 21:43:49
4502,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,You always need everything to go your way. It's exhausting!,2024-09-03 21:53:49
4503,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,And you never think about anyone but yourself. It's infuriating!,2024-09-03 21:58:49
4504,escalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:08:49
4505,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"You know, you really didn't have to shut down my idea in front of everyone in the meeting.",2024-09-03 20:54:52
4506,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break! Your idea was impractical and would have cost us too much.",2024-09-03 21:00:52
4507,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"It's not about whether you agree, it's about how you completely dismissed it without giving it a fair chance.",2024-09-03 21:02:52
4508,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually did your homework, your ideas would be worth considering!",2024-09-03 21:05:52
4509,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who never prepares for meetings and wings it every single time.,2024-09-03 21:06:52
4510,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"At least I can think on my feet. Unlike you, who needs everything planned down to the last detail.",2024-09-03 21:08:52
4511,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"Planning is what keeps us from making costly mistakes, which you seem to have no problem with!",2024-09-03 21:18:52
4512,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,Costly mistakes? Says the person who wasted our budget on that failed campaign last quarter.,2024-09-03 21:26:52
4513,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"Don't you dare bring that up. We all agreed on that campaign, including you!",2024-09-03 21:32:52
4514,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"Yeah, because YOU convinced everyone it would work. It was your idea, remember?",2024-09-03 21:39:52
4515,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,At least I take responsibility for my ideas. You just blame others when things go wrong.,2024-09-03 21:46:52
4516,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,Responsibility? Ha! That's a joke. You never admit when you're wrong.,2024-09-03 21:49:52
4517,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"I can't believe you! You think you're so much better, but you contribute nothing of value.",2024-09-03 21:51:52
4518,escalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,If you hate my input so,2024-09-03 21:59:52
4519,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,Why did you take the last slice of pizza without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 20:54:55
4520,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,"I was hungry, what difference does it make?",2024-09-03 20:57:55
4521,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,The difference is you didn't think about anyone else. We all wanted a piece.,2024-09-03 21:01:55
4522,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_3,"Yeah, I've been looking forward to that all day!",2024-09-03 21:03:55
4523,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,"Well, there wasn’t enough for everyone anyway. It’s not like it would have been fair.",2024-09-03 21:13:55
4524,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,"That's not the point, you should have at least asked.",2024-09-03 21:23:55
4525,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_3,"Exactly, we could've shared it or figured something out.",2024-09-03 21:29:55
4526,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,You two are blowing this way out of proportion. It’s just a pizza slice!,2024-09-03 21:39:55
4527,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,It’s about consideration and respect for others.,2024-09-03 21:44:55
4528,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_3,You always do things like this without thinking about us!,2024-09-03 21:46:55
4529,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I’m selfish all the time? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:56:55
4530,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,We’re just saying you need to consider the group more.,2024-09-03 22:03:55
4531,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_3,"Yeah, it’s not just about you.",2024-09-03 22:08:55
4532,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,"I can't believe we're fighting over this. If it's such a big deal, I'll buy another pizza!",2024-09-03 22:18:55
4533,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,It's not just about replacing it. It's about changing your attitude.,2024-09-03 22:24:55
4534,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_3,We need to feel like you care about our feelings too.,2024-09-03 22:27:55
4535,escalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,"Fine, I get it. I'm sorry, okay? I'll try to be more considerate next",2024-09-03 22:33:55
4536,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design without asking, Mia?",2024-09-03 20:59:58
4537,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,"I had to finish the project, Alex! You were dragging your feet.",2024-09-03 21:04:58
4538,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,Dragging my feet? I was perfecting it! That design was far from finished.,2024-09-03 21:13:58
4539,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,Perfecting it? We were out of time! You always do this—overthink everything and miss deadlines.,2024-09-03 21:21:58
4540,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault we have tight deadlines? You don't respect the work that goes into this, do you?",2024-09-03 21:29:58
4541,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,Respect the work? How about respecting the team’s needs for a change? It’s not all about you!,2024-09-03 21:37:58
4542,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,"If you think cutting corners is teamwork, then maybe you shouldn't be leading this project!",2024-09-03 21:40:58
4543,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,"Maybe I shouldn't? If I weren't leading, we'd probably still be on phase one!",2024-09-03 21:43:58
4544,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,At least phase one would be done correctly instead of half-baked like everything you rush out.,2024-09-03 21:52:58
4545,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,Half-baked? My rushed work won us the last two contracts while your “perfected” designs sat unfinished.,2024-09-03 22:02:58
4546,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,"So what, we’re sacrificing quality for quantity now? Is that your big strategy?",2024-09-03 22:09:58
4547,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,It's called meeting client needs! Something you'd understand if you stopped nitpicking for five seconds.,2024-09-03 22:14:58
4548,escalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,I’d rather nitpick than deliver trash! You don't get the essence of good design at all.,2024-09-03 22:22:58
4549,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,"I can't believe you missed that shot, again!",2024-09-03 20:59:01
4550,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Oh, and like you could have done any better?",2024-09-03 21:09:01
4551,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,Both of you need to focus. We're losing because no one's playing like a team.,2024-09-03 21:17:01
4552,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,Don't pretend like you haven't been making mistakes too.,2024-09-03 21:20:01
4553,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Yeah, every pass you make is practically an invitation for the other team.",2024-09-03 21:27:01
4554,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,"At least I'm trying to set something up, unlike certain people who just hog the ball.",2024-09-03 21:36:01
4555,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Great teamwork, guys.",2024-09-03 21:46:01
4556,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Maybe if we had better coordination, but we can't even agree on basic plays.",2024-09-03 21:51:01
4557,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,"Or maybe if you showed up to practice more often, we'd be more synchronized!",2024-09-03 22:01:01
4558,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,"Enough with the excuses and finger-pointing, we have a game to win here.",2024-09-03 22:10:01
4559,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Funny coming from you, the king of excuses.",2024-09-03 22:19:01
4560,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,And what about you constantly complaining on the court?,2024-09-03 22:25:01
4561,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,Can we please just get our act together and stop this endless blame game?,2024-09-03 22:26:01
4562,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,I'm not taking advice from someone who can't even catch a pass.,2024-09-03 22:30:01
4563,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,"Well, look who's talking. Maybe if you passed the ball once in a while—",2024-09-03 22:39:01
4564,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,That's it! I'm done arguing. Either we play as a team or we don't play at all.,2024-09-03 22:44:01
4565,escalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Fine, but don't",2024-09-03 22:52:01
4566,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball during that last play!,2024-09-03 20:59:04
4567,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,Are you serious? You weren't even in a good position!,2024-09-03 21:03:04
4568,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_3,"Guys, stop it. We need to focus on the next quarter.",2024-09-03 21:04:04
4569,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,"No, this is important! If I had gotten that pass, we would've scored and tied the game!",2024-09-03 21:10:04
4570,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,You're always blaming me when things go wrong. Maybe you should work on getting open better!,2024-09-03 21:16:04
4571,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,I was wide open! You just didn't look up!,2024-09-03 21:17:04
4572,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,Don't put this all on me. You've missed your fair share of shots today.,2024-09-03 21:19:04
4573,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_3,Can we just focus on playing as a team for once?,2024-09-03 21:20:04
4574,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,How can we play as a team when some people won't even pass the ball?,2024-09-03 21:30:04
4575,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,Maybe the problem isn't the passing but your attitude.,2024-09-03 21:38:04
4576,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,My attitude? I'm not the one hogging the ball!,2024-09-03 21:40:04
4577,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,And I'm not the one making excuses for my own poor performance!,2024-09-03 21:47:04
4578,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_3,This arguing is pointless. We're supposed to figure out how to turn this game around.,2024-09-03 21:53:04
4579,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,"Fine, but don't think this conversation is over.",2024-09-03 21:58:04
4580,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,"Oh, trust me, I won't forget this either.",2024-09-03 21:59:04
4581,escalatory_conversation_310,speaker_3,"Great, now that we've settled that, can we at least try to work together for the rest of the game?",2024-09-03 22:00:04
4582,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,I can't believe you just took my design idea and claimed it as your own!,2024-09-03 20:54:07
4583,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,"What are you talking about? I didn't take anything. We were brainstorming, and ideas belong to the team.",2024-09-03 20:59:07
4584,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,"No, this was my specific design! I showed you my sketches last week!",2024-09-03 21:08:07
4585,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,"Well, if you didn't want it used, why share it during the team meeting?",2024-09-03 21:13:07
4586,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_3,"Hey, let's all calm down. Maybe there's a way to—",2024-09-03 21:20:07
4587,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,"Don't tell me to calm down. I put hours into that concept, and now it's presented as if it's your brainchild.",2024-09-03 21:24:07
4588,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,"Oh please, as if any of your ideas have ever worked out. I made it better!",2024-09-03 21:27:07
4589,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,That's not the point! It's about credit where credit is due. You can't just steal someone's work!,2024-09-03 21:32:07
4590,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,"Steal? Don't be so dramatic. It’s a cooperative project, grow up!",2024-09-03 21:33:07
4591,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_3,"Okay, this isn't helping. Let's—",2024-09-03 21:40:07
4592,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,That's easy for you to say. It's not your work that got stolen!,2024-09-03 21:45:07
4593,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,"You need to learn to work as part of a team, not throw tantrums every time things don’t go your way.",2024-09-03 21:49:07
4594,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,Maybe you need to learn what integrity means! How can I trust you if you're just going to take my work and pass it off as yours?,2024-09-03 21:56:07
4595,escalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,Trust?,2024-09-03 22:05:07
4596,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were skipping today's rehearsal?,2024-09-03 21:00:10
4597,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,Because I knew you'd overreact like you always do.,2024-09-03 21:02:10
4598,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,Overreact? Do you realize how important this performance is for all of us?,2024-09-03 21:07:10
4599,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"Yes, but maybe I have a life outside this play, unlike you!",2024-09-03 21:14:10
4600,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,"Oh, right, because being committed is such a bad thing.",2024-09-03 21:23:10
4601,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,It's not about commitment; it's about your control freak attitude!,2024-09-03 21:26:10
4602,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,"Maybe if you didn't flake out so often, I wouldn't have to be!",2024-09-03 21:30:10
4603,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,I'm not flaking out. I had something important come up!,2024-09-03 21:31:10
4604,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,More important than the months of work we've all put in?,2024-09-03 21:40:10
4605,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"Yes, sometimes things outside your precious play can be more important.",2024-09-03 21:48:10
4606,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,You knew today was a crucial rehearsal. We had to finalize the choreography.,2024-09-03 21:56:10
4607,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,And I had a family emergency. Sorry if that's not good enough for you.,2024-09-03 22:03:10
4608,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,You could've at least told us. We all were waiting for you.,2024-09-03 22:07:10
4609,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"I didn't have time to think about texting everyone, especially you.",2024-09-03 22:08:10
4610,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,Fine. But don't expect any sympathy when you mess up on stage.,2024-09-03 22:16:10
4611,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"Oh, don't worry. I won't need any support from you.",2024-09-03 22:24:10
4612,escalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,"That's right, because you'd never admit you need help from anyone.",2024-09-03 22:34:10
4613,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,I can't believe you gave my presentation notes to the boss without asking me first!,2024-09-03 21:02:12
4614,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"What was I supposed to do? You weren't around, and it was urgent!",2024-09-03 21:06:12
4615,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,That's not an excuse! You knew I was working on those notes for weeks.,2024-09-03 21:12:12
4616,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you were more organized, I wouldn't have had to.",2024-09-03 21:16:12
4617,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,Are you seriously blaming me for your lack of consideration?,2024-09-03 21:19:12
4618,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"I'm just saying, it's a team effort, and you can't expect to own everything.",2024-09-03 21:22:12
4619,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,Team effort? Then why didn't you at least let me know what you were doing?,2024-09-03 21:28:12
4620,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,Because there was no time! Do you want us to miss the deadline because of your ego?,2024-09-03 21:34:12
4621,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,"My ego? This is about respect and communication, which you obviously lack.",2024-09-03 21:42:12
4622,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,Respect? How about you respect the fact that we're all trying to get this project done on time?,2024-09-03 21:52:12
4623,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who can't handle a simple courtesy of informing a teammate.,2024-09-03 21:57:12
4624,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"Look, I'm doing what needs to be done. If you can't handle that, maybe you shouldn't be on this project.",2024-09-03 21:59:12
4625,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,"Maybe I shouldn't, if it means dealing with your constant undermining.",2024-09-03 22:04:12
4626,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"Undermining? I'm covering for you, not that you'd ever admit it.",2024-09-03 22:13:12
4627,escalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,Covering for me? You're just trying,2024-09-03 22:21:12
4628,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,How could you seriously leave the store without paying for that shirt?,2024-09-03 20:54:15
4629,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,"It was just a mistake! I thought I did, but I was distracted!",2024-09-03 20:56:15
4630,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,"Distracted? You have to be kidding me. This isn't the first time, you know.",2024-09-03 21:06:15
4631,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're keeping track? What about the time you almost got us banned from that restaurant?",2024-09-03 21:08:15
4632,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,That was totally different! At least I didn't steal anything!,2024-09-03 21:17:15
4633,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,Stop calling me a thief! I'm not a criminal!,2024-09-03 21:23:15
4634,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,Then stop acting like one! I don't need this kind of trouble in my life.,2024-09-03 21:32:15
4635,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,Maybe I don't need someone who's constantly judging me!,2024-09-03 21:36:15
4636,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,"Fine, if you can't even admit when you're in the wrong, maybe we shouldn't hang out anymore.",2024-09-03 21:40:15
4637,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,Maybe we shouldn't! I'm tired of walking on eggshells with you anyway.,2024-09-03 21:47:15
4638,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,Good luck finding someone else who'll put up with your nonsense.,2024-09-03 21:56:15
4639,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,And good luck finding someone who'll tolerate your constant criticism.,2024-09-03 21:58:15
4640,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,"Don't worry, I will. And they'll actually be responsible.",2024-09-03 22:01:15
4641,escalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,Whatever. I'm out of here.,2024-09-03 22:06:15
4642,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,You borrowed my laptop again without asking!,2024-09-03 20:59:18
4643,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,I just needed it for a few minutes to finish my report.,2024-09-03 21:05:18
4644,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,That’s not the point! You always take my stuff without permission.,2024-09-03 21:11:18
4645,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you were around more often, I wouldn’t have to!",2024-09-03 21:13:18
4646,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,So now it's my fault you can’t communicate properly?,2024-09-03 21:17:18
4647,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,"At least I’m doing something productive, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:26:18
4648,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,Are you calling me lazy now?,2024-09-03 21:34:18
4649,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,If the shoe fits.,2024-09-03 21:37:18
4650,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,"This isn’t about me being lazy, it’s about you respecting boundaries!",2024-09-03 21:46:18
4651,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,Your boundaries are ridiculous and unrealistic.,2024-09-03 21:48:18
4652,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,They wouldn’t be if you had any sense of responsibility or sharing!,2024-09-03 21:51:18
4653,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,Sharing? You wouldn’t know sharing if it hit you in the face.,2024-09-03 21:59:18
4654,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,"Fine, if that's how you feel, I’ll just start locking my door.",2024-09-03 22:08:18
4655,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,Go ahead! It’s not like you’re ever around anyway.,2024-09-03 22:10:18
4656,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,Maybe I’m not around because you’re so impossible to live with!,2024-09-03 22:15:18
4657,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,"Great, blame me for your issues. Typical.",2024-09-03 22:20:18
4658,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,"It’s always everyone's fault but yours, isn't it?",2024-09-03 22:27:18
4659,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,"Look, just stay out of my way and I’ll stay out of yours.",2024-09-03 22:32:18
4660,escalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,"Oh, I fully intend to.",2024-09-03 22:33:18
4661,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up to the team meeting, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:00:22
4662,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"I had something come up, Mark. I don't need to explain myself every time.",2024-09-03 21:03:22
4663,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"Actually, you do. We're supposed to be working on this project together, remember?",2024-09-03 21:10:22
4664,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_3,Can we all just calm down? This isn't helping us finish the project.,2024-09-03 21:12:22
4665,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"No, I'm not calming down. Sarah's been skipping out on her responsibilities for weeks now.",2024-09-03 21:15:22
4666,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"That's not true, and you know it. Stop exaggerating.",2024-09-03 21:23:22
4667,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_3,"Mark, Sarah, please. We're running out of time. We need to focus.",2024-09-03 21:33:22
4668,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,Focus? How can we focus when one of us isn't even present? It's not fair for everyone else.,2024-09-03 21:40:22
4669,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"I've been doing my part, and you know it. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not happening.",2024-09-03 21:41:22
4670,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"Oh, really? Then where are the designs you promised?",2024-09-03 21:42:22
4671,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,They're almost done. I just need a bit more time.,2024-09-03 21:46:22
4672,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"""Almost"" isn't good enough. We have deadlines, Sarah!",2024-09-03 21:52:22
4673,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_3,"Please, Mark. Can we give Sarah a chance to explain?",2024-09-03 21:58:22
4674,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"I'm not sure why you're defending her, Emma. This affects all of us.",2024-09-03 22:06:22
4675,escalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"I don't need defending. And for the record, I've had personal issues to deal with.",2024-09-03 22:12:22
4676,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the project deadline extension? I found out from Mark this morning.,2024-09-03 20:58:25
4677,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was important to inform you; besides, you always miss these updates anyway.",2024-09-03 20:59:25
4678,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,How can you say that? I always keep up with our team emails. It's your responsibility to communicate.,2024-09-03 21:06:25
4679,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,My responsibility? You're just trying to blame someone because you procrastinated again.,2024-09-03 21:08:25
4680,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. We need to focus on getting this project done, not pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 21:12:25
4681,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,"No, because every time this happens, it’s always swept under the rug. I'm tired of picking up the slack.",2024-09-03 21:20:25
4682,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,"Oh please, you act like you're the only one who does any work around here. Everyone knows you overestimate your contribution.",2024-09-03 21:30:25
4683,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who couldn't even remember to email the client last week.,2024-09-03 21:31:25
4684,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,At least I didn't screw up the presentation slides and make us look unprofessional.,2024-09-03 21:35:25
4685,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_3,Can we stop with the insults and figure out how to work together? We’re supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 21:40:25
4686,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,It's hard to be a team when one of us doesn’t communicate and the other one doesn’t care about deadlines.,2024-09-03 21:41:25
4687,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,And it's hard to be a team when someone constantly plays the victim and exaggerates what they do.,2024-09-03 21:43:25
4688,escalatory_conversation_317,speaker_3,"Seriously, we're not going to meet any deadlines",2024-09-03 21:48:25
4689,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,Why did you use my laptop without asking?,2024-09-03 20:55:28
4690,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,"I needed to finish my project, and yours was the only one available.",2024-09-03 21:04:28
4691,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,You could have at least asked first. It's not yours to use whenever you feel like it.,2024-09-03 21:13:28
4692,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,It's not that big of a deal. You weren't even using it.,2024-09-03 21:18:28
4693,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,That's not the point! It's about respect and boundaries.,2024-09-03 21:28:28
4694,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,You're overreacting. It was just a quick thing. I didn't mess anything up.,2024-09-03 21:31:28
4695,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,How do I know that? You left files open and now I’m worried something might be missing or altered.,2024-09-03 21:40:28
4696,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,Seriously? I’m not an idiot. I know how to use a computer without deleting your stuff.,2024-09-03 21:45:28
4697,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,That's not the issue! The issue is you didn't respect my property.,2024-09-03 21:48:28
4698,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,"Since when did we start getting all territorial? We're roommates, we share things.",2024-09-03 21:53:28
4699,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,Sharing requires asking permission first. Not doing whatever you want whenever you want.,2024-09-03 21:56:28
4700,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,"Fine, next time I’ll ask. Are we done here?",2024-09-03 22:03:28
4701,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,"No, we’re not. What you did shows a lack of consideration for me, and that’s what bothers me the most.",2024-09-03 22:05:28
4702,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It was a one-time thing.",2024-09-03 22:15:28
4703,escalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,This isn’t the,2024-09-03 22:21:28
4704,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"You can't just show up late to these band rehearsals, Alex. It's disrespectful to everyone else.",2024-09-03 20:59:31
4705,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again. It's not like I'm the only one who's ever been late, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:09:31
4706,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_3,"Guys, we need to focus on our upcoming gig, not argue about timing.",2024-09-03 21:13:31
4707,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"No, it is important! We've been planning this for months. We can't afford to slack off now!",2024-09-03 21:19:31
4708,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't such a control freak, we'd actually have some fun doing this.",2024-09-03 21:28:31
4709,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_4,Can we just calm down? Pointing fingers isn't going to help us sound better.,2024-09-03 21:34:31
4710,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"I'm not a control freak. I just care about our success. Maybe if everyone cared as much, we'd be in a better spot!",2024-09-03 21:38:31
4711,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"Oh please, Sarah. Don't act like you're the only one who cares. We all want to do well.",2024-09-03 21:39:31
4712,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_3,"Alex, can't you just admit that being late isn't helping anyone?",2024-09-03 21:40:31
4713,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"Fine, I was late. But it's not like it ruined everything. We can still pull this off if we stop wasting time arguing.",2024-09-03 21:47:31
4714,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,Wasting time? You're the one who wasted our time by being late!,2024-09-03 21:54:31
4715,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_4,Enough! How about we all agree to do better from now on?,2024-09-03 21:59:31
4716,escalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you're never the one getting called out.",2024-09-03 22:03:31
4717,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took credit for my design during the team meeting, Mark.",2024-09-03 20:58:34
4718,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again, Emily. Maybe if you spoke up more often, you wouldn’t need me to back you up.",2024-09-03 20:59:34
4719,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,Back me up? You completely overshadowed me and made it sound like it was all your idea!,2024-09-03 21:07:34
4720,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to step up. You were fumbling through your presentation notes.",2024-09-03 21:14:34
4721,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_3,"Guys, stop it. We need to focus on getting this project done, not arguing about who takes the credit.",2024-09-03 21:20:34
4722,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Karen. You're not the one being undermined at every turn.",2024-09-03 21:28:34
4723,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_3,I'm just saying this bickering isn't helping anyone.,2024-09-03 21:37:34
4724,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,Maybe we should focus more on getting things right than on who’s crying over stolen thunder.,2024-09-03 21:41:34
4725,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,"Stolen thunder? My work deserves recognition, just like everyone else's!",2024-09-03 21:46:34
4726,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_3,This is getting out of hand. We have a deadline to meet.,2024-09-03 21:47:34
4727,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"Yeah, well, some of us are more concerned about meeting it than crying over spilled milk.",2024-09-03 21:55:34
4728,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,"It's not spilled milk, it's about respect and integrity!",2024-09-03 22:04:34
4729,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_3,Can we please just get back to work and talk about this later?,2024-09-03 22:07:34
4730,escalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"Typical Karen, trying to be the peacemaker. We've got issues that need resolving now.",2024-09-03 22:17:34
4731,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted the proposal without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 20:54:38
4732,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal since we already discussed the main points.,2024-09-03 20:55:38
4733,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,Not a big deal? You changed half the content and didn't even bother to tell me!,2024-09-03 20:59:38
4734,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"Well, I didn't want to waste your time with minor details. I thought you'd appreciate that.",2024-09-03 21:00:38
4735,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,It's not about wasting time; it's about respecting our collaboration. You completely ignored my input.,2024-09-03 21:01:38
4736,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"Maybe if your input wasn't so outdated, I wouldn't have had to make those changes.",2024-09-03 21:02:38
4737,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,Outdated? My ideas are what have kept this project running smoothly.,2024-09-03 21:04:38
4738,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"Smoothly? More like stagnating. We needed fresh ideas, and you were holding us back.",2024-09-03 21:13:38
4739,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,"Holding us back? All this time, I've been the one pushing this project forward.",2024-09-03 21:16:38
4740,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"And yet, here we are, stuck in the same place because you refuse to adapt.",2024-09-03 21:22:38
4741,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,Refuse to adapt? I'm the one who brought in the original vision for this project!,2024-09-03 21:24:38
4742,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"And that vision was fine—five years ago. Times change, and we need to change with them.",2024-09-03 21:29:38
4743,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,So your solution is to just ditch everything we've built and start over?,2024-09-03 21:35:38
4744,escalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"Not start over, innovate. There's a difference, but you wouldn't understand.",2024-09-03 21:40:38
4745,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you tell me about the meeting with the investors, David?",2024-09-03 20:57:41
4746,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,"I didn’t think it was necessary for you to be there, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:06:41
4747,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,But I’m the co-founder! How did you not think it was necessary?,2024-09-03 21:10:41
4748,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,Because you always derail the conversation with your unnecessary details!,2024-09-03 21:11:41
4749,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"Oh, so I’m the problem now? Maybe if you gave clearer presentations, I wouldn’t have to step in!",2024-09-03 21:15:41
4750,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,My presentations are fine! You just can't stand not being the center of attention.,2024-09-03 21:23:41
4751,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,That's ridiculous! You're just trying to cover up your own inadequacies by blaming me.,2024-09-03 21:29:41
4752,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,Inadequacies? You mean like the time you forgot to send our pitch deck and cost us that deal?,2024-09-03 21:32:41
4753,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"Oh, bring that up again! At least I didn’t try to close a deal without even considering our margins!",2024-09-03 21:42:41
4754,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,Someone has to be practical around here since you clearly prefer fantasy over reality.,2024-09-03 21:47:41
4755,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,Fantasy? You wouldn't even have investors to present to if it wasn't for my vision!,2024-09-03 21:53:41
4756,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,"Yeah, well, visions don't pay the bills, Sarah. Hard work does.",2024-09-03 22:02:41
4757,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"Are you implying I don’t work hard? I put in just as much, if not more, effort than you!",2024-09-03 22:05:41
4758,escalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,"Well, your effort isn't exactly showing results, is it?",2024-09-03 22:07:41
4759,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,I can't believe you took the lead role without even telling me!,2024-09-03 20:55:44
4760,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,"I earned that role, fair and square. Don't act like you had any claim to it.",2024-09-03 20:56:44
4761,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,You know how much this play means to me. You could have at least talked to me about it!,2024-09-03 21:05:44
4762,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I need your permission to pursue opportunities? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:07:44
4763,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,"It's not about permission, it's about respect! You didn't even give me a chance.",2024-09-03 21:11:44
4764,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,Maybe because you always assume you'll get the spotlight. Newsflash: you're not the only talented one here.,2024-09-03 21:14:44
4765,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,"That's not fair, and you know it. I've worked just as hard, if not harder, for this.",2024-09-03 21:20:44
4766,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,And you think I haven't? Stop playing the victim.,2024-09-03 21:23:44
4767,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,I'm not playing the victim. I'm pointing out that you went behind my back!,2024-09-03 21:30:44
4768,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,Behind your back? Are you even listening to yourself? This isn't some conspiracy against you.,2024-09-03 21:32:44
4769,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,Whatever. I guess that's the kind of friend you are.,2024-09-03 21:39:44
4770,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,Don't you dare question my friendship. You're the one acting like a spoiled brat.,2024-09-03 21:40:44
4771,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,Maybe I wouldn't have to if you'd show a little loyalty.,2024-09-03 21:43:44
4772,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,Loyalty? To someone who can't even be happy for their friend's success?,2024-09-03 21:44:44
4773,escalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,I could be happy if I wasn't blindsided by it,2024-09-03 21:48:44
4774,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,"Why didn't you prepare the data for the presentation, Mark? We had a week!",2024-09-03 20:57:47
4775,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,"I told you, Sarah, I was busy with the client proposal. You knew that!",2024-09-03 21:02:47
4776,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,A week should've been plenty of time to handle both. This was crucial for our pitch!,2024-09-03 21:03:47
4777,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,And so was the client proposal! Why are you acting like I did nothing?,2024-09-03 21:10:47
4778,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,Because you prioritized the wrong task! Now we look unprepared!,2024-09-03 21:15:47
4779,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's all on me, is it? What about your part? Did you even verify the stats I sent before the meeting?",2024-09-03 21:22:47
4780,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,My part was flawless until it was undermined by your missing data!,2024-09-03 21:27:47
4781,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,"That’s convenient. Always laying the blame on someone else, aren’t you?",2024-09-03 21:29:47
4782,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,"You know what, Mark? This isn't the first time you've dropped the ball. This project is just another example.",2024-09-03 21:31:47
4783,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,"Really, Sarah? At least I’m not the one who messes up the projections every single time.",2024-09-03 21:39:47
4784,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,Messes up the projections? When have I ever done that?,2024-09-03 21:46:47
4785,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,"Last quarter, remember? We had to pull an all-nighter to fix the numbers you provided.",2024-09-03 21:50:47
4786,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,"That was a miscommunication, and we fixed it together. This is different.",2024-09-03 22:00:47
4787,escalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,Seems to me you've got selective memory when it suits,2024-09-03 22:01:47
4788,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,I can’t believe you went behind my back and changed the project without consulting me.,2024-09-03 21:02:49
4789,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,What are you talking about? It was a minor adjustment; you were overcomplicating things.,2024-09-03 21:03:49
4790,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,Minor adjustment? You basically rewrote the entire proposal!,2024-09-03 21:12:49
4791,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,"Because your version was going to fail, and you know it!",2024-09-03 21:22:49
4792,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_3,"Everyone, calm down. We need to get this project done, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:29:49
4793,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you didn’t spend hours on that draft.",2024-09-03 21:32:49
4794,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,"And my changes actually made it better, unlike your convoluted mess.",2024-09-03 21:36:49
4795,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,"How dare you! My work wasn’t a mess, it was detailed!",2024-09-03 21:44:49
4796,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop! We’re not getting anywhere like this.",2024-09-03 21:46:49
4797,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,"Fine, but this isn’t over. We need a mediator if we’re going to continue working together.",2024-09-03 21:56:49
4798,escalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,"Agreed, because clearly we can’t see eye to eye on anything.",2024-09-03 22:04:49
4799,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"I can't believe you missed that shot again, Sarah.",2024-09-03 20:59:52
4800,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"Seriously, Jake? You're really going to pin this whole loss on me?",2024-09-03 21:06:52
4801,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if you practiced more, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:16:52
4802,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_3,"Jake, stop it. We all made mistakes today.",2024-09-03 21:25:52
4803,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"No, Tim. Sarah's missed shots were the worst. She cost us the game!",2024-09-03 21:34:52
4804,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all on me? What about your turnovers, Jake? You're not exactly perfect out there.",2024-09-03 21:41:52
4805,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"At least I put in the effort! You just stand there, looking lost.",2024-09-03 21:51:52
4806,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_3,This isn't helping. Blaming each other won't change the outcome.,2024-09-03 21:59:52
4807,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"Exactly. We need to figure out how to work better as a team, not tear each other down.",2024-09-03 22:04:52
4808,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Tim. You're not the one getting singled out.",2024-09-03 22:06:52
4809,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_3,I'm trying to keep us focused on improving. This pettiness won't help us win next time.,2024-09-03 22:15:52
4810,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"Maybe if we all supported each other more, we'd perform better.",2024-09-03 22:18:52
4811,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,How can I support someone who doesn't even try?,2024-09-03 22:25:52
4812,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,I do try! Just because I had a bad game doesn't mean I don't care.,2024-09-03 22:33:52
4813,escalatory_conversation_326,speaker_3,We all care. That's why we're frustrated. But this isn't the way to deal with it.,2024-09-03 22:34:52
4814,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,I can't believe you went to Mr. Taylor about our project without telling me!,2024-09-03 21:01:55
4815,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,"Because you weren't doing your part, Sarah. I had to.",2024-09-03 21:07:55
4816,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,Not doing my part? I've been pulling all-nighters to finish the research!,2024-09-03 21:13:55
4817,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,Really? Then where's the data analysis? We're a week behind because of you.,2024-09-03 21:21:55
4818,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,"Are you serious? I asked you for the data two weeks ago, and you still haven't given it to me!",2024-09-03 21:26:55
4819,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,Stop making excuses. You could have started with the raw data I provided.,2024-09-03 21:32:55
4820,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,"Oh, right, the incomplete, messy spreadsheet you sent me. How was I supposed to work with that?",2024-09-03 21:35:55
4821,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,"That's your job, Sarah. Why do I have to clean up everything for you?",2024-09-03 21:36:55
4822,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,"My job? It's called teamwork, Alex, and we're supposed to support each other, not blame each other when things go wrong.",2024-09-03 21:41:55
4823,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,Teamwork? That's rich coming from someone who can't meet a basic deadline.,2024-09-03 21:47:55
4824,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,At least I communicate! You just hide away and avoid responsibility altogether.,2024-09-03 21:54:55
4825,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,I avoid responsibility? I'm the one who had to report our progress to Mr. Taylor because you kept delaying!,2024-09-03 22:00:55
4826,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,You went behind my back because you can't handle confrontation.,2024-09-03 22:05:55
4827,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,And you're acting like a child because you can't handle constructive criticism.,2024-09-03 22:11:55
4828,escalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,,2024-09-03 22:14:55
4829,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design and present it as your own, Rachel?",2024-09-03 21:02:59
4830,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Tom? It's a group project. We all contributed!",2024-09-03 21:11:59
4831,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,"Yeah, but I worked all night on that specific design. You didn't even give me credit.",2024-09-03 21:21:59
4832,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_3,"Okay, everybody calm down. Maybe there was a misunderstanding.",2024-09-03 21:28:59
4833,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,"There's no misunderstanding, Jake. She deliberately took my idea.",2024-09-03 21:34:59
4834,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,"I didn't take anything, Tom! We were supposed to share ideas and build on them together.",2024-09-03 21:40:59
4835,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,Sharing ideas doesn't mean stealing someone's hard work and calling it your own!,2024-09-03 21:42:59
4836,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_3,"Rachel, did you really not know that was Tom's design?",2024-09-03 21:44:59
4837,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,I thought we were supposed to collaborate. Isn't that what we agreed on?,2024-09-03 21:49:59
4838,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,Collaboration doesn't mean presenting someone else's key work without acknowledgment.,2024-09-03 21:55:59
4839,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_3,"Look, let's try to think constructively. How can we fix this going forward?",2024-09-03 22:01:59
4840,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,"Fine, I'll make sure to credit every little thing next time. Happy?",2024-09-03 22:03:59
4841,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,It's not about making me happy. It's about basic respect and integrity.,2024-09-03 22:09:59
4842,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_3,"Seriously, guys, we need to regroup. This project's deadline is approaching.",2024-09-03 22:14:59
4843,escalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,Whatever. Just don't expect me to put in extra effort if this keeps happening.,2024-09-03 22:16:59

4850,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,And it's your responsibility to actually pay attention to your emails!,2024-09-03 21:47:02
4851,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_4,"This isn't helping, guys. Can we just focus on rescheduling the meeting?",2024-09-03 21:49:02
4852,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_3,"Hold on, Tom. We wouldn't need to reschedule if Jake had just done his job right.",2024-09-03 21:58:02
4853,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,Excuse me? I've been juggling multiple tasks while you two were nowhere to be found!,2024-09-03 22:07:02
4854,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_1,Don't even start with that! We've been working our butts off on the presentation because someone couldn't handle it.,2024-09-03 22:16:02
4855,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_3,"Let's face it, Jake, you're the reason we're falling behind. This happens every time.",2024-09-03 22:22:02
4856,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault? How convenient for you to blame me when things go wrong.",2024-09-03 22:25:02
4857,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_1,"We're not blaming you for everything, just this particular mess.",2024-09-03 22:30:02
4858,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_4,Can we chill for a second? Arguing isn't going to get us anywhere.,2024-09-03 22:31:02
4859,escalatory_conversation_329,speaker_3,"Maybe if Jake stopped messing up, we wouldn't",2024-09-03 22:33:02
4860,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,Why did you use my design without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:04:04
4861,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,"Because your design was just lying there, and we were on a tight deadline!",2024-09-03 21:14:04
4862,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,That doesn't give you the right to take my work. You should have at least asked.,2024-09-03 21:24:04
4863,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,"Look, we didn't have time to get everyone's approval. The client was breathing down our necks.",2024-09-03 21:31:04
4864,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,This isn’t just about the time. It's about respect and teamwork.,2024-09-03 21:35:04
4865,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on getting the project finished? This isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:41:04
4866,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,It’s hard to focus when my contributions are being disregarded.,2024-09-03 21:45:04
4867,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,Disregarded? We used your design. That's a sign we trust your work!,2024-09-03 21:50:04
4868,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,"Trust? If you trusted me, you would have told me you were going to use it.",2024-09-03 21:58:04
4869,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,You're overreacting. It's just a design; it's not the end of the world.,2024-09-03 22:06:04
4870,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_3,"Seriously, we need to move past this. We're all on the same team here.",2024-09-03 22:07:04
4871,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,I’m not overreacting. This is about setting a precedent. What if this happens again?,2024-09-03 22:11:04
4872,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,"Then we're going to handle it like adults and talk it out. But right now, we need to deliver.",2024-09-03 22:16:04
4873,escalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,"Handling it like adults means communicating upfront, not just taking what you need.",2024-09-03 22:25:04

4876,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again, Sarah. It's called having responsibilities. You should try it sometime.",2024-09-03 21:00:07
4877,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,Seriously? You know we need to practice together to sound good. Your excuses are getting old.,2024-09-03 21:07:07
4878,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_3,Can both of you chill? We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 21:16:07
4879,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,"Well, how can we be a team if one member doesn't even show up on time?",2024-09-03 21:18:07
4880,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, I'd actually want to be here.",2024-09-03 21:23:07
4881,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,Control freak? I'm just trying to make sure we don't embarrass ourselves at the school concert!,2024-09-03 21:29:07
4882,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"If you think you can do better, why don't you play my parts too?",2024-09-03 21:39:07
4883,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_3,"This is pointless, guys. We need to focus on the music.",2024-09-03 21:44:07
4884,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,We can't focus on the music if Lisa keeps holding us back.,2024-09-03 21:50:07
4885,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Maybe if you communicated better, I'd feel motivated to show up.",2024-09-03 21:53:07
4886,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,I wouldn't have to communicate the same thing over and over if you just listened the first time.,2024-09-03 21:57:07
4887,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,You're such a perfectionist. It's impossible to meet your standards!,2024-09-03 22:07:07
4888,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_3,Enough! This isn't getting us anywhere.,2024-09-03 22:13:07
4889,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,It's getting us somewhere. It's showing that some of us care about practice more than others.,2024-09-03 22:18:07
4890,escalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Oh, like you're so perfect",2024-09-03 22:19:07
4891,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,I don't get why you always hog the bathroom in the morning.,2024-09-03 20:57:11
4892,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again. Why don't you just wake up earlier if it's such a problem?",2024-09-03 21:03:11
4893,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,Maybe because I set my alarm the same time every day and I don’t want to change my entire routine for you!,2024-09-03 21:12:11
4894,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,You're acting like I spend hours in there. It’s just 20 minutes. Why is that such a big deal?,2024-09-03 21:21:11
4895,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,It feels a lot longer when I'm late for work because of you!,2024-09-03 21:25:11
4896,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,It's not my fault you can't manage your time properly.,2024-09-03 21:32:11
4897,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,How can I manage my time when you don’t even let me know when you're done?,2024-09-03 21:39:11

4899,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,It would be decent of you to at least try to consider other people in this house!,2024-09-03 21:54:11
4900,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,You're the one who doesn't care about anyone else's schedule but your own!,2024-09-03 22:01:11
4901,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,That's rich coming from you. You know I have an early meeting every Wednesday and you still hog the bathroom!,2024-09-03 22:07:11
4902,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,Like your meeting is more important than what I have going on? Get over yourself.,2024-09-03 22:08:11
4903,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,"I'm not saying I'm more important, just that we need to find a compromise!",2024-09-03 22:11:11
4904,escalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,Compromise? You mean you getting everything your way?,2024-09-03 22:15:11

4907,escalatory_conversation_333,speaker_2,"Oh, sure, blame it all on me, Tom. Maybe if you had given me the right data, it wouldn't have happened!",2024-09-03 20:56:13
4908,escalatory_conversation_333,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop. This isn't helping. We still have to figure out how to fix this mess before the next meeting.",2024-09-03 21:03:13
4909,escalatory_conversation_333,speaker_1,"Fix it? How do you suggest we fix something that's already ruined, Emily? The board members must think we're incompetent.",2024-09-03 21:06:13

5002,escalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,You're impossible to talk to when you're like this.,2024-09-03 22:12:31
5003,escalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,And you're impossible to trust with anything valuable.,2024-09-03 22:20:31
5004,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,Why didn't you clean the kitchen like you promised?,2024-09-03 21:04:34
5005,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,I was busy. Why didn't you take out the trash like you said you would?,2024-09-03 21:05:34
5006,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,I had a long day at work! You know that. What's your excuse?,2024-09-03 21:09:34
5007,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,"Oh, because you're the only one who has a hard day? I was working too, you know.",2024-09-03 21:18:34
5008,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,You always have an excuse. This isn't just about today. It's about every time I ask you to do something.,2024-09-03 21:27:34
5009,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,And you think you're perfect? What about the time you forgot to walk the dog?,2024-09-03 21:33:34
5010,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,That was one time! And I apologized for it! You never apologize for anything.,2024-09-03 21:36:34
5011,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't have to apologize if you weren't always on my case.,2024-09-03 21:39:34
5012,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,I'm on your case because you never follow through with anything!,2024-09-03 21:41:34
5013,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,And you always make everything about yourself! Maybe that's the real issue here.,2024-09-03 21:48:34
5014,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,I'm done talking to you if you can't take responsibility for anything.,2024-09-03 21:55:34
5015,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,Fine! Maybe we shouldn't talk at all if this is how it's going to be.,2024-09-03 21:56:34
5016,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_3,You two need to calm down. This whole argument is blown out of proportion.,2024-09-03 22:02:34
5017,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,Stay out of it! This doesn't concern you.,2024-09-03 22:06:34
5018,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_3,It does concern me when I have to listen to you both yelling all night.,2024-09-03 22:07:34
5019,escalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,Oh great,2024-09-03 22:10:34

5021,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,"I didn't forget, Janice. I was overloaded with the tasks you handed me last minute.",2024-09-03 21:01:39
5022,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_1,"Don't put this on me. Everyone had the same timeline, and they managed just fine.",2024-09-03 21:11:39
5023,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you didn't micromanage every detail, I could actually get things done on time!",2024-09-03 21:19:39
5024,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_3,Both of you just calm down. Blaming each other won't solve anything.,2024-09-03 21:25:39

5028,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_1,Easy for you to say when you're not the one cleaning up someone's mess every time.,2024-09-03 21:42:39
5029,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,Mess? How about you admit that your unrealistic expectations are the real problem here?,2024-09-03 21:52:39
5030,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_3,This isn't getting us anywhere. Can we focus on a solution instead of pointing fingers?,2024-09-03 21:56:39
5031,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_1,"Fine. Chris, can you actually commit to meeting deadlines if we redistribute some of the workload?",2024-09-03 22:00:39
5032,escalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,Maybe if Janice stops breathing down my neck and actually trusts me to do my job.,2024-09-03 22:03:39

5038,escalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,You could have at least sent me a message or a quick text!,2024-09-03 21:33:42

5044,escalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,What is that supposed to mean?,2024-09-03 22:09:42
5045,escalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,"It means you're often unprepared, and then you blame us!",2024-09-03 22:19:42

5048,escalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,How dare you question my commitment? I put in late hours for this project!,2024-09-03 22:42:42

5058,escalatory_conversation_343,speaker_2,Communicated better? I sent you guys plenty of emails. It's not my fault you don't read them.,2024-09-03 21:30:44

5103,escalatory_conversation_346,speaker_3,You're both just pointing fingers. We all have flaws. We need to figure this out or we'll keep losing.,2024-09-03 22:03:54
5104,escalatory_conversation_346,speaker_2,"Fine, let's figure this out. But first, admit you were out of position.",2024-09-03 22:06:54
5105,escalatory_conversation_346,speaker_1,I'll admit nothing. Maybe you need to learn how to make a proper pass.,2024-09-03 22:15:54

5108,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead with the presentation without consulting any of us first.,2024-09-03 20:55:57
5109,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to make a decision! We were running out of time, and no one else was stepping up.",2024-09-03 20:56:57
5110,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_3,"Stepping up? How can you call that ""stepping up""? You completely ignored our input!",2024-09-03 21:03:57
5111,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,Ignored your input? When did any of you actually offer any suggestions? All I heard were complaints and indecision.,2024-09-03 21:11:57
5112,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,"We had a plan, and you just threw it out the window. The clients were confused because it wasn't what we discussed.",2024-09-03 21:12:57
5113,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"Plans change. You all had a chance to contribute, but you didn't. So, I took charge.",2024-09-03 21:21:57
5114,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_3,"Taking charge doesn't mean bulldozing over everyone else's opinions. We’re a team, or did you forget that?",2024-09-03 21:31:57
5115,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"A team that couldn't reach a consensus! If I hadn't made a decision, we'd still be arguing.",2024-09-03 21:35:57
5116,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,It’s about respect! Not just making the first move because you got impatient.,2024-09-03 21:44:57
5117,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"Oh, and “respect” means dragging things out until we miss our deadline? Get real!",2024-09-03 21:53:57
5118,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_3,"Can we at least agree that from now on, decisions of this magnitude need everyone's agreement?",2024-09-03 22:01:57
5119,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,How do you propose we do that when no one speaks? I only acted because everyone was frozen.,2024-09-03 22:08:57
5120,escalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,,2024-09-03 22:15:57

5122,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,"I had to. You weren't pulling your weight, and it was dragging us both down.",2024-09-03 21:00:00
5123,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,That's not true and you know it! I was doing my part; you just wanted to control everything.,2024-09-03 21:08:00
5124,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,"Controlling? Really? If I didn't take charge, we wouldn't have a project to submit.",2024-09-03 21:14:00
5125,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,"You're unbelievable. I was working hard, and you didn't even notice. You just dismissed my contributions.",2024-09-03 21:23:00
5126,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,Contributions? Barely! You missed half the meetings and ignored my feedback on your sections.,2024-09-03 21:26:00
5127,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,"Maybe if you communicated instead of dictating, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:35:00
5128,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault you can't handle teamwork? That's rich.",2024-09-03 21:44:00
5129,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,You know what? Maybe we shouldn't have teamed up at all. I can't work with someone who doesn't respect me.,2024-09-03 21:51:00
5130,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,"Respect? You earn respect by being responsible, not by blaming others for your mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:58:00
5131,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,"Fine then. Next time, I'll make sure to avoid teaming up with micromanaging control freaks like you.",2024-09-03 22:02:00
5132,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,Great! And I'll make sure to avoid slackers who can't handle constructive criticism.,2024-09-03 22:09:00
5133,escalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,Enjoy doing everything yourself then. Good luck without me.,2024-09-03 22:18:00

5137,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,"That's not the point! You didn't even ask for permission. It's my work, and you took all the credit for it!",2024-09-03 21:10:03
5138,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you communicated better, I wouldn't have had to step in and save our team's grade.",2024-09-03 21:12:03
5139,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just calm down and solve this? We still have to finish the last part of the presentation together.",2024-09-03 21:16:03
5140,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,"Solve this? How can we, when Alex thinks it's okay to steal someone else's effort?",2024-09-03 21:20:03
5141,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,I didn't steal anything! I merely adapted your research for the good of the team!,2024-09-03 21:29:03
5142,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,"Adapting without asking is still dishonest. Now, our professor thinks you did all the work, and what am I left with? Nothing!",2024-09-03 21:38:03
5143,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_3,"Look, maybe there’s a way we can share the credit here. Bella deserves recognition for her work, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:46:03
5144,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I could mention Bella’s contribution in the final submission, but she needs to chill out.",2024-09-03 21:47:03
5145,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,Mention? That’s hardly fair compensation after downplaying my role entirely.,2024-09-03 21:55:03
5146,escalatory_conversation_349,speaker_3,"Alex, Bella’s right. We need to figure out a more fair solution. Maybe",2024-09-03 22:02:03
5147,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and changed the project without telling me!,2024-09-03 21:00:07
5148,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"I had to. You were dragging your feet, and we were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:09:07

5151,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,"Oh, so now my work isn't good enough for you? Why didn’t you just say that from the start?",2024-09-03 21:25:07
5152,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"I tried to give you feedback, but you wouldn’t listen!",2024-09-03 21:28:07
5153,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,Feedback? All you did was criticize everything without any constructive advice.,2024-09-03 21:37:07
5154,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but pointing out mistakes is part of the process. You can’t expect me to sugarcoat everything.",2024-09-03 21:40:07
5155,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,There’s a way to be critical without being condescending. Have you ever thought about that?,2024-09-03 21:45:07
5156,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn’t take everything so personally, we wouldn’t be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:55:07
5157,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,You know what? Maybe we shouldn't even be working together if this is how you handle things.,2024-09-03 22:02:07
5158,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,Fine by me. I’d rather work solo than deal with your constant whining.,2024-09-03 22:08:07
5159,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,Good luck with that. Let's see how far you get without my input.,2024-09-03 22:14:07
5160,escalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"I’ll do just fine, thanks. At least I won't",2024-09-03 22:22:07
5161,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,You never listen to my ideas during project meetings.,2024-09-03 21:04:11
5162,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,That's because your ideas are usually unrealistic.,2024-09-03 21:09:11
5163,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,Unrealistic? At least I have ideas! You contribute nothing.,2024-09-03 21:16:11
5164,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,I contribute nothing? I'm the one who keeps us on track.,2024-09-03 21:17:11
5165,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,How can you even say that when you're always late and unprepared?,2024-09-03 21:25:11
5166,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,Late? Maybe because I'm picking up the slack for your useless suggestions.,2024-09-03 21:26:11
5167,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,"My suggestions are not useless! They're innovative, unlike your boring, outdated methods.",2024-09-03 21:31:11

5170,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,Negative attitude? I'm just being realistic. Someone has to be.,2024-09-03 21:48:11
5171,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,You're not realistic; you're a pessimist who shoots down every idea.,2024-09-03 21:53:11
5172,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,And you're a dreamer who lives in a fantasy land.,2024-09-03 22:02:11
5173,escalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,Better to dream big than to be stuck in your narrow-minded rut.,2024-09-03 22:03:11

5198,escalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Tom. You weren't the one left to cover his mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:25:19
5199,escalatory_conversation_353,speaker_2,"Mistakes? I was trying to win, not slow us down with a failing strategy.",2024-09-03 21:32:19
5200,escalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,A failing strategy? We worked on that for weeks. You just threw it all away like it was nothing!,2024-09-03 21:41:19

5205,escalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,Maybe because I actually stick to the plan and don't go rogue!,2024-09-03 22:18:19

5211,escalatory_conversation_354,speaker_2,Really? Because I remember you billing the Peterson account wrong. That nearly cost us a fortune.,2024-09-03 21:21:22
5212,escalatory_conversation_354,speaker_1,At least I fixed it! You didn't even notice your own screw-up until I pointed it out.,2024-09-03 21:28:22

5222,escalatory_conversation_355,speaker_2,My mess? I only left a couple of tools out. Your projects take up way more space!,2024-09-03 21:08:26
5223,escalatory_conversation_355,speaker_1,Those tools are in my way. I can’t work with your clutter everywhere.,2024-09-03 21:16:26
5224,escalatory_conversation_355,speaker_2,Clutter? It's called efficiency. I keep everything I need close by.,2024-09-03 21:17:26
5225,escalatory_conversation_355,speaker_1,Efficiency? More like laziness. You never clean up after you’re done.,2024-09-03 21:27:26
5226,escalatory_conversation_355,speaker_2,At least I'm actually building something useful. Your junk just sits there forever.,2024-09-03 21:32:26

5324,escalatory_conversation_361,speaker_1,Micromanage? How about I handle everything myself since you can’t be relied on?,2024-09-03 22:18:46
5325,escalatory_conversation_361,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe you should!",2024-09-03 22:20:46
5326,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,Why did you go ahead and submit the group project without discussing it with us first?,2024-09-03 20:57:49
5327,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,Because no one else was stepping up to make the final changes! Someone had to do it.,2024-09-03 21:07:49
5328,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,We agreed we would review it together one last time. You totally ignored that.,2024-09-03 21:11:49
5329,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_3,"Yeah, and there are mistakes in the presentation that we could have caught if we had another look.",2024-09-03 21:13:49
5330,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,I didn't see anyone else volunteering to handle it! You can't blame me for wanting to get it done on time.,2024-09-03 21:19:49
5331,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,You always do this! Taking control last minute and then expecting us to deal with the fallout.,2024-09-03 21:26:49
5332,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_3,We might lose points because of the errors. How is that fair to the rest of us?,2024-09-03 21:32:49
5333,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"Maybe if you contributed more during the drafting phase, we wouldn’t be in this mess now.",2024-09-03 21:42:49
5334,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_3,"That's not the point. We were supposed to be a team, not just follow your lead without input.",2024-09-03 21:50:49
5335,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,And now we all look bad because of your decision. This isn't just about you.,2024-09-03 21:53:49
5336,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"Fine, next time you can do all the work and let’s see how perfectly it goes.",2024-09-03 21:57:49
5337,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_3,It's not about one person doing all the work. It's about communication and collaboration.,2024-09-03 22:00:49
5338,escalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"Oh, now everyone wants to talk about collaboration? Where was all this teamwork attitude when I needed help?",2024-09-03 22:10:49
5339,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,Why didn't you finish the project report? It's due tomorrow!,2024-09-03 21:05:52
5340,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,I thought you were handling it! You didn't tell me I had to do the whole report!,2024-09-03 21:06:52
5341,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,Are you kidding me? I sent you multiple reminders!,2024-09-03 21:15:52
5342,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,"Well, I never got them! Maybe you should check your messages before blaming me.",2024-09-03 21:17:52
5343,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,"This is unbelievable. Every time we have a big deadline, you drop the ball!",2024-09-03 21:19:52
5344,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,"Oh, and you're perfect, right? You always act like you’re the only one doing any work!",2024-09-03 21:24:52
5345,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,At least I actually do my part! What were you even busy with?,2024-09-03 21:34:52
5346,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,I've been swamped with the marketing strategy. Something you conveniently ignore!,2024-09-03 21:43:52
5347,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,The marketing strategy is not due for another week! This report was the priority!,2024-09-03 21:49:52
5348,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,"Maybe if you helped organize our tasks better, we wouldn't have this problem!",2024-09-03 21:55:52
5349,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,Don't try to pin this on me. You knew how important this was!,2024-09-03 21:56:52
5350,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,And you knew I was stretched thin. But did you care? No.,2024-09-03 21:59:52
5351,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,You should have said something if you couldn't handle it! Now we look unprofessional.,2024-09-03 22:04:52
5352,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,"I shouldn't have to! We’re supposed to be a team, but you always treat me like I'm your assistant.",2024-09-03 22:10:52
5353,escalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,"If you did your share, I wouldn't have to!",2024-09-03 22:18:52
5354,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"You never show up to the meetings on time, and it's affecting the entire group's progress!",2024-09-03 20:56:55
5355,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault the project is behind schedule?",2024-09-03 21:03:55
5356,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"Yes, it is! If you actually contributed, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:10:55
5357,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. We need to focus on finding a solution, not blaming each other.",2024-09-03 21:14:55
5358,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,How can we find a solution when certain people don't even care enough to show up on time?,2024-09-03 21:15:55
5359,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,I'm juggling multiple projects. Excuse me for having a lot on my plate!,2024-09-03 21:22:55
5360,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_3,"That's understandable, but we all have busy schedules. We need to prioritize this project.",2024-09-03 21:31:55
5361,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,Prioritize? Are you kidding me? I've been prioritizing this and covering for you constantly!,2024-09-03 21:39:55
5362,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"Oh please, you act like you're the only one doing any work. I've contributed plenty!",2024-09-03 21:41:55
5363,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,Contributed? Really? Name one thing you've successfully completed!,2024-09-03 21:44:55
5364,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"I did the entire market research for our last presentation, remember?",2024-09-03 21:46:55
5365,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_3,"Alright, enough. We're getting nowhere with this argument. Let's set some ground rules moving forward.",2024-09-03 21:47:55
5366,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,Ground rules? Like what?,2024-09-03 21:55:55
5367,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_3,Like ensuring that everyone shows up on time and dividing tasks more effectively.,2024-09-03 21:58:55
5368,escalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"Fine, but if we're setting rules, let's make sure everyone sticks to them,",2024-09-03 22:06:55
5369,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,"I can't believe you sabotaged the group project, Lia.",2024-09-03 20:59:59
5370,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,"Sabotaged? Really, Max? I was just trying to fix your mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:00:59
5371,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,Fix my mistakes? You completely rewrote my entire section without even asking me!,2024-09-03 21:09:59
5372,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_3,"Guys, both of you, calm down. This isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:13:59
5373,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,"What do you mean ""calm down,"" Ava? Lia just made us look like idiots in front of the whole class!",2024-09-03 21:14:59
5374,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,"Maybe if Max had done his part properly, I wouldn't have had to step in last minute!",2024-09-03 21:15:59
5375,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_4,We need to talk this through rationally. Accusations aren't solving anything.,2024-09-03 21:24:59
5376,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,Rationally? There's nothing rational about Lia undermining all my hard work!,2024-09-03 21:34:59
5377,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,Undermining? I was improving! Your data was all wrong!,2024-09-03 21:35:59
5378,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_3,Let's focus on what we can fix now instead of blaming each other.,2024-09-03 21:39:59
5379,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_4,"Agreed. We have to present again tomorrow, so let's figure this out.",2024-09-03 21:48:59
5380,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,Why should I even bother if Lia's just going to change everything again?,2024-09-03 21:57:59
5381,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,"If you can't handle constructive criticism, maybe you shouldn't be part of the group.",2024-09-03 22:01:59
5382,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_3,"That's uncalled for, Lia. Max, you need to be open to feedback too.",2024-09-03 22:03:59
5383,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_4,Exactly. The project isn't just one person's effort.,2024-09-03 22:07:59
5384,escalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,,2024-09-03 22:16:59
5385,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up to the meeting today. We were all counting on you.,2024-09-03 21:04:01
5386,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's all my fault now? I had other things to handle, okay?",2024-09-03 21:08:01
5387,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,"Everyone had things to handle, but we prioritized this because it’s important. You just don't seem to care about the project.",2024-09-03 21:12:01
5388,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,"That’s not true! I care, but I can't be everywhere at once. Maybe if you guys planned better, this wouldn't happen.",2024-09-03 21:14:01
5389,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_3,Seriously? Planning better? We gave everyone a week's notice for this. The least you could do was inform us you wouldn't make it.,2024-09-03 21:24:01
5390,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,And the least you could do is not jump to conclusions. Did you even try to understand my situation?,2024-09-03 21:33:01
5391,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_4,"We all have situations, but we make it work. You constantly have excuses, and it's dragging us down.",2024-09-03 21:43:01
5392,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,You're saying I’m dragging you down? Maybe you should look at your own contributions first!,2024-09-03 21:46:01
5393,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,Enough with the deflecting! Just admit you messed up. It's always someone else's fault with you.,2024-09-03 21:53:01
5394,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_3,"And while you're at it, explain how we can depend on you moving forward because right now, we can't.",2024-09-03 21:58:01
5395,escalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,"Fine! You want me to admit it? Yes, I missed the meeting. But maybe if you guys weren't so controlling and actually listened, I'd be more involved.",2024-09-03 22:08:01
5396,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,Why did you even bother to come if you’re not going to contribute anything?,2024-09-03 20:58:05
5397,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,Contribute? I’m the only one who has been actually working on this!,2024-09-03 21:06:05
5398,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,Oh really? Because all I see is you messing around on your phone.,2024-09-03 21:16:05
5399,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,"Seriously, we need to get this presentation done, and you’re both acting like children.",2024-09-03 21:23:05
5400,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,Acting like children? I’m not the one who disappeared for an hour without saying anything!,2024-09-03 21:27:05
5401,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,"Yeah, what was up with that? We needed you, and you just vanished.",2024-09-03 21:37:05
5402,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,"I had an important call to make. Unlike you two, I have responsibilities outside of this project.",2024-09-03 21:40:05
5403,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,"Oh please, you always have some excuse. This happens every single time we work on a group project.",2024-09-03 21:42:05
5404,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,"If it’s so important, maybe you shouldn’t have signed up for this in the first place.",2024-09-03 21:44:05
5405,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,You guys don’t get it. My life is more complicated than you realize.,2024-09-03 21:50:05
5406,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,And that’s our problem because…?,2024-09-03 21:58:05
5407,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,"Right. If you can’t juggle everything, maybe you should drop something, like this project.",2024-09-03 22:08:05
5408,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,Fine! I will. Let’s see how far you get without my part of the research.,2024-09-03 22:16:05
5409,escalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,"Like we can’t handle that on our own? Go ahead, we don’t need you.",2024-09-03 22:19:05
5410,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,Why did you think it was a good idea to change our project topic without discussing it with the team first?,2024-09-03 21:05:08
5411,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,"Because the original topic was boring and wouldn't have gotten us a good grade, obviously.",2024-09-03 21:09:08
5412,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,That's not your decision to make alone! We had an agreement.,2024-09-03 21:18:08
5413,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_3,I didn't even know about the change until today! This is ridiculous.,2024-09-03 21:21:08
5414,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,You're all overreacting. I secured a better topic; you should be thanking me.,2024-09-03 21:26:08
5415,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,"Overreacting? We're supposed to be a team, and you just went rogue. That's not how collaboration works.",2024-09-03 21:31:08
5416,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_4,"We need every minute we have left, and now we have to redo all our research because of you.",2024-09-03 21:40:08
5417,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,You're acting like this new topic isn't a better fit. We'll finish it faster; you just don't see it yet.,2024-09-03 21:50:08
5418,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_3,"No, what we see is a lack of respect for everyone else's input. It's not just your grade on the line.",2024-09-03 21:55:08
5419,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,"Exactly. We're supposed to trust each other, and you just broke that trust.",2024-09-03 22:03:08
5420,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,"Fine, if you all think you can do better, go ahead. Do it without me.",2024-09-03 22:06:08
5421,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_4,"That's not the point! We need to resolve this together, not fall apart.",2024-09-03 22:13:08
5422,escalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe I don't need this kind of negativity. Good luck with your 'perfect' teamwork.,2024-09-03 22:16:08
5423,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,I can't believe you invited Lisa to the party without asking me first.,2024-09-03 21:04:11
5424,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,Why should I need your permission to invite someone to my own party?,2024-09-03 21:13:11
5425,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,"Because we agreed we would make these decisions together, remember?",2024-09-03 21:23:11
5426,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,"Well, clearly we don't agree on everything. Maybe I don't need your input on every little thing.",2024-09-03 21:30:11
5427,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just calm down? It's not that big of a deal.",2024-09-03 21:31:11
5428,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,"It is a big deal when someone ignores our agreement. You’re always doing this, making decisions without consulting us.",2024-09-03 21:33:11
5429,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,"Oh please, stop exaggerating. It's just one person. Are you seriously that threatened by Lisa?",2024-09-03 21:35:11
5430,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,It’s not about Lisa. It’s about you breaking our trust and undermining what we agreed on!,2024-09-03 21:42:11
5431,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_3,Can we just find a solution instead of pointing fingers?,2024-09-03 21:51:11
5432,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,I'm tired of being accused of things. Just because you’re insecure doesn’t mean I have to run everything by you.,2024-09-03 22:01:11
5433,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,"Insecure? You’re the one who can't handle sharing control. This isn't about insecurity, it’s about respect.",2024-09-03 22:02:11
5434,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,Maybe you need to stop being so controlling.,2024-09-03 22:09:11
5435,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop. This argument isn't helping anything.",2024-09-03 22:19:11
5436,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,"You’re right, this isn’t helping, but ignoring the problem surely won’t solve it either!",2024-09-03 22:29:11
5437,escalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,Fine,2024-09-03 22:32:11
5438,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you used my presentation slides for your project, Tom?",2024-09-03 21:06:14
5439,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,"Because you always hog the spotlight, Sarah! I finally had a chance to shine.",2024-09-03 21:14:14
5440,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,That doesn't mean you can just steal my work and call it your own!,2024-09-03 21:18:14
5441,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! Your slides were boring; I improved them.",2024-09-03 21:23:14
5442,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,Improved? You just added animations and called it innovation.,2024-09-03 21:29:14
5443,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,"At least I made it interesting, unlike your usual dullness.",2024-09-03 21:36:14
5444,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,This isn't about being interesting; it's about ethics and giving credit where it's due.,2024-09-03 21:39:14
5445,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,Ethically? Since when do you care about ethics? You always take credit for our group work.,2024-09-03 21:46:14
5446,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it. We always decide together who presents.",2024-09-03 21:53:14
5447,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,"Yeah, and somehow it's always you. Funny how that works.",2024-09-03 22:00:14
5448,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,"Maybe because I actually put in effort, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 22:03:14
5449,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,"Oh, please. Stop acting like you're perfect. You've messed up presentations before.",2024-09-03 22:10:14
5450,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,"Everyone makes mistakes, but I don't resort to stealing when I do.",2024-09-03 22:17:14
5451,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,I didn't steal! I borrowed and enhanced it. There's a big difference!,2024-09-03 22:20:14
5452,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,"The difference is you didn't ask. You assumed, and that's the problem.",2024-09-03 22:22:14
5453,escalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,"Fine, I should have asked. Happy now?",2024-09-03 22:23:14
5454,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were applying for the same promotion?,2024-09-03 21:05:18
5455,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal. It's just a job application.,2024-09-03 21:11:18
5456,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Not a big deal? We've been working together for five years!,2024-09-03 21:17:18
5457,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,You're overreacting. There's room for both of us to go for it.,2024-09-03 21:19:18
5458,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Easy for you to say when you've been meeting with the boss behind my back!,2024-09-03 21:24:18
5459,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. Those were just regular check-ins. You could have done the same.",2024-09-03 21:28:18
5460,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,I can't believe you. This feels like a betrayal!,2024-09-03 21:33:18
5461,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,"Betrayal? That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?",2024-09-03 21:41:18
5462,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,"This isn't just drama. It's about trust, which you've clearly broken.",2024-09-03 21:51:18
5463,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,I'm trying to advance my career just like you. Why can't you just be happy for me?,2024-09-03 21:57:18
5464,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Happy for you? You went behind my back and now you want my support?,2024-09-03 22:02:18
5465,escalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,This isn't the end of the world. You're making it personal and it's not.,2024-09-03 22:03:18

5471,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,"Well, you weren't doing it right, so someone had to step up.",2024-09-03 21:03:21
5472,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,That's not for you to decide. We were supposed to be a team!,2024-09-03 21:09:21
5473,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,"A team that gets things done, yes. And you were slowing us down.",2024-09-03 21:19:21
5474,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,"Slowing us down? I was doing my best, unlike you, who can't stick to any deadlines!",2024-09-03 21:20:21
5475,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,Deadlines? Don't make me laugh. You can't handle the pressure and crumble at the last minute.,2024-09-03 21:30:21
5476,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,At least I'm trying to improve! You're just focused on pointing fingers instead of finding solutions.,2024-09-03 21:40:21

5479,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,Ridiculous? The entire team has to pick up your slack all the time!,2024-09-03 21:51:21
5480,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,"If that were true, then why didn't you discuss it rather than take over without a word?",2024-09-03 22:01:21
5481,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,Discuss? You mean more wasted time in meetings when we could be actually working?,2024-09-03 22:10:21
5482,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,Clear communication is not a waste of time. It's how we avoid misunderstandings like this!,2024-09-03 22:17:21
5483,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,Misunderstandings or your inability to accept feedback?,2024-09-03 22:23:21
5484,escalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,There's a difference between feedback and outright sabotage,2024-09-03 22:30:21

5487,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,Blowing things out of proportion? You left us hanging with no backup plan!,2024-09-03 21:18:23
5488,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually listened to my concerns, I wouldn’t have felt the need to leave.",2024-09-03 21:27:23
5489,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it’s my fault that you’re unreliable?",2024-09-03 21:32:23
5490,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,Unreliable? I’ve been picking up the slack for weeks because you won't delegate properly.,2024-09-03 21:35:23
5491,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who just bails when things get tough.,2024-09-03 21:45:23
5492,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,"Look, I have my own responsibilities and this project was draining me. You never considered that.",2024-09-03 21:47:23

5496,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,Complaining? I was offering solutions! But you never acknowledged them.,2024-09-03 22:17:23
5497,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,Solutions that were unrealistic and half-baked!,2024-09-03 22:25:23
5498,escalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,Unrealistic because you never gave them a chance! You think your way is the only way.,2024-09-03 22:28:23

5502,escalatory_conversation_374,speaker_1,That's not for you to decide! We should have discussed it as a team.,2024-09-03 21:13:27
5503,escalatory_conversation_374,speaker_2,Discuss? We don't have time to coddle everyone's feelings. We need results.,2024-09-03 21:17:27

5508,escalatory_conversation_374,speaker_3,Can we please just focus on solving the problem instead of blaming each other?,2024-09-03 21:36:27
5509,escalatory_conversation_374,speaker_4,"Yeah, pointing fingers isn't helping anyone. Let's figure out what went wrong and fix it.",2024-09-03 21:46:27

5517,escalatory_conversation_375,speaker_2,I had other commitments. You should've done it without me!,2024-09-03 21:06:31
5518,escalatory_conversation_375,speaker_1,We needed your input. Your tasks were crucial for the presentation.,2024-09-03 21:12:31

5549,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_1,Bossy? I'm trying to make sure we actually get somewhere. You barely even show up on time!,2024-09-03 21:15:37
5550,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_2,At least I'm not the one changing the setlist every week without asking anyone!,2024-09-03 21:21:37
5551,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_3,"Seriously, guys, we need to focus. We've got a gig in two days. Can we just work together for once?",2024-09-03 21:29:37
5552,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_1,Not until we all start pulling our weight. Some of us are actually putting effort into this.,2024-09-03 21:33:37
5553,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so controlling, people would be more motivated to contribute!",2024-09-03 21:36:37

5557,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_3,We're going in circles. Can we at least agree to a fixed setlist and stick to it?,2024-09-03 22:11:37
5558,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_1,"Fine, but everyone has to commit to it. No more skipping practices.",2024-09-03 22:19:37
5559,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_2,And no more dictator moves. We need collective decisions from now on.,2024-09-03 22:24:37
5560,escalatory_conversation_377,speaker_4,Agreed. So we're sticking with the current setlist and everyone shows up,2024-09-03 22:25:37

5602,escalatory_conversation_380,speaker_3,"Look, we're running out of time. Can we just work together and finish this cake?",2024-09-03 21:48:46
5603,escalatory_conversation_380,speaker_1,"Don't tell me what to do, Leo. You're not in charge here.",2024-09-03 21:53:46
5604,escalatory_conversation_380,speaker_2,"Yeah, Leo, why don't you make yourself useful for once?",2024-09-03 21:57:46
5605,escalatory_conversation_380,speaker_3,This is ridiculous. Do you guys want to win the,2024-09-03 22:06:46
5606,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you tell me you were planning to leave the band, dude?",2024-09-03 21:04:49
5607,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,I didn't exactly plan to tell anyone because I didn't think you'd care.,2024-09-03 21:06:49
5608,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,Are you serious? We’ve been playing together for five years and you think we wouldn't care?,2024-09-03 21:13:49
5609,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_3,"Yeah, what the hell, man? We deserve at least some heads-up.",2024-09-03 21:19:49
5610,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,"Look, I just can't deal with the lack of commitment anymore. Some of you barely show up for practice.",2024-09-03 21:27:49
5611,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,"If you had a problem, you should have talked to us instead of just walking out!",2024-09-03 21:37:49
5612,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_3,"We all have our lives, but that doesn’t mean we don’t care about this band.",2024-09-03 21:41:49
5613,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,Talking doesn't change the fact that you guys keep making excuses week after week.,2024-09-03 21:48:49
5614,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,We're doing our best. Maybe you're expecting too much.,2024-09-03 21:51:49
5615,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_3,It's not like you're perfect either. Remember last month when you bailed on two gigs in a row?,2024-09-03 22:01:49
5616,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,Those were family emergencies! That's completely different.,2024-09-03 22:02:49
5617,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,And you didn't think our reasons might be valid too?,2024-09-03 22:08:49
5618,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_3,You can’t just accuse us of not caring without knowing the full story.,2024-09-03 22:10:49
5619,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,"Fine, but I need more dedication if I'm going to invest my time in this.",2024-09-03 22:16:49
5620,escalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,"Then let's set some clear expectations. If we know how serious you are, we can",2024-09-03 22:22:49
5621,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"Why are you always late to band practice, Emily? We're never going to nail this performance if you keep showing up whenever you feel like it.",2024-09-03 20:59:52
5622,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Alex. I have a job, you know. Not everyone has all day to practice like you do.",2024-09-03 21:09:52
5623,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_3,Can we all just focus on the music? Pointing fingers isn't going to help us sound better.,2024-09-03 21:18:52
5624,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Chris. You're never late, and you don’t have to pick up Emily’s slack every time.",2024-09-03 21:27:52
5625,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,"I'm not slacking! I contribute just as much as everyone else when I'm here. Maybe if you weren't so controlling, people would actually enjoy practice.",2024-09-03 21:31:52
5626,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"Controlling? I'm trying to keep this band together. We have a performance in a week, and we can't afford to mess this up.",2024-09-03 21:35:52
5627,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously, can we just get back to practicing? The audience isn't going to care who was late if we sound terrible.",2024-09-03 21:41:52
5628,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,"Alex always has to make it about himself, though. It's like the rest of us don't even matter.",2024-09-03 21:51:52
5629,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"This isn't about me. It's about all of us, and right now, you're dragging us down.",2024-09-03 22:01:52
5630,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,"If you think I’m such a problem, maybe you should find another bassist.",2024-09-03 22:06:52
5631,escalatory_conversation_382,speaker_3,No one needs to quit. We just need to communicate better and respect,2024-09-03 22:11:52
5632,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,I can't believe you ate the last slice of pizza!,2024-09-03 21:03:56
5633,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,What do you mean? You had more slices than anyone else!,2024-09-03 21:08:56
5634,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:13:56
5635,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_3,Can you both stop arguing about this? It's just pizza.,2024-09-03 21:15:56
5636,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you didn't even put in for the order.",2024-09-03 21:22:56
5637,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,That's another thing! Why do you think you can just mooch off our food all the time?,2024-09-03 21:28:56
5638,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_3,"What does it matter? We're all friends here, aren't we?",2024-09-03 21:32:56
5639,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,Friends shouldn't take advantage of each other.,2024-09-03 21:36:56
5640,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,"Exactly! You keep freeloading, and it's really starting to annoy us.",2024-09-03 21:39:56
5641,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_3,"Fine! Next time, I'll just skip hanging out with you guys.",2024-09-03 21:49:56
5642,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,Maybe that's for the best if you're going to keep acting like this.,2024-09-03 21:58:56
5643,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,"Yeah, maybe we all need a break from each other.",2024-09-03 22:08:56
5644,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_3,"I see how it is. You both have issues, and now you're taking it out on me.",2024-09-03 22:12:56
5645,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,We're not taking it out on you; we're just pointing out what's fair.,2024-09-03 22:15:56
5646,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,Stop trying to twist the situation. This is about fairness and respect.,2024-09-03 22:21:56
5647,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_3,Respect? Respect goes both ways. Maybe both of you need to look in the mirror.,2024-09-03 22:24:56
5648,escalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,"Oh, like you're the model of perfection",2024-09-03 22:28:56
5649,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were taking credit for my idea in the meeting?,2024-09-03 21:05:00
5650,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I didn't take credit for anything!,2024-09-03 21:11:00
5651,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,Oh really? Then why did Mr. Johnson congratulate you specifically for the project proposal I worked on?,2024-09-03 21:18:00
5652,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,"Maybe because I was the one who explained it clearly, unlike your muddled explanation last time? It's called teamwork.",2024-09-03 21:22:00
5653,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,Teamwork doesn't mean stealing someone's work and passing it off as your own. You know how much time I invested in that proposal!,2024-09-03 21:24:00
5654,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,"And I refined it, made it presentable. Without my input, it wouldn't have gone anywhere.",2024-09-03 21:32:00
5655,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,That's ridiculous. You made a few tweaks; I built that proposal from scratch.,2024-09-03 21:39:00
5656,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,"Whether you like it or not, the final product was a team effort. Stop looking for reasons to complain.",2024-09-03 21:47:00
5657,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,Complain? I'm furious because you completely disregarded my efforts and took all the praise for yourself!,2024-09-03 21:57:00
5658,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,I didn't hear you objecting while we were being praised. Seems to me you just want all the glory.,2024-09-03 21:58:00
5659,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,I was shocked! I couldn't believe what I was hearing. And now you act like I'm the problem?,2024-09-03 22:01:00
5660,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,"Maybe if you spent more time contributing during meetings instead of sulking, people would recognize your work more.",2024-09-03 22:04:00
5661,escalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,Sulking? I've been working my butt,2024-09-03 22:09:00
5662,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't tell me you were quitting the band.,2024-09-03 21:04:05
5663,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,Are you serious? You didn't even notice how miserable I was!,2024-09-03 21:07:05
5664,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,Miserable? We had some of our best rehearsals this month!,2024-09-03 21:15:05
5665,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"Best rehearsals for you maybe, but I feel like I'm just a backup in your personal show.",2024-09-03 21:24:05
5666,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,"A backup? We all contribute equally, and you know that!",2024-09-03 21:25:05
5667,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,Equally? You mean how 80% of our setlist is your solo stuff?,2024-09-03 21:32:05
5668,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,That's because no one else steps up with new material!,2024-09-03 21:38:05
5669,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"Maybe because whenever I suggest something, it gets immediately shot down!",2024-09-03 21:42:05
5670,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,"That's not true. We tried your song last month, and it just didn't fit our style.",2024-09-03 21:52:05
5671,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,Our style or your vision of our style? There's a difference.,2024-09-03 22:02:05
5672,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,So now you’re accusing me of being a control freak?,2024-09-03 22:09:05
5673,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"If the shoe fits, wear it!",2024-09-03 22:15:05
5674,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_3,Can both of you just stop? This isn’t solving anything!,2024-09-03 22:18:05
5675,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you’re taking sides?",2024-09-03 22:21:05
5676,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_3,"No, I’m not taking sides. I’m just tired of the constant fighting.",2024-09-03 22:31:05
5677,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,It's easy for you to say. You're not the one feeling ignored.,2024-09-03 22:33:05
5678,escalatory_conversation_385,speaker_3,"We all have issues, but yelling isn't fixing them.",2024-09-03 22:38:05
5679,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"Why is the project still not done, Julie? We were supposed to be done yesterday!",2024-09-03 20:58:08
5680,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,"Well, Mike, maybe if you had done your part on time, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:07:08
5681,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"I did my part! You were supposed to work on the graphics, and it's still a disaster.",2024-09-03 21:14:08
5682,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,Seriously? I had to redo half of your content because it was full of mistakes!,2024-09-03 21:22:08
5683,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_3,"Hey, stop blaming each other. Both of you dropped the ball on this one.",2024-09-03 21:30:08
5684,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"Oh great, here comes Tina with the perfect solutions. Why don't you tell us exactly how to fix it, then?",2024-09-03 21:32:08
5685,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_3,I wouldn't have to if you two could get your act together for once.,2024-09-03 21:42:08
5686,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,"You know what, Tina? You barely contributed anything useful. So don't act like you're above us.",2024-09-03 21:49:08
5687,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_3,At least I didn't mess up as badly as you two. And I don't need to take this attitude for trying to help.,2024-09-03 21:50:08
5688,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,Is this seriously how we're going to handle our final project? By tearing each other apart?,2024-09-03 21:54:08
5689,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,Maybe it's the only way to make you realize you can't blame everything on me.,2024-09-03 21:55:08
5690,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_3,Enough! We either fix this together or fail together. Decide now.,2024-09-03 22:03:08
5691,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"Fine, let's try to salvage what's left. But this isn't over.",2024-09-03 22:11:08
5692,escalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,Agreed. But next,2024-09-03 22:17:08
5693,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,I can't believe you betrayed the study group by giving the wrong answers to the professor!,2024-09-03 21:04:11
5694,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,What are you talking about? Those were the answers we all agreed on!,2024-09-03 21:08:11
5695,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_3,"No, we agreed on the correct ones! You deliberately changed them to make us look bad.",2024-09-03 21:10:11
5696,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,Exactly! And now we're all going to fail this project because of you.,2024-09-03 21:13:11
5697,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,I didn't change anything on purpose! Maybe you guys should have paid more attention.,2024-09-03 21:15:11
5698,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_4,This is ridiculous. We're supposed to be a team. Why would you sabotage us like that?,2024-09-03 21:24:11
5699,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"I'm telling you, it was a mistake! How many times do I have to say it?",2024-09-03 21:32:11
5700,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,A mistake that costs us our grades isn't just a mistake! It's sabotage.,2024-09-03 21:36:11
5701,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_3,And you didn't even own up to it when the professor confronted us!,2024-09-03 21:42:11
5702,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,Because I didn't think I did anything wrong! I went with what I thought was right.,2024-09-03 21:50:11
5703,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_4,"Come on, we're all in this together. Stop trying to shift the blame.",2024-09-03 21:53:11
5704,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"I'm not shifting blame. If you guys had double-checked the answers, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 22:03:11
5705,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's our fault too? That's rich.",2024-09-03 22:07:11
5706,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_3,This isn't going anywhere. Maybe we should just ask the professor for a redo.,2024-09-03 22:13:11
5707,escalatory_conversation_387,speaker_4,"If we do that, it’s",2024-09-03 22:16:11
5708,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,Why do you always take credit for my ideas during our business meetings?,2024-09-03 20:58:14
5709,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,Are you serious right now? I've never taken credit for your ideas.,2024-09-03 20:59:14
5710,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,"Yes, you do! Just last week, you presented my proposal without even mentioning my name.",2024-09-03 21:01:14
5711,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,"That's because it was a team effort. We collaborate on everything, or did you forget that?",2024-09-03 21:04:14
5712,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,A team effort? You specifically used the examples I came up with and didn't say a word about my contribution.,2024-09-03 21:13:14
5713,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,Maybe because your examples weren't that great to begin with!,2024-09-03 21:17:14
5714,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,That's completely uncalled for! You know how much time I spent on that project.,2024-09-03 21:19:14
5715,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,And you think I didn't put any effort into it? I've been working nonstop too!,2024-09-03 21:22:14
5716,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,Then why can't you give credit where it's due? Why does it always have to be about you?,2024-09-03 21:28:14
5717,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,Maybe because I'm the one who pulls everything together at the end! You always leave things half-finished.,2024-09-03 21:29:14
5718,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it! I do my part, and just because it’s different from yours doesn’t mean it's less important.",2024-09-03 21:35:14
5719,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,"If your part was so important, then why does the board always look to me for the final decisions?",2024-09-03 21:40:14
5720,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,Because you hog the spotlight and make sure they only notice your efforts!,2024-09-03 21:43:14
5721,escalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,Or maybe because they see who,2024-09-03 21:47:14
5722,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:07:17
5723,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,I had other things to do. It's not like it's the end of the world.,2024-09-03 21:10:17
5724,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,Other things to do? This project is due next week!,2024-09-03 21:16:17
5725,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,You always have an excuse. We're all busy.,2024-09-03 21:26:17
5726,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you all didn't schedule the meetings at the worst times, I'd actually make it.",2024-09-03 21:30:17
5727,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,"Oh come on, we planned the meeting times together. You agreed to those times!",2024-09-03 21:38:17
5728,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,"Yeah, you're not being fair. We're all putting in the effort except you.",2024-09-03 21:46:17
5729,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,You think this project is the center of my universe? I've got my own stuff going on.,2024-09-03 21:53:17
5730,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,Everyone has stuff going on. It’s called responsibility.,2024-09-03 22:03:17
5731,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,"Don't lecture me on responsibility. Maybe if the project wasn't so poorly organized, I wouldn't need to skip the meetings.",2024-09-03 22:09:17
5732,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,Poorly organized? That's just an excuse. You're the one not carrying your weight.,2024-09-03 22:10:17
5733,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,"Whatever, like you all are so perfect. Half the time you're messing around instead of working.",2024-09-03 22:17:17
5734,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,At least we show up! How do you expect us to finish if you keep flaking out?,2024-09-03 22:22:17
5735,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,"It's not just flaking out, it's undermining the whole group.",2024-09-03 22:25:17
5736,escalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,I'm not undermining anything. You all just overreact to everything,2024-09-03 22:31:17
5737,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,Why did you cancel our group project meeting without telling any of us beforehand?,2024-09-03 21:01:20
5738,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,I already told you I had a family emergency! Do you expect me to put this project above my family?,2024-09-03 21:06:20
5739,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,But you could have at least sent a quick message! We were all waiting for over an hour!,2024-09-03 21:14:20
5740,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,"I'm not glued to my phone 24/7, okay? Sometimes unexpected things just happen!",2024-09-03 21:23:20
5741,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_3,"Guys, let's calm down. We need to figure out how to make up for lost time instead of arguing.",2024-09-03 21:31:20
5742,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,"It's just frustrating! We're already behind schedule, and this isn't helping!",2024-09-03 21:38:20
5743,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,"Ugh, like you’ve never had to cancel plans? You're overreacting!",2024-09-03 21:46:20
5744,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,"Overreacting? We have a deadline to meet, and now we're scrambling because you didn't communicate!",2024-09-03 21:55:20
5745,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_3,Can we just focus on the project? Pointing fingers isn’t going to help us finish it.,2024-09-03 22:02:20
5746,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,"Fine, I get it. How do you want to ""make up"" the time, then, Mr. Perfect?",2024-09-03 22:04:20
5747,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,We need to set up another meeting right away and actually stick to it this time.,2024-09-03 22:13:20
5748,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,"Alright, but if anyone else misses it, it's not just on me!",2024-09-03 22:23:20
5749,escalatory_conversation_390,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's all commit to being there and getting this done. How about tomorrow at 5 PM?,2024-09-03 22:32:20
5750,escalatory_conversation_391,**Scenario,College Project Group Dispute**,2024-09-03 21:02:23
5751,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,Why didn't you upload your part of the project last night like we agreed?,2024-09-03 21:11:23
5752,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,"I told you I had other assignments! Maybe if you actually listened, you'd know that.",2024-09-03 21:18:23
5753,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_3,"We all have other assignments, but we managed our time. Why can't you?",2024-09-03 21:26:23
5754,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you all had perfect lives with no complications.",2024-09-03 21:32:23
5755,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,This is a group project. You can't just leave us hanging like that.,2024-09-03 21:36:23
5756,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,"And I can't do everything alone! Maybe if you helped me with my part, this wouldn't be an issue.",2024-09-03 21:38:23
5757,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_3,Helped you? You've barely communicated with us the whole week!,2024-09-03 21:43:23
5758,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,I don't have to report my every move to you guys. This isn't a prison.,2024-09-03 21:46:23
5759,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,"We're not asking for constant updates, just some responsibility!",2024-09-03 21:47:23
5760,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_3,"Honestly, if you're too busy, maybe you shouldn't have joined this group in the first place.",2024-09-03 21:56:23
5761,escalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more understanding, I wouldn't be thinking about leaving it now!",2024-09-03 22:01:23
5762,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,"Why didn't you set the alarm like I asked, Sarah? We were supposed to leave early for the hike!",2024-09-03 21:00:26
5763,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,"I thought you were going to set it, Jack. You never made it clear that it was my responsibility.",2024-09-03 21:03:26
5764,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,How could you think that when I literally asked you to do it? This is exactly why we’re always late for everything.,2024-09-03 21:07:26
5765,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you communicated better, this wouldn't have happened! You're always blaming me for everything.",2024-09-03 21:16:26
5766,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,Amazing. Blame my communication skills when you're the one who can’t handle a simple task!,2024-09-03 21:25:26
5767,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,Simple task? Says the person who forgot the map last time we went hiking. How's that for responsibility?,2024-09-03 21:27:26
5768,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,At least I owned up to it and apologized! I didn’t try to deflect blame like you always do.,2024-09-03 21:29:26
5769,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,"Owned up? Right, after I reminded you a dozen times. You're one to talk about owning up.",2024-09-03 21:38:26
5770,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault again? Seems like you’re just looking for excuses to dodge responsibility!",2024-09-03 21:44:26
5771,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,I'm not dodging anything! Maybe you should look at how often you mess up and stop being so self-righteous.,2024-09-03 21:54:26
5772,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,"I mess up? Really, Sarah? Because from where I stand, I’m constantly picking up your slack.",2024-09-03 22:03:26
5773,escalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,"Right, Jack. Keep telling yourself that. You",2024-09-03 22:04:26
5774,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,"You always hog the lab equipment, Carla. How are any of us supposed to finish our experiments on time?",2024-09-03 21:03:29
5775,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Jack. Maybe if you'd plan your time better, you wouldn't need to blame me for your problems.",2024-09-03 21:04:29
5776,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_3,"This isn't about planning, Carla. You're using the microscope way longer than everyone else!",2024-09-03 21:10:29
5777,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,"Maybe because I actually have important research to do, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:12:29
5778,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,"That's not fair, Carla. We all have deadlines. You can't just monopolize the resources.",2024-09-03 21:17:29
5779,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_3,And it's not just the microscope. You do it with all the equipment. It's like you think this lab belongs to you.,2024-09-03 21:27:29
5780,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you guys were more competent, you wouldn't need to rely on the equipment so much.",2024-09-03 21:31:29
5781,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,Are you kidding me? We all made it here by being competent. You're not the only one who deserves to succeed.,2024-09-03 21:33:29
5782,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_3,Exactly. We're supposed to be a team. You're sabotaging us.,2024-09-03 21:39:29
5783,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,I'm not sabotaging anyone. You guys are just looking for excuses because you can't keep up.,2024-09-03 21:47:29
5784,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,"That's just ridiculous, Carla. You're the one causing the problem here. We're only calling it out because we need to fix it.",2024-09-03 21:54:29
5785,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_3,"If you can't share the equipment fairly, maybe we should report it to the professor.",2024-09-03 22:04:29
5786,escalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,"Go ahead, report it",2024-09-03 22:06:29
5787,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,I told you not to use my favorite mug for your paint brushes!,2024-09-03 20:59:33
5788,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,"Well, I couldn't find anything else to use, and it's just a mug.",2024-09-03 21:06:33
5789,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,Just a mug? It's a gift from Grandma!,2024-09-03 21:11:33
5790,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,You never told me that. You act like everything you own is sacred.,2024-09-03 21:17:33
5791,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,Maybe because you never ask before taking my things!,2024-09-03 21:20:33
5792,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,Maybe because your things are always in the way!,2024-09-03 21:28:33
5793,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,In the way? My stuff is in my room most of the time!,2024-09-03 21:30:33
5794,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,Your room that spills over into the living room and the kitchen!,2024-09-03 21:35:33
5795,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if you cleaned up your art supplies, there’d be more space!",2024-09-03 21:36:33
5796,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,My art supplies are my livelihood! Unlike your random collectibles!,2024-09-03 21:41:33
5797,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,They're not random! They have meaning to me!,2024-09-03 21:51:33
5798,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,Meaning that you never share and expect me to just understand!,2024-09-03 21:56:33
5799,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,"Because every time I try, you act like it's unimportant!",2024-09-03 22:06:33
5800,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,Maybe listen to my concerns before declaring your stuff is more important!,2024-09-03 22:13:33
5801,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,My stuff wouldn't annoy you if you respected my boundaries!,2024-09-03 22:20:33
5802,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,And my art wouldn't bother you if you understood my process!,2024-09-03 22:22:33
5803,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,I can't understand your process if you don't communicate it!,2024-09-03 22:23:33
5804,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,And I can't respect boundaries I don't know about!,2024-09-03 22:28:33
5805,escalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,,2024-09-03 22:37:33
5806,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday? We needed your part done.,2024-09-03 21:03:37
5807,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,"I had other things to do, okay? I'm not the only one in the group!",2024-09-03 21:13:37
5808,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,But you are the only one who keeps missing meetings! We're all counting on you to do your share.,2024-09-03 21:20:37
5809,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault that the project isn't coming along?",2024-09-03 21:30:37
5810,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,I'm just saying that your absence makes it hard for everyone else. We need your input.,2024-09-03 21:31:37
5811,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,And maybe I need some space. Ever thought about that?,2024-09-03 21:34:37
5812,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,Space? Seriously? You committed to this project like the rest of us.,2024-09-03 21:38:37
5813,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,"Yeah, well, things change. Maybe this project isn't as important to me as it is to you.",2024-09-03 21:43:37
5814,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,"Great, so now you're saying you don't care at all? Why didn't you say something sooner?",2024-09-03 21:52:37
5815,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,Because I knew you'd react just like this! Overdramatic about everything.,2024-09-03 22:01:37
5816,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,"Wow, thanks. Maybe if you actually communicated, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 22:02:37
5817,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so pushy, I wouldn't need to avoid you so much.",2024-09-03 22:10:37
5818,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,Pushy? I'm trying to keep us on track! Unlike some people.,2024-09-03 22:20:37
5819,escalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,Whatever. Think what you want. I'm done with this conversation.,2024-09-03 22:26:37
5820,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,Why did you go ahead and sign off on that design without consulting the team?,2024-09-03 21:05:40
5821,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,I didn't need to consult the team; it was my decision to make.,2024-09-03 21:09:40
5822,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,That's not how we agreed to operate. This affects all of us!,2024-09-03 21:16:40
5823,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you did your part of the job, I wouldn't have had to make that call alone.",2024-09-03 21:23:40
5824,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_3,"Hold on, both of you. Let's try to understand what happened here.",2024-09-03 21:27:40
5825,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,"No, we need to address this right now. It was selfish and unprofessional.",2024-09-03 21:30:40
5826,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,"Selfish? The only selfish one here is you, always dragging your feet on crucial decisions.",2024-09-03 21:35:40
5827,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_3,Accusations aren't helping. We need to figure out a solution.,2024-09-03 21:39:40
5828,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,The solution is simple. Stick to the agreed process.,2024-09-03 21:48:40
5829,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,The agreed process clearly doesn't work if we're always behind schedule because of you.,2024-09-03 21:54:40
5830,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_3,Can we please just take a step back and talk about how to make this work for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:04:40
5831,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,I'm tired of making things work while others ignore the rules.,2024-09-03 22:10:40
5832,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,And I'm tired of having to clean up the mess when you can't keep up.,2024-09-03 22:17:40
5833,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_3,Maybe we need to reevaluate our process so everyone feels included and responsible.,2024-09-03 22:25:40
5834,escalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,"I'm all for reevaluation, but what's the point if some people won't follow it?",2024-09-03 22:33:40
5835,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and signed off on the project redesign without consulting me.,2024-09-03 21:02:43
5836,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,"Are you serious? We were running out of time, and you were dragging your feet as usual!",2024-09-03 21:11:43
5837,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,Dragging my feet? I was making sure everything was perfect. You just rushed through it like you always do.,2024-09-03 21:21:43
5838,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,"At least I get things done. You're always nitpicking, and we end up missing deadlines because of you.",2024-09-03 21:23:43
5839,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,"That's because you never consider the details. Your work is sloppy, and it ends up costing us more time fixing your mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:30:43
5840,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,"My work is not sloppy! At least I have the initiative to make decisions when necessary, unlike you.",2024-09-03 21:35:43
5841,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're the hero? You're just a control freak who can't stand anyone questioning your decisions.",2024-09-03 21:44:43
5842,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,And you're just a perfectionist who can't stand any kind of progress if it's not done your way.,2024-09-03 21:48:43
5843,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,"You know what? Maybe we should just work separately. Clearly, we can't collaborate without butting heads.",2024-09-03 21:53:43
5844,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,Fine by me. Let's see if you can handle the pressure on your own. Don't come crying to me when you can't meet the next deadline.,2024-09-03 22:02:43
5845,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,And don't expect me to fix your messes anymore. Good luck handling the fallout on your own.,2024-09-03 22:07:43
5846,escalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,I will. At least I'll be moving forward instead,2024-09-03 22:10:43
5847,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:00:46
5848,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,"I had other things to do, okay? I can't always drop everything for this.",2024-09-03 21:07:46
5849,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,Other things? You've known about this deadline for weeks.,2024-09-03 21:12:46
5850,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,"Yeah, well, I have a life outside of this project. Unlike you apparently.",2024-09-03 21:15:46
5851,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_3,"Can you both just calm down? We need to figure out how to get this done, not point fingers.",2024-09-03 21:25:46
5852,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,We wouldn't be in this mess if someone bothered to prioritize.,2024-09-03 21:34:46
5853,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault? What about when you missed the first meeting?",2024-09-03 21:36:46
5854,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,"That was one time, and I had a valid reason. You just don't care.",2024-09-03 21:44:46
5855,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,"I care, but I'm not going to bend over backwards and stress out like you.",2024-09-03 21:51:46
5856,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_3,"Seriously, fighting isn't helping. We need solutions, not arguments.",2024-09-03 21:56:46
5857,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,Maybe the solution is for some people to start putting in genuine effort.,2024-09-03 22:00:46
5858,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,And maybe you need to relax and stop acting like this project is life or death.,2024-09-03 22:07:46
5859,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_3,Enough! Let's divide the remaining tasks again. Complaining won't finish the project.,2024-09-03 22:14:46
5860,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,"Fine. But if we're re-dividing tasks, someone else better step up this time.",2024-09-03 22:21:46
5861,escalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,"Fine by me. Just remember, it's not just on my shoulders if things don't get done",2024-09-03 22:31:46
5862,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,Why did you change the party venue without consulting me first?,2024-09-03 21:05:49
5863,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,Because the original venue was too small! It was a practical decision.,2024-09-03 21:14:49
5864,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,"Practical? We've been planning this for months, and now you just make decisions on your own?",2024-09-03 21:22:49
5865,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more involved, I wouldn't have to make decisions on my own.",2024-09-03 21:30:49
5866,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,That's not fair! I've been swamped with work and you know it.,2024-09-03 21:33:49
5867,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,Swamped with work? Or just uninterested? There is a difference.,2024-09-03 21:37:49
5868,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,Now you're questioning my interest? I can't believe you!,2024-09-03 21:46:49
5869,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,"Well, believe it. You haven't put in nearly as much effort as I have.",2024-09-03 21:47:49
5870,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,This isn't a competition! We're supposed to be partners.,2024-09-03 21:55:49
5871,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,Partners? You sure have a funny way of showing it.,2024-09-03 22:02:49
5872,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,"Fine, if you think you can do it all alone, go ahead. I'm done.",2024-09-03 22:08:49
5873,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,Maybe it's better that way. At least then I won't have to drag you along.,2024-09-03 22:13:49

5875,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,"Look, if you cared about this event at all, you would have been more present.",2024-09-03 22:21:49
5876,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,"This event was supposed to be for us, together. Not your solo project.",2024-09-03 22:23:49
5877,escalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,Maybe it feels like a solo project because,2024-09-03 22:24:49
5878,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the last play?,2024-09-03 21:06:52
5879,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,Are you serious right now? I didn't pass because you were out of position!,2024-09-03 21:10:52
5880,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,Out of position? I was wide open and you know it!,2024-09-03 21:14:52
5881,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,"Wide open for a second, maybe. You never hang onto the ball when it counts.",2024-09-03 21:18:52
5882,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on the game instead of pointing fingers?",2024-09-03 21:27:52
5883,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one being ignored!",2024-09-03 21:37:52
5884,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_3,I'm saying this bickering isn't helping us. We need to play as a team.,2024-09-03 21:44:52
5885,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,Play as a team? Tell that to someone who actually knows how to play.,2024-09-03 21:46:52
5886,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,See? This is exactly what I mean. You're always undermining me!,2024-09-03 21:52:52
5887,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,"Maybe if you pulled your weight, I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 22:02:52
5888,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_3,"Enough, both of you. We're losing because we can't work together.",2024-09-03 22:07:52
5889,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,We can't work together because someone refuses to pass the ball!,2024-09-03 22:12:52
5890,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,Or maybe it's because someone can't keep up with the plays!,2024-09-03 22:13:52
5891,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_3,Stop blaming each other. Let's focus on fixing this now.,2024-09-03 22:17:52
5892,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,"Fine, but this isn't the last time we'll talk about your attitude.",2024-09-03 22:25:52
5893,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,"Whatever, just don't mess up again out there.",2024-09-03 22:26:52
5894,escalatory_conversation_400,speaker_3,"Can we get back on track now, please?",2024-09-03 22:35:52
5895,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"You never follow the instructions, and now the project is a mess.",2024-09-03 21:07:55
5896,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,"I did follow the instructions. If you actually read them, you would see I didn’t do anything wrong.",2024-09-03 21:08:55
5897,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you’re saying I don’t read? That’s rich coming from someone who never even shows up to meetings on time.",2024-09-03 21:09:55
5898,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,Don’t twist this around on me! Your directions were vague and impossible to follow. How can you blame me for that?,2024-09-03 21:12:55
5899,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_3,"Both of you, can we focus on fixing this instead of pointing fingers?",2024-09-03 21:19:55
5900,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,It’s hard to fix anything when people refuse to take responsibility.,2024-09-03 21:21:55
5901,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,Responsibility? How am I supposed to be responsible for your terrible planning?,2024-09-03 21:22:55
5902,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,My planning? At least I did something! You just sit there and criticize.,2024-09-03 21:31:55
5903,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_3,Arguing isn’t going to help. We need to figure out what went wrong and correct it.,2024-09-03 21:34:55
5904,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,"Fine, let’s talk about the instructions you gave. They were unclear and left too much room for error.",2024-09-03 21:42:55
5905,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"And maybe if you asked questions instead of assuming, we wouldn’t be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:44:55
5906,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,"Or maybe if you communicated better, no one would need to ask questions.",2024-09-03 21:54:55
5907,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_3,"Look, how about we go through the steps one by one and identify where things went wrong?",2024-09-03 21:59:55
5908,escalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,It’s,2024-09-03 22:02:55
5909,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,Why did you turn off the game in the middle of my play?,2024-09-03 21:02:58
5910,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,Because you were hogging the controller for an hour!,2024-09-03 21:03:58
5911,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,I was about to beat the final boss! Couldn't you have waited?,2024-09-03 21:12:58
5912,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"You always say that, but it never happens!",2024-09-03 21:16:58
5913,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_3,Can you two just cut it out? We're supposed to be enjoying our Saturday.,2024-09-03 21:20:58
5914,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you already had your turn!",2024-09-03 21:22:58
5915,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"Yeah, don't act all high and mighty when you were on his side earlier!",2024-09-03 21:25:58
5916,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_3,"I didn't take sides, I just wanted some peace and quiet.",2024-09-03 21:27:58
5917,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,"This is supposed to be fun, why are you both ruining it for me?",2024-09-03 21:33:58
5918,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,Ruining it for you? What about us? It's not all about you!,2024-09-03 21:34:58
5919,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_3,"Seriously, can't we just come up with a system or something?",2024-09-03 21:40:58
5920,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,Like what? You two are impossible to deal with.,2024-09-03 21:46:58
5921,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"Oh, now we're impossible? Says the guy who throws a fit every time he loses.",2024-09-03 21:54:58
5922,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_3,"Maybe if everyone got equal time, we wouldn't be arguing right now.",2024-09-03 22:02:58
5923,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,"Ok fine, let's time it, but next time don't just turn off the game when it's not your turn!",2024-09-03 22:11:58
5924,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"Deal, but you need to stick to the time limit too.",2024-09-03 22:19:58
5925,escalatory_conversation_402,speaker_3,Agreed.,2024-09-03 22:25:58
5926,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,Why did you change the project design without consulting anyone?,2024-09-03 21:00:01
5927,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,Because your design was completely impractical and would have taken too long.,2024-09-03 21:02:01
5928,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,That's not your decision to make alone! We agreed on it as a team!,2024-09-03 21:09:01
5929,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,"Wait, are you guys telling me the design changed? I just finished all my tasks based on the original plan!",2024-09-03 21:10:01
5930,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,Then maybe you should have checked your messages more often. I sent an update last night.,2024-09-03 21:15:01
5931,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,Are you serious? You can’t expect everyone to just change their work overnight!,2024-09-03 21:17:01
5932,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,"Exactly, this is not just about you. Changing the design without consulting affects the whole team!",2024-09-03 21:18:01
5933,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to take charge since no one else was willing to make the tough decisions.",2024-09-03 21:28:01
5934,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,"That's not taking charge, that's being a dictator!",2024-09-03 21:33:01
5935,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,And now we’ve wasted so much time and effort. Who gave you the right to decide what's best for everyone?,2024-09-03 21:43:01
5936,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,I have more experience than both of you combined. I know what I'm doing.,2024-09-03 21:53:01
5937,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,Experience doesn't mean you can ignore our input. This is supposed to be a collaborative project.,2024-09-03 21:59:01
5938,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,"Exactly, and now we're behind schedule because of your unilateral decision.",2024-09-03 22:07:01
5939,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,"Maybe if you spent less time arguing and more time working, we wouldn't be behind schedule.",2024-09-03 22:09:01
5940,escalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,"Oh, so now this is",2024-09-03 22:19:01
5941,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,"Why is the chore schedule not done again, Emily?",2024-09-03 21:03:05
5942,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,"I was busy with schoolwork, Dad, and I told you I was swamped this week.",2024-09-03 21:10:05
5943,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,That’s not an excuse! We all have responsibilities. You’re not pulling your weight around here.,2024-09-03 21:16:05
5944,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,"Maybe if you helped out more, I wouldn’t have to pick up so much slack!",2024-09-03 21:18:05
5945,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_3,Can we please not have this argument again? We always end up yelling and nothing gets solved.,2024-09-03 21:19:05
5946,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, Lisa. This is between Emily and me.",2024-09-03 21:23:05
5947,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,"No, don’t drag her into this! The way you handle everything around here is unfair.",2024-09-03 21:29:05
5948,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,Unfair? You think it’s unfair to ask you to do your part?,2024-09-03 21:33:05
5949,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,It’s more than doing my part! It’s like you expect me to handle everything whenever Mom isn’t around.,2024-09-03 21:40:05
5950,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_3,"Dad, Emily has a point. The chores are split unevenly. We need a better system.",2024-09-03 21:50:05
5951,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,"You know what, I’m done talking about this. Do your chores or there will be consequences. End of discussion.",2024-09-03 21:54:05
5952,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,"Oh, that’s great! Just shut down the conversation instead of actually listening.",2024-09-03 22:02:05
5953,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,Because talking doesn’t seem to work with you! Every week it’s the same excuse after excuse.,2024-09-03 22:09:05
5954,escalatory_conversation_404,speaker_3,We need to find,2024-09-03 22:18:05
5955,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,Why didn't you finish your part of the project?,2024-09-03 21:01:09
5956,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,I had other things to do. You could have covered for me.,2024-09-03 21:06:09
5957,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,"I always end up covering for you! This is a group project, remember?",2024-09-03 21:14:09
5958,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,"Oh please, like your sections are that difficult. Anyone could do them.",2024-09-03 21:24:09
5959,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_3,"Hey, let's not go there. We need everyone's effort.",2024-09-03 21:33:09
5960,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one picking up all the slack.",2024-09-03 21:42:09
5961,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,"Maybe if someone wasn't such a control freak, everyone else would step up more.",2024-09-03 21:45:09
5962,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,Control freak? I'm just doing what needs to be done since you clearly can't handle it!,2024-09-03 21:49:09
5963,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_3,Can we focus on finishing this instead of attacking each other?,2024-09-03 21:56:09
5964,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,"Maybe if speaker_1 chilled out a bit, we could.",2024-09-03 22:03:09
5965,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,Why should I chill out when half the work isn't even done?,2024-09-03 22:09:09
5966,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,Because stressing out and yelling won't magically get it done either!,2024-09-03 22:10:09
5967,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_3,"Okay, this is getting us nowhere. How about we divide what's left and each finish our parts tonight?",2024-09-03 22:12:09
5968,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,"Fine, but if speaker_2 doesn't do their part this time, I'm done.",2024-09-03 22:20:09
5969,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,"I said I'll do it, alright? Just back off.",2024-09-03 22:28:09
5970,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_3,Let's just get this done so we can move forward. Agreed?,2024-09-03 22:31:09
5971,escalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,Ag,2024-09-03 22:35:09
5972,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,"You never follow the group project deadlines, Mike. Why can't you be more responsible?",2024-09-03 21:06:12
5973,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Lisa? I did my part; it's not my fault if you can't coordinate properly.",2024-09-03 21:12:12
5974,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_3,"Seriously, Mike? You've been slacking off since day one. We all see it.",2024-09-03 21:21:12
5975,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Jessica. Just because you and Lisa are control freaks doesn't mean everyone else is slacking off!",2024-09-03 21:24:12
5976,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_4,"Guys, we need to finish this presentation. Arguing won't help.",2024-09-03 21:32:12
5977,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,"No, Emma, we need to address this. Mike, your lack of effort is dragging us all down.",2024-09-03 21:42:12
5978,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"Dragging you down? I did the research for our last presentation, and no one thanked me for that!",2024-09-03 21:51:12
5979,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_3,Because you did it last minute and it was incomplete! We had to redo half of it.,2024-09-03 22:01:12
5980,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"Maybe if you all weren't so picky, it would have been fine.",2024-09-03 22:07:12
5981,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,"Picky? We want the project to be good, Mike, not just thrown together.",2024-09-03 22:14:12
5982,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"Well, maybe I wouldn't feel like throwing it together if you two stopped micromanaging every detail!",2024-09-03 22:22:12
5983,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_3,Micromanaging?! We wouldn't have to if you just did your part properly from the start!,2024-09-03 22:24:12
5984,escalatory_conversation_406,speaker_4,Can we please get back to the presentation? We're wasting time.,2024-09-03 22:30:12

5987,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,Unclear? I've been using the same format for years without any problems.,2024-09-03 21:17:15
5988,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,"Well, maybe it's time to update that format. We're not in the 90s anymore.",2024-09-03 21:25:15
5989,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,Excuse me? Are you questioning my methodology now?,2024-09-03 21:32:15
5990,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,I'm saying your approach is outdated. The error could've been avoided with clearer instructions.,2024-09-03 21:41:15
5991,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_3,Can we focus on solving the problem instead of blaming each other?,2024-09-03 21:45:15
5992,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Dr. Patel. You weren't the one who had to redo an entire week's worth of work.",2024-09-03 21:46:15
5993,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,And you think it was fun for me to spend all night trying to fix it?,2024-09-03 21:47:15
5994,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_3,Enough! Pointing fingers won't fix anything. We need a new protocol.,2024-09-03 21:55:15
5995,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,Fine. But Dr. Thomson needs to stick to the damn procedure.,2024-09-03 21:58:15
5996,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,"And you need to explain things better. We're a team, remember?",2024-09-03 22:00:15
5997,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_3,"If we don't figure this out, our grant is at risk. What do we do next?",2024-09-03 22:08:15
5998,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,I'll draft new guidelines. But they better be followed to the letter.,2024-09-03 22:14:15
5999,escalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,And I'll make sure to review your notes more carefully in the future.,2024-09-03 22:19:15
6000,escalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,Why did you delete my code without asking?,2024-09-03 21:05:18
6001,escalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,Because your code was making the system crash!,2024-09-03 21:13:18
6002,escalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,You could have at least told me first! I've been working on that for days.,2024-09-03 21:20:18
6003,escalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,And I've been working on fixing the mess your code made! We don't have time for hand-holding.,2024-09-03 21:28:18
6004,escalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,Mess? My implementation was the backbone of this project!,2024-09-03 21:29:18

6017,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,"I've been busy with other classes, Mia. You'd know that if you ever bothered to ask.",2024-09-03 21:12:21
6018,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_3,"That's no excuse, John. We're all busy, but we're still managing to contribute.",2024-09-03 21:13:21
6019,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Alex. You're not the one juggling a job and coursework.",2024-09-03 21:21:21
6020,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,"We get it, you're busy. But that doesn't mean you can just ignore our deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:27:21
6021,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,I'm not ignoring them! I'm trying my best here.,2024-09-03 21:35:21
6022,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_3,"If this is your best, then it's clearly not good enough.",2024-09-03 21:41:21
6023,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you guys weren’t so controlling, I’d have more room to contribute!",2024-09-03 21:50:21
6024,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,"We're not controlling, John. We just want to get a decent grade.",2024-09-03 21:59:21
6025,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_3,"Yeah, and right now, you're making that really hard.",2024-09-03 22:08:21
6026,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I should just do the whole thing myself since nothing I do is good enough for you.",2024-09-03 22:12:21
6027,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,"That's not what we're saying. We want a team effort, not you doing everything last minute.",2024-09-03 22:22:21
6028,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_3,"And right now, it feels like you're just along for the ride.",2024-09-03 22:27:21
6029,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,Maybe I just picked the wrong group.,2024-09-03 22:28:21
6030,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,Maybe you did if this is how you're going to behave.,2024-09-03 22:31:21
6031,escalatory_conversation_409,speaker_3,"Seriously, John",2024-09-03 22:41:21
6032,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,"Why did you mess up the presentation again, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:03:24
6033,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,"I didn't mess it up, Sarah. I just followed the script we all agreed on.",2024-09-03 21:04:24
6034,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,The script? You skipped entire sections and added irrelevant points!,2024-09-03 21:09:24
6035,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_3,Both of you calm down. Let's figure out what went wrong.,2024-09-03 21:10:24
6036,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,"It's not about calming down, Jamie. Alex ignored our planning session!",2024-09-03 21:19:24
6037,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,Ignored? I was the only one who stayed up to rehearse.,2024-09-03 21:24:24
6038,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_3,"This isn't helping. We need to find a solution, not blame each other.",2024-09-03 21:26:24
6039,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,How do we fix this if Alex can't stick to a plan?,2024-09-03 21:34:24
6040,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't change things last minute, we'd be fine!",2024-09-03 21:40:24
6041,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_3,Enough with the blaming. Let's think about the next steps.,2024-09-03 21:46:24
6042,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,Fine. But Alex needs to take responsibility.,2024-09-03 21:48:24
6043,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,Responsibility? How about some support instead of criticism?,2024-09-03 21:50:24
6044,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_3,We can't move forward if we keep pointing fingers.,2024-09-03 22:00:24
6045,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,We can't trust Alex with critical parts of the project if this happens again.,2024-09-03 22:03:24
6046,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,"Don't act like you're perfect, Sarah. Everyone makes mistakes.",2024-09-03 22:06:24
6047,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_3,Let's agree to review our parts thoroughly before presenting again.,2024-09-03 22:08:24
6048,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,Only if Alex sticks to the agreed plan.,2024-09-03 22:13:24
6049,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,And if Sarah stops micromanaging every little detail.,2024-09-03 22:17:24
6050,escalatory_conversation_410,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:26:24
6051,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"I told you that I needed that report on my desk by 10 AM, and it's already past noon. Why is it not done yet?",2024-09-03 21:01:27
6052,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"I had other urgent tasks to handle, things that were more critical than your report.",2024-09-03 21:11:27
6053,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,More critical? This report was supposed to go to the board. What's more critical than that?,2024-09-03 21:16:27
6054,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"Maybe if you communicated better, I would understand the priorities. You always dump things last minute.",2024-09-03 21:24:27
6055,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,Dump things last minute? I gave you three days' notice for this. What's your excuse this time?,2024-09-03 21:26:27
6056,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"Your so-called ""notice"" was buried under a heap of other requests. I'm not a machine, you know.",2024-09-03 21:35:27
6057,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"If you can't handle the workload, maybe you should rethink your position.",2024-09-03 21:38:27
6058,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,Are you threatening my job now? How professional of you.,2024-09-03 21:40:27
6059,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"It's not a threat. It's a fact. This delay is unacceptable, and your attitude isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:42:27
6060,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"My attitude? Maybe if you weren't breathing down my neck every second, things would get done faster.",2024-09-03 21:52:27
6061,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"Breathing down your neck? I'm trying to keep us on schedule. Clearly, that's not something you care about.",2024-09-03 21:55:27
6062,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"Oh, please. Don't make it sound like you have everything under control. Half the time, your plans are all over the place.",2024-09-03 21:57:27
6063,escalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,Maybe they wouldn't be,2024-09-03 21:59:27
6064,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball, Jamie. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:00:31
6065,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,"Are you serious, Alex? You were nowhere near an open spot. I had to take the shot!",2024-09-03 21:08:31
6066,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,Yet you missed it! We could've turned the game around if you'd just looked up!,2024-09-03 21:14:31
6067,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault we lost? Maybe if you played some defense, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:16:31
6068,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_3,"Can we cool it, guys? Blaming each other won't change the score.",2024-09-03 21:26:31
6069,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,"Shut it, Matt! You're not helping either. You missed more passes than anyone!",2024-09-03 21:29:31
6070,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,"Yeah, Matt, you were practically giving the ball away!",2024-09-03 21:32:31
6071,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_3,I'm not the only one here who's making mistakes. Both of you missed clear shots too.,2024-09-03 21:38:31
6072,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,At least I know when to pass! Jamie acts like he's the only one who can score!,2024-09-03 21:47:31
6073,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,Maybe because I have to carry the team all the time! No one else steps up!,2024-09-03 21:56:31
6074,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_3,"We're a team, Jamie. It's not on one person to win or lose the game.",2024-09-03 22:03:31
6075,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,It sure feels like it when he hogs the ball every play!,2024-09-03 22:04:31
6076,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,And it feels like no one else even wants to try half the time!,2024-09-03 22:09:31
6077,escalatory_conversation_412,speaker_3,"This isn't getting us anywhere. We need to figure out how to work together, not",2024-09-03 22:14:31
6078,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,Why didn't you finish the report? I was counting on you!,2024-09-03 21:07:34
6079,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,I had other priorities. It's not my problem if you can't manage your time.,2024-09-03 21:09:34
6080,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,Are you serious? This was a team effort. You can't just bail like that.,2024-09-03 21:10:34
6081,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, I'd be more inclined to help.",2024-09-03 21:13:34
6082,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,Control freak? I'm trying to keep us from failing!,2024-09-03 21:23:34
6083,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,"You think you're so perfect, but you make mistakes too!",2024-09-03 21:32:34
6084,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_3,What's going on here? Why are you two yelling in the office?,2024-09-03 21:35:34
6085,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,We're yelling because somebody refused to do their part of the project!,2024-09-03 21:44:34
6086,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,This is not just on me. You keep assigning tasks without any consultation!,2024-09-03 21:54:34
6087,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_3,"Alright, let's calm down and figure out what's really going on here.",2024-09-03 22:02:34
6088,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,There's nothing to figure out. It's clear who's dropping the ball.,2024-09-03 22:11:34
6089,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,Don't act like you're innocent. You didn't even give clear instructions!,2024-09-03 22:13:34
6090,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_3,"Enough. We need to find a solution, not escalate this further.",2024-09-03 22:16:34
6091,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,I'm done trying to fix this if no one else cares.,2024-09-03 22:17:34
6092,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,"Fine, go ahead and quit then. See if I care.",2024-09-03 22:23:34
6093,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_3,"If we don't pull together, we all fail. Can we at least agree on that?",2024-09-03 22:24:34
6094,escalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,I'll agree when people start doing their,2024-09-03 22:34:34
6095,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,Why did you change the project report without telling any of us?,2024-09-03 20:59:36
6096,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,Because it was full of mistakes. Someone had to fix it.,2024-09-03 21:05:36
6097,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_3,We had a meeting scheduled to discuss the changes. You should have waited.,2024-09-03 21:14:36
6098,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,I don't need a meeting to correct obvious errors. It was a waste of time.,2024-09-03 21:16:36
6099,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,That's not the point. We all worked on it together. You can't just override our work.,2024-09-03 21:21:36
6100,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if everyone paid more attention, I wouldn't have to clean up the mess.",2024-09-03 21:28:36
6101,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_3,Are you saying we don't know what we're doing? That's really condescending.,2024-09-03 21:34:36
6102,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"If the shoe fits, wear it. I'm tired of dragging you two along.",2024-09-03 21:40:36
6103,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,"Wow, that's rich coming from someone who missed the last two deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:48:36
6104,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,I had important commitments. Maybe you should get your priorities straight.,2024-09-03 21:58:36
6105,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_3,You can't keep using excuses for your failures while blaming us for everything.,2024-09-03 22:03:36
6106,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,I'm not making excuses. Maybe you should step up your game.,2024-09-03 22:13:36
6107,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,We're a team. This individualist attitude is exactly what's tearing us apart.,2024-09-03 22:21:36
6108,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"Maybe the team needs a wake-up call, then. Not everyone can handle the truth.",2024-09-03 22:28:36
6109,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_3,"The truth is, your arrogance is destroying our project. If you can't collaborate, maybe you should leave.",2024-09-03 22:38:36
6110,escalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"Fine,",2024-09-03 22:40:36
6111,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,Why did you go behind my back and change the project plan without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:07:39
6112,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,Because your plan was going to make us miss the deadline. I had to take action.,2024-09-03 21:10:39
6113,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,"Taking action is one thing, but completely overriding my decisions is another!",2024-09-03 21:17:39
6114,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,"Your decisions weren’t working. We needed a more efficient approach, and I found one.",2024-09-03 21:20:39
6115,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you need to calm down. We can sort this out without yelling.",2024-09-03 21:24:39
6116,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,"No, I want to know why my contributions are being undermined.",2024-09-03 21:30:39
6117,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,Maybe because your contributions were slowing us down.,2024-09-03 21:31:39
6118,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,That’s not fair. I had everything scheduled perfectly!,2024-09-03 21:32:39
6119,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,"Clearly not, or we wouldn’t be in this mess now, would we?",2024-09-03 21:38:39
6120,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. Let's focus on fixing the issue instead of blaming each other.",2024-09-03 21:48:39
6121,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,I would if someone could respect my input instead of just dismissing it.,2024-09-03 21:51:39
6122,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,"Respect is earned, and so far, you haven't done anything to earn mine.",2024-09-03 21:58:39
6123,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,That’s rich coming from someone who never listens to anyone else’s ideas!,2024-09-03 22:07:39
6124,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,Maybe your ideas aren’t worth listening to if they're going to jeopardize the project.,2024-09-03 22:09:39
6125,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_3,Enough! We need to collaborate if we want to get anything done.,2024-09-03 22:11:39
6126,escalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,Easy for you to say when you,2024-09-03 22:13:39
6127,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,"I can't believe you lost the blueprints, Sarah. Do you realize how much work went into those?",2024-09-03 20:59:42
6128,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's all my fault now? Maybe if you had been more organized, we wouldn't be in this mess, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:03:42
6129,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,"Don't put this on me. I entrusted you with something important, and you blew it.",2024-09-03 21:10:42
6130,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_3,"Guys, fighting isn't going to solve anything. We need to focus on recreating the blueprints before the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:16:42
6131,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Jane. You weren't the one being blamed here.",2024-09-03 21:24:42
6132,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,Because it's her fault too! She didn't double-check the files either. We're supposed to be a team!,2024-09-03 21:33:42
6133,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_3,And being a team means not playing the blame game. We've lost enough time already.,2024-09-03 21:41:42
6134,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,"Fine, but Mark, you're acting like you're the only one who cares about this project. It's getting old.",2024-09-03 21:43:42
6135,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,Maybe I'm acting like I care because I do! Unlike some of us who treat this like a side gig.,2024-09-03 21:49:42
6136,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,"Oh, right. Because you never make mistakes? Get off your high horse.",2024-09-03 21:56:42
6137,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_3,"Enough! This isn't helping. Mark, copying the blame won't fix it. Sarah, we just need to find a solution.",2024-09-03 21:58:42
6138,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,I'm just sick of always picking up the slack.,2024-09-03 22:02:42
6139,escalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,And I'm sick of always getting criticized. Count on someone,2024-09-03 22:12:42
6140,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting, Kevin?",2024-09-03 21:08:45
6141,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,"Oh please, Anna. Like you guys needed me there. You always take over anyway.",2024-09-03 21:12:45
6142,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,That's not the point! We all have to contribute equally. It's a group effort.,2024-09-03 21:16:45
6143,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,Group effort? You mean 'Anna's effort and the rest just follow her lead'?,2024-09-03 21:21:45
6144,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,That's unfair and you know it! I've always asked for everyone's input.,2024-09-03 21:26:45
6145,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_3,Can we just calm down? We need to get this project done.,2024-09-03 21:30:45
6146,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Mark. You haven't been overshadowed by Anna all semester.",2024-09-03 21:38:45
6147,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,That's not what this is about! It's about reliability. You're constantly missing meetings.,2024-09-03 21:48:45
6148,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,Maybe I don't want to be micro-managed. Ever thought of that?,2024-09-03 21:51:45
6149,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"Maybe if you showed some initiative, I wouldn't have to!",2024-09-03 21:52:45
6150,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_3,"Seriously, we have a deadline. Can we focus on the project?",2024-09-03 21:59:45
6151,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,Why should I care if no one respects my ideas anyway?,2024-09-03 22:01:45
6152,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"We do respect your ideas, but you have to be present to share them!",2024-09-03 22:04:45
6153,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_3,"Enough, both of you! We're not getting anywhere like this.",2024-09-03 22:07:45
6154,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,"Fine, do whatever you want. I quit this group. Find someone else to boss around, Anna.",2024-09-03 22:14:45
6155,escalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"Kevin, that's not what anyone",2024-09-03 22:21:45
6156,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,Why did you change the project plan without discussing it with the team?,2024-09-03 20:59:48
6157,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"Because the original plan wasn't working, and we were running out of time!",2024-09-03 21:07:48
6158,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,That's not your call to make alone. We're supposed to be a team and make decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:10:48
6159,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to make a decision. You've been dragging your feet for days!",2024-09-03 21:17:48
6160,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you calm down. We need to figure out a solution, not fight about it.",2024-09-03 21:19:48
6161,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,"I'm calm, but it's frustrating when people go rogue and undermine the team.",2024-09-03 21:27:48
6162,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,Undermine? That's a bit dramatic. I was trying to save the project!,2024-09-03 21:29:48
6163,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_3,Can we just focus on what needs to be done now? Arguing isn't helping.,2024-09-03 21:31:48
6164,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,"Fine. But next time, don't assume you can make changes without consulting us first.",2024-09-03 21:33:48
6165,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"Next time, don't leave everything in limbo and maybe I won't have to.",2024-09-03 21:34:48
6166,escalatory_conversation_418,speaker_3,Enough. Let's get back to work and finish this project. We can address the process later.,2024-09-03 21:38:48
6167,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"Why is the design still not finished, Alex? We should have had this ready a week ago!",2024-09-03 21:05:51
6168,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,"I've been overloaded with work, Linda. It's not just this project I have to worry about.",2024-09-03 21:07:51
6169,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"That’s no excuse. We all have multiple projects. If you can’t handle the workload, say it upfront, and we can assign it to someone else.",2024-09-03 21:13:51
6170,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because it's so easy to just hand off projects last minute? Maybe if you gave clearer instructions from the start, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:23:51
6171,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"Clearer instructions? I laid out everything meticulously. Maybe if you paid more attention, you wouldn't be lagging behind.",2024-09-03 21:29:51
6172,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,Meticulously? There's nothing meticulous about dumping details in a three-page email and expecting magic to happen.,2024-09-03 21:32:51
6173,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"So, now it's my fault you can't organize your thoughts? Unbelievable.",2024-09-03 21:36:51
6174,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,"This isn't just about organizing thoughts, Linda. It's about teamwork. You act like you're above everyone and then wonder why projects fall apart.",2024-09-03 21:43:51
6175,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"Excuse me? I maintain the same expectations for everyone. If that’s too much for you, then maybe you’re the problem.",2024-09-03 21:44:51
6176,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,Why is it always someone's fault with you? Ever think about setting realistic deadlines? Or understanding people have limits?,2024-09-03 21:53:51
6177,escalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,I set deadlines based on the client’s needs. We can’t keep asking for,2024-09-03 21:59:51
6178,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the project deadline being moved up?,2024-09-03 21:06:55
6179,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,I thought you already knew. It was updated in the group chat.,2024-09-03 21:14:55
6180,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"No, it wasn't clear at all. We should have discussed it in person!",2024-09-03 21:20:55
6181,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_3,Can we just focus on getting the work done instead of playing the blame game?,2024-09-03 21:22:55
6182,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one who has to redo half of the work!",2024-09-03 21:26:55
6183,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,"You should have kept up with the chat, it's part of the team responsibilities.",2024-09-03 21:28:55
6184,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"And you should have made sure everyone was on the same page, especially with something this crucial!",2024-09-03 21:38:55
6185,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_3,"We're all stressed, but this arguing isn't helping us meet the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:48:55
6186,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,You're right about one thing—this arguing is a waste of time. But the miscommunication started with both of you!,2024-09-03 21:58:55
6187,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,Don't pin this all on us. We all have a role to play in team communication.,2024-09-03 21:59:55
6188,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_3,Can we at least split the remaining tasks so we can finish on time?,2024-09-03 22:07:55
6189,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"I guess we have no choice, but don't think this issue is resolved.",2024-09-03 22:16:55
6190,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,"Fine, let's just get this done, and we'll deal with our communication issues later.",2024-09-03 22:17:55
6191,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_3,"Alright, I'll handle the presentation slides. Who’s going to update the report?",2024-09-03 22:18:55
6192,escalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"I’ll update the report, but",2024-09-03 22:20:55
6193,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for rehearsal again, Jake.",2024-09-03 20:59:58
6194,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Emily, I had other things to do.",2024-09-03 21:09:58
6195,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,"Other things to do? We're supposed to be a band, remember?",2024-09-03 21:11:58
6196,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_3,I agree with Emily. We can't keep missing practice and expect to be ready for the gig.,2024-09-03 21:16:58
6197,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"You think I don't know that, Sarah? My life doesn’t revolve around this band 24/7!",2024-09-03 21:25:58
6198,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,"Well, it should be a priority if you're serious about it!",2024-09-03 21:27:58
6199,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"You're not the boss of me, Emily! Stop acting like you run everything.",2024-09-03 21:35:58
6200,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_3,"No one's trying to boss you around, Jake. We just need commitment from everyone.",2024-09-03 21:37:58
6201,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"Funny coming from someone who missed last week's practice too, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:45:58
6202,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_3,"That was one time, and I gave notice in advance. You just don't show up without any heads-up.",2024-09-03 21:52:58
6203,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,This is exactly why we're falling apart. Nobody's taking this seriously anymore.,2024-09-03 21:58:58
6204,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"Oh, and it's all my fault now?",2024-09-03 21:59:58
6205,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,"If you're not interested, maybe you should just leave the band, Jake.",2024-09-03 22:02:58
6206,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,Maybe I will! I don't need this constant nagging.,2024-09-03 22:03:58
6207,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_3,Can we all just calm down and talk about this like adults?,2024-09-03 22:10:58
6208,escalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,"We tried talking, Sarah. It clearly doesn't",2024-09-03 22:14:58
6209,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,Why did you change the code without telling anyone?,2024-09-03 21:09:01
6210,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,"Because the old code wasn't working and we had a tight deadline, what's the big deal?",2024-09-03 21:17:01
6211,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,The big deal is you broke half the features that were already working!,2024-09-03 21:27:01
6212,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you wrote better code to begin with, I wouldn't have had to fix it.",2024-09-03 21:31:01
6213,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. Pointing fingers won't solve the issue.",2024-09-03 21:38:01
6214,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,Calm down? How can I calm down when all our progress is lost?,2024-09-03 21:48:01
6215,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,Stop acting like it's all my fault. Everyone is responsible for this project.,2024-09-03 21:57:01
6216,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_3,This back-and-forth isn't helping. We need to figure out how to quickly solve the issues.,2024-09-03 22:04:01
6217,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,We wouldn't be in this mess if there was better communication from everyone.,2024-09-03 22:06:01
6218,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,You’re acting like you're perfect. You've missed deadlines too!,2024-09-03 22:11:01
6219,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_3,"Enough! We need solutions, not more problems. Let's focus on fixing it.",2024-09-03 22:19:01
6220,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,"Fine. But next time, let's all agree on changes before they're made.",2024-09-03 22:26:01
6221,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,Agreed. But make sure your code doesn't need last-minute overhauls.,2024-09-03 22:28:01
6222,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_3,Can we all work together now? We still have a deadline to meet.,2024-09-03 22:37:01
6223,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's get back to work. But this conversation isn't over.",2024-09-03 22:46:01
6224,escalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,"Agreed, let's fix this first",2024-09-03 22:52:01
6225,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"You never stick to the game plan, John.",2024-09-03 21:06:03
6226,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault we lost?",2024-09-03 21:12:03
6227,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on what went wrong collectively, instead of pointing fingers?",2024-09-03 21:17:03
6228,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"No, this is on John. He keeps making these random plays that get us nowhere.",2024-09-03 21:23:03
6229,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,Random plays? I'm trying to improvise because your strategies never work!,2024-09-03 21:29:03
6230,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_4,Can both of you just chill out? This isn't helping.,2024-09-03 21:39:03
6231,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,Why should I chill out? We lost because of him.,2024-09-03 21:47:03
6232,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,You're not our coach! Stop acting like you run the team.,2024-09-03 21:51:03
6233,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_3,"Seriously, maybe we should talk about this with Coach instead of yelling at each other.",2024-09-03 21:57:03
6234,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"Maybe if you supported the team more, we'd have a chance!",2024-09-03 21:59:03
6235,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,"Maybe if your plans weren't so outdated, we'd win.",2024-09-03 22:02:03
6236,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_4,This is getting pointless. Let's just take a break and regroup.,2024-09-03 22:11:03
6237,escalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"Fine, whatever. But this isn't over.",2024-09-03 22:20:03
6238,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,Why didn't you finish the science project like you promised?,2024-09-03 21:01:06
6239,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"I had other homework, you know. You can't just dump everything on me.",2024-09-03 21:02:06
6240,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,We had an agreement. Now we're both going to fail because of you.,2024-09-03 21:07:06
6241,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"Excuse me? I did most of the work last time, remember? It's your turn.",2024-09-03 21:08:06
6242,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. We need to figure this out before tomorrow.",2024-09-03 21:12:06
6243,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,"Calm down? Easy for you to say, you haven't done anything either!",2024-09-03 21:14:06
6244,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_3,That's not true. I gathered all the research materials. You both are supposed to compile it.,2024-09-03 21:23:06
6245,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"Yeah, right. You gave us half-baked data and now expect us to fix everything.",2024-09-03 21:26:06
6246,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,"This isn't helping. We need a solution, not finger-pointing.",2024-09-03 21:31:06
6247,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_3,"Alright, fine. Let's break it down. What exactly is missing?",2024-09-03 21:33:06
6248,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"The whole analysis section, for starters. And the conclusion.",2024-09-03 21:39:06
6249,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,And don't forget the presentation slides. We planned those out weeks ago but no one touched them.,2024-09-03 21:42:06
6250,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_3,"Okay, I'll do the analysis. Can you two handle the conclusion and slides?",2024-09-03 21:49:06
6251,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,I'm not sure we can trust you to do it right after all this.,2024-09-03 21:53:06
6252,escalatory_conversation_424,speaker_3,And I'm not sure I can trust either of you to finish on time. But we don't have a choice,2024-09-03 21:55:06
6253,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,Why did you change the presentation slides without telling anyone?,2024-09-03 21:04:09
6254,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,"Because your slides were a mess, someone had to fix them.",2024-09-03 21:06:09
6255,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,That's not your call to make. We had agreed on a draft last week!,2024-09-03 21:07:09
6256,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,A draft that was outdated and boring. We needed something better.,2024-09-03 21:11:09
6257,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_3,Can we get back to the point? We're in this together; let's not forget that.,2024-09-03 21:16:09
6258,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,I can't just overlook that you undermined my work. We're supposed to be a team!,2024-09-03 21:24:09
6259,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,"A team needs results, not hand-holding. If you can't keep up, then step aside.",2024-09-03 21:25:09
6260,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_4,Enough! We're losing focus here. What's done is done—let's figure out how to merge our efforts.,2024-09-03 21:33:09
6261,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,Fine. But this can't happen again. We need clear communication.,2024-09-03 21:43:09
6262,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_3,"Agreed. Moving forward, let's set stricter guidelines for changes before our next meeting.",2024-09-03 21:50:09
6263,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,Whatever. Just make sure the guidelines allow for improvement.,2024-09-03 21:55:09
6264,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_4,"They will. But next time, we all need to sign off on any modifications beforehand.",2024-09-03 22:02:09
6265,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_3,Let's summarize what we have and make sure it's the best combo of both versions.,2024-09-03 22:07:09
6266,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,"Alright. But remember, respect has to go both ways.",2024-09-03 22:12:09
6267,escalatory_conversation_425,speaker_4,"Deal. Now, let's get back to work and make this presentation shine.",2024-09-03 22:14:09
6268,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Alex? I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:03:14
6269,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Mia, you know I had a better shot from my angle!",2024-09-03 21:13:14
6270,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_3,Both of you need to stop fighting. It’s not helping us win the game.,2024-09-03 21:23:14
6271,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,"Seriously, Sam? Alex keeps hogging the ball and we’re losing because of it!",2024-09-03 21:28:14
6272,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,"Hogging the ball? Maybe if your defense was better, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:34:14
6273,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_3,Can we focus on the strategy? Pointing fingers won't fix anything.,2024-09-03 21:36:14
6274,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,Strategy? How can we have a strategy when someone thinks they're a one-person team?,2024-09-03 21:38:14
6275,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,"You're just jealous because I'm actually scoring points, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 21:45:14
6276,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_3,This bickering isn't making us play any better. We need to work together.,2024-09-03 21:55:14
6277,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,Work together? That's rich coming from someone who’s always covering for Alex’s mistakes!,2024-09-03 22:00:14
6278,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,Maybe Sam covers for me because I actually put in the effort!,2024-09-03 22:10:14
6279,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_3,Enough! We’re going to lose if we keep tearing each other apart.,2024-09-03 22:19:14
6280,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,"Fine, but if Alex screws up again, I'm done.",2024-09-03 22:23:14
6281,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,"Don't worry, Mia, I won't need your help anyway.",2024-09-03 22:32:14
6282,escalatory_conversation_426,speaker_3,Can we just get back on the court and try to win this?,2024-09-03 22:37:14
6283,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the presentation, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:02:17
6284,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,"Oh, really, Sarah? Like you were perfect in your part? Please!",2024-09-03 21:05:17
6285,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,At least I was there! I can’t carry the whole team by myself!,2024-09-03 21:11:17
6286,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop it. We need to figure out what went wrong and fix it.",2024-09-03 21:20:17
6287,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,Fix it? How about fixing Sarah’s attitude of blaming others?,2024-09-03 21:28:17
6288,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,My attitude? You’re the one who didn't show up without any notice!,2024-09-03 21:37:17
6289,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_3,Can we at least understand why Mark couldn't make it?,2024-09-03 21:39:17
6290,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,"Yeah, because Sarah didn't remind me about the time change!",2024-09-03 21:42:17
6291,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,It's not my responsibility to babysit you. You had the schedule.,2024-09-03 21:50:17
6292,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_3,This is getting us nowhere. Let’s talk solutions.,2024-09-03 21:57:17
6293,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,Solutions? How about setting reminders that everyone agrees to?,2024-09-03 22:06:17
6294,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,Like that’s the real problem here. How about some personal responsibility?,2024-09-03 22:14:17
6295,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_3,Enough finger-pointing. We need to own our parts and improve communication.,2024-09-03 22:22:17
6296,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,"Fine, I’ll set my own reminders, but we all need to be clearer next time.",2024-09-03 22:31:17
6297,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,Agreed. I’ll make sure to communicate changes directly to everyone.,2024-09-03 22:36:17
6298,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_3,"Good, let’s focus on moving forward. We can’t afford another mess-up.",2024-09-03 22:42:17
6299,escalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,Alright,2024-09-03 22:48:17
6300,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,I can't believe you mixed up the ingredients! The whole batch is ruined!,2024-09-03 21:00:20
6301,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! You were supposed to triple-check the list. This isn’t just my fault!",2024-09-03 21:08:20
6302,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,Triple-check? You're the one who insisted on using that weird spice instead of vanilla!,2024-09-03 21:18:20
6303,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,"Weird spice? It's called saffron, and it adds depth to the flavor. Unlike your plain vanilla ideas.",2024-09-03 21:25:20
6304,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,"Well, your ""depth"" just cost us this week's sales! Customers expect consistency!",2024-09-03 21:28:20
6305,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,Consistency? Or boring predictability? We need to innovate if we want to stand out!,2024-09-03 21:34:20
6306,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,"Innovate? You mean sabotage! This isn’t some cooking show, it's our revenue on the line!",2024-09-03 21:42:20
6307,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,Sabotage? That's a bold accusation for someone who can’t even manage a proper inventory check!,2024-09-03 21:51:20
6308,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,"Maybe if you spent less time experimenting and more time following the recipes, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:58:20
6309,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,"And maybe if you weren't so stuck in your ways, we'd actually get somewhere with this bakery!",2024-09-03 22:04:20
6310,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,Don't you dare talk to me about progress! Your recklessness is destroying everything we've built!,2024-09-03 22:11:20
6311,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,"My recklessness? At least I take risks! Unlike you, hiding behind old methods and safe choices!",2024-09-03 22:13:20
6312,escalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,Safe choices that have kept us afloat! But maybe you don't care about that?,2024-09-03 22:20:20
6313,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,Why haven't you finished the project yet? The deadline is tomorrow!,2024-09-03 21:01:23
6314,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,"I've been working on it, but I can't do everything by myself.",2024-09-03 21:10:23
6315,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Maybe if you were more organized, we'd be done by now.",2024-09-03 21:20:23
6316,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_3,"Look, we all are responsible; let's just figure out what's left and get it done.",2024-09-03 21:25:23
6317,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,"I have been organized. I've had to pick up your slack, speaker_1!",2024-09-03 21:30:23
6318,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,Don't put this on me. I've been handling more tasks than any of you!,2024-09-03 21:36:23
6319,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_4,This fighting isn't helping. We need to divide the work right now.,2024-09-03 21:39:23
6320,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,I've been saying that from the start! But speaker_1's been too controlling.,2024-09-03 21:45:23
6321,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,Controlling? I took charge because nobody else stepped up!,2024-09-03 21:46:23
6322,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_3,Can we stop blaming each other? We still have time if we act now.,2024-09-03 21:55:23
6323,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_4,"Agreed. Speaker_1, what parts are you struggling with?",2024-09-03 22:04:23
6324,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,I'm struggling because I've had no support. Every idea I proposed was shot down.,2024-09-03 22:09:23
6325,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,Maybe because they weren't good ideas! You never listen to us!,2024-09-03 22:12:23
6326,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_4,Can we all just take a breath and assign tasks quickly?,2024-09-03 22:15:23
6327,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_3,"Yes, let's break this down. Who's doing what?",2024-09-03 22:16:23
6328,escalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,Fine. I'll finish the research. Are you happy now,2024-09-03 22:22:23
6329,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,"I can't believe you used my design for the project, knowing I was still working on it!",2024-09-03 21:07:26
6330,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! Your design was just sitting there. We needed something to show the client.",2024-09-03 21:11:26
6331,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,That doesn't give you the right to steal my work without asking me!,2024-09-03 21:14:26
6332,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,Steal? Get over yourself. You're always so slow. We couldn't wait forever.,2024-09-03 21:24:26
6333,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,Slow? I was making sure it was perfect! Unlike you rushing things and delivering half-baked ideas.,2024-09-03 21:28:26
6334,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,"Half-baked? Wow, at least I get things done. You'd probably still be nitpicking if it wasn't for me.",2024-09-03 21:33:26
6335,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,Maybe because I actually care about quality. You're reckless and it shows in your sloppy work.,2024-09-03 21:38:26
6336,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,Sloppy? Dare you to say that in front of the client. Let's see who they think is sloppy.,2024-09-03 21:41:26
6337,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,Fine! I will. But don't come running to me when they notice all the flaws.,2024-09-03 21:45:26
6338,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,Flaws! The only flaw is your inability to work efficiently. This isn't art class; it's business.,2024-09-03 21:55:26
6339,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,And business needs quality too. Just wait until they start complaining.,2024-09-03 22:04:26
6340,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,"You think clients have time to wait for your 'quality'? We need results, and we need them now.",2024-09-03 22:08:26
6341,escalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,Results without quality won't last. You can't build a reputation on speed alone.,2024-09-03 22:16:26
6342,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,Why did you take the last piece of pizza? You know I wanted it!,2024-09-03 21:04:29
6343,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! You already had three slices. You're being so greedy!",2024-09-03 21:10:29
6344,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,Greedy? That's rich coming from you! You always hog the snacks!,2024-09-03 21:16:29
6345,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,That's not true! Remember last week when you finished the entire bag of chips by yourself?,2024-09-03 21:19:29
6346,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,I said I was sorry for that! Can't you let it go?,2024-09-03 21:29:29
6347,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,It's not just about the chips. It's about you always doing this—never thinking about anyone else!,2024-09-03 21:35:29
6348,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,"Maybe if you spoke up once in a while, I wouldn't have to guess what you wanted!",2024-09-03 21:37:29
6349,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,Why should I have to speak up for basic consideration?,2024-09-03 21:47:29
6350,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,"Maybe because it's a shared apartment, and we should communicate better!",2024-09-03 21:48:29
6351,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it’s my fault we have bad communication?",2024-09-03 21:55:29
6352,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,I didn't say that! But you could try being less passive-aggressive.,2024-09-03 22:00:29
6353,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,Passive-aggressive? I'm stating facts! You're the one who needs to grow up!,2024-09-03 22:09:29
6354,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,And you're the one who needs to stop acting like a victim all the time!,2024-09-03 22:15:29
6355,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,This is pointless. You're impossible to talk to.,2024-09-03 22:16:29
6356,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,"Fine, walk away like you always do. Real mature.",2024-09-03 22:21:29
6357,escalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,"And you stay, yelling at walls. Guess we're both",2024-09-03 22:23:29
6358,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took the last slice of cake again, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:03:33
6359,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. It's just a slice of cake. Don't make it a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:05:33
6360,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,"It's always you, though. You never think about anyone else in this house!",2024-09-03 21:10:33
6361,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_3,"Seriously, can we just have one day without you two fighting over food?",2024-09-03 21:12:33
6362,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if Sarah wasn't so uptight about everything, we wouldn't have this problem.",2024-09-03 21:18:33
6363,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,Uptight? I just want you to consider others for once!,2024-09-03 21:27:33
6364,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,That's rich coming from you. Remember when you ate all my snacks last week?,2024-09-03 21:32:33
6365,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,That was one time! And I replaced them the next day.,2024-09-03 21:35:33
6366,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_3,"Guys, you're both acting like children. Can we move on already?",2024-09-03 21:45:33
6367,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one being accused constantly.",2024-09-03 21:55:33
6368,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,And you're not the one dealing with your selfishness day in and day out!,2024-09-03 22:00:33
6369,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_3,Why don't we just divide stuff up? Write our names on food if it's gonna be this way.,2024-09-03 22:08:33
6370,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,"Fine, but I bet Sarah will still find something to whine about.",2024-09-03 22:13:33
6371,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,"Maybe if you stop acting like a spoiled brat, I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 22:18:33
6372,escalatory_conversation_432,speaker_3,"Enough, both of you! This is ridiculous. We're supposed to be a family, not enemies over",2024-09-03 22:21:33
6373,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Jerry? We could have won the game if you had.",2024-09-03 21:03:37
6374,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Alex! You seriously think you're the only one who can score?",2024-09-03 21:06:37
6375,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,It's not about that! It's about teamwork! You always hog the ball!,2024-09-03 21:09:37
6376,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,Maybe it's because I don't trust your shitty passes. They always get intercepted!,2024-09-03 21:18:37
6377,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,"That's because you never give me a chance! Everyone sees it, Jerry. You're not a team player.",2024-09-03 21:22:37
6378,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,"And maybe everyone sees that you can't handle pressure, Alex! That's why I don't pass to you!",2024-09-03 21:28:37
6379,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously, this isn't helping. We're all on the same team here.",2024-09-03 21:33:37
6380,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, Chris. If Jerry actually cared about winning, he'd listen.",2024-09-03 21:41:37
6381,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,Don't tell Chris to stay out of it. Maybe he sees that you're just whining because you didn't get your way!,2024-09-03 21:44:37
6382,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_3,"Look, blaming each other won't change the fact that we lost.",2024-09-03 21:52:37
6383,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,We lost because of Jerry's ego!,2024-09-03 22:01:37
6384,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,My ego? At least I didn't freeze up every time I got the ball like you did.,2024-09-03 22:10:37
6385,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_3,This isn't the time for pointing fingers. We need to figure out how to fix this before the next game.,2024-09-03 22:19:37
6386,escalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,"Sure, easy for you to say when you’re not the one constantly ignored on the",2024-09-03 22:20:37
6387,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,Why are the accounts off by so much this month?,2024-09-03 21:09:40
6388,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,Don’t point fingers at me. You’re the one who finalized the numbers.,2024-09-03 21:15:40
6389,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,I finalized them based on your calculations!,2024-09-03 21:24:40
6390,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_3,Can both of you stop blaming each other and fix the issue?,2024-09-03 21:27:40
6391,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,Easy for you to say when you're not the one getting the backlash.,2024-09-03 21:28:40
6392,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,"Oh, sure, because you’re the only one who ever gets criticized around here.",2024-09-03 21:35:40
6393,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_3,Enough! This isn’t helping. We need to figure out where the error happened.,2024-09-03 21:44:40
6394,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,"Maybe if someone hadn’t missed the last three deadlines, we wouldn’t be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:45:40
6395,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,"You know what? I’m not going to sit here and take this. If you had more experience, you’d understand--",2024-09-03 21:49:40
6396,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,Experience? Ha! At least I double-check my work unlike some people.,2024-09-03 21:52:40
6397,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_3,"Focus, we need to stay on track and solve the issue, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 22:00:40
6398,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,"Fine, but the numbers aren’t adding up from last month’s report.",2024-09-03 22:08:40
6399,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,And I suppose that’s my fault too?,2024-09-03 22:13:40
6400,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,"You know what, maybe it is. Your method has been flawed from the start.",2024-09-03 22:20:40
6401,escalatory_conversation_434,speaker_3,Blaming each other isn’t going to fix anything. Let’s retrace the steps and correct the numbers.,2024-09-03 22:25:40
6402,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,Why did you change the design without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 21:02:43
6403,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,It was a necessary adjustment. The original wasn't going to work.,2024-09-03 21:04:43
6404,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,Necessary? We all agreed on the original design!,2024-09-03 21:07:43
6405,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_3,I didn't even know there was a change until this morning. What's going on?,2024-09-03 21:16:43
6406,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you all paid more attention to the client feedback, you would have seen the flaws.",2024-09-03 21:24:43
6407,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_3,That's not the point. Communication is key in a team. You can't just make decisions alone.,2024-09-03 21:32:43
6408,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,"Exactly! This is about trust and collaboration. We're a team, not a one-person show.",2024-09-03 21:37:43
6409,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,"I get it, but we were running out of time, and I had to act fast.",2024-09-03 21:40:43
6410,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,Fast doesn't mean you skip the whole team! That's not how we operate.,2024-09-03 21:42:43
6411,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_3,And what if your changes have issues? Now we're all responsible for something we didn't agree on.,2024-09-03 21:47:43
6412,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,"Then we deal with it as a team, just like everything else.",2024-09-03 21:48:43
6413,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,This pattern of making solo decisions has to stop. It's disrespectful to everyone's contributions.,2024-09-03 21:49:43
6414,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,"Maybe if everyone actually contributed timely solutions, I wouldn't have to act on my own.",2024-09-03 21:56:43
6415,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_3,That's unfair. We all put in our best efforts. This attitude of yours is what’s causing problems.,2024-09-03 22:01:43
6416,escalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,We’ve always valued teamwork here. If you can't,2024-09-03 22:03:43
6417,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,Why didn’t you tell me you were going to redesign the team’s website?,2024-09-03 21:02:46
6418,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,Because I didn’t think I needed your permission for everything.,2024-09-03 21:05:46
6419,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,It’s not about permission; it’s about communication.,2024-09-03 21:12:46
6420,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"Oh, like how you communicated with us before changing the project deadline last month?",2024-09-03 21:19:46
6421,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"That was different, and you know it. We were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:26:46
6422,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"And now we’re running out of audience because our site is outdated, but you wouldn’t know because you never listen to my ideas.",2024-09-03 21:36:46
6423,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"Maybe if your ideas were actually good and you consulted the team, we would listen.",2024-09-03 21:44:46
6424,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,The team? Or just you?,2024-09-03 21:45:46
6425,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"I represent the team’s interests. Unlike you, who seems to have a personal agenda.",2024-09-03 21:55:46
6426,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"Personal agenda? I’m trying to improve our work, but you’re too controlling to see that.",2024-09-03 21:58:46
6427,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,Controlling? Or actually organized and responsible?,2024-09-03 22:02:46
6428,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,Responsible? Let’s talk about how you missed the client meeting last week then.,2024-09-03 22:10:46
6429,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"I had an emergency, and everyone knew about it. Stop deflecting.",2024-09-03 22:17:46
6430,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,Deflecting? You’re the one who keeps shifting the blame instead of admitting any fault.,2024-09-03 22:18:46
6431,escalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,Fault? You have no idea how much I do behind the scenes to keep this project afloat.,2024-09-03 22:23:46
6432,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,You promised you'd handle the marketing strategy and now our launch date is ruined!,2024-09-03 21:06:49
6433,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,I never promised anything! You just assumed I'd do everything on my own.,2024-09-03 21:10:49
6434,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,That's not true and you know it. I've been relying on you to pull your weight.,2024-09-03 21:12:49
6435,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"Maybe if you communicated better, I wouldn't be left in the dark all the time.",2024-09-03 21:21:49
6436,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault that you can't manage your tasks? That's rich.",2024-09-03 21:29:49
6437,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,You always do this! Shift the blame when things go south.,2024-09-03 21:37:49
6438,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,I wouldn't have to if you took any responsibility for once.,2024-09-03 21:47:49
6439,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"I've done plenty, way more than you ever acknowledge.",2024-09-03 21:50:49
6440,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,Like what? Name one big contribution you've made recently.,2024-09-03 22:00:49
6441,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,How about all those sponsorship deals I secured? Or does that not count?,2024-09-03 22:09:49
6442,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,Sponsorship deals? Guess who had to follow up on all those because you never finished the paperwork?,2024-09-03 22:13:49
6443,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,That's because I was busy fixing the website you messed up!,2024-09-03 22:21:49
6444,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,"If your ""fixing"" means making it even less user-friendly, then sure.",2024-09-03 22:28:49
6445,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe if you hired competent developers instead of your friends, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 22:33:49
6446,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,"Don't you dare drag them into this. Unlike you, they actually do their job.",2024-09-03 22:41:49
6447,escalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"That's it, I've had enough",2024-09-03 22:47:49
6448,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,"Why can't you ever just stick to the plan, Josh?",2024-09-03 21:02:53
6449,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Mia? I followed the plan!",2024-09-03 21:03:53
6450,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,"No, you didn't! You went completely off course, AGAIN.",2024-09-03 21:13:53
6451,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"I made a few adjustments, calm down.",2024-09-03 21:18:53
6452,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,Adjustments? You completely ignored what we discussed in the meeting!,2024-09-03 21:20:53
6453,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"Maybe because your plan was flawed, ever think of that?",2024-09-03 21:26:53
6454,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,My plan wasn't flawed! You're just too stubborn to follow instructions!,2024-09-03 21:30:53
6455,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"Oh right, because you're the know-it-all who never makes mistakes, right?",2024-09-03 21:33:53
6456,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,At least I care about this project more than trying to show off!,2024-09-03 21:43:53
6457,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,Show off? I'm trying to save this project from your terrible planning!,2024-09-03 21:46:53
6458,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,"You know what, if you can't work as a team, then maybe you shouldn't be on this project.",2024-09-03 21:49:53
6459,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe I'll actually get something done without you dragging us down.,2024-09-03 21:56:53
6460,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,"Fine, go ahead, quit. We'll see how far you get on your own.",2024-09-03 22:03:53
6461,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"Don't worry, I won't need you to watch me fail. I've had enough of your micromanaging anyway.",2024-09-03 22:04:53
6462,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,"Good luck impressing anyone with your reckless decisions, Josh.",2024-09-03 22:09:53
6463,escalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"At least I make decisions, not just dictate orders like a tyrant.",2024-09-03 22:18:53
6464,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting last night?,2024-09-03 21:00:57
6465,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"I had other things to do. Besides, it's not like I was the only one missing.",2024-09-03 21:03:57
6466,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,"That's a lame excuse! We needed your input, and you knew that.",2024-09-03 21:07:57
6467,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"Oh, and your input is so indispensable? Get over yourself!",2024-09-03 21:14:57
6468,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,"It’s about teamwork, not my importance. You’re just not pulling your weight!",2024-09-03 21:18:57

6470,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_3,Can we focus on the project instead of attacking each other? We have a deadline!,2024-09-03 21:30:57
6471,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,It's hard to focus when someone doesn't even bother to show up!,2024-09-03 21:34:57
6472,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"Maybe if someone didn't dominate every meeting, more people would want to attend!",2024-09-03 21:40:57
6473,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_3,This is getting us nowhere. How about we all list what tasks are left?,2024-09-03 21:50:57
6474,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,Here's a task: how about everyone actually does their part?,2024-09-03 22:00:57
6475,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,And here's a task: how about you stop pretending you're the project leader?,2024-09-03 22:03:57
6476,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_3,Stop! We're all equal partners in this. Can we divide the tasks and move forward?,2024-09-03 22:13:57
6477,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,"Fine. But if someone bails again, we're going to have serious problems.",2024-09-03 22:22:57
6478,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"Don't worry, I'll show up. Just make sure there's actually something worth my time.",2024-09-03 22:26:57
6479,escalatory_conversation_439,speaker_3,This is the final,2024-09-03 22:34:57
6480,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,Why did you delete my files from the project folder without asking?,2024-09-03 21:06:00
6481,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,I didn’t think they were relevant anymore. We had already moved past that stage.,2024-09-03 21:13:00
6482,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,That’s ridiculous! You can’t just decide that on your own.,2024-09-03 21:17:00
6483,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to clean up the mess. You left everything in chaos.",2024-09-03 21:18:00
6484,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_3,"Both of you, this isn’t helping us finish the project. We need to focus.",2024-09-03 21:20:00
6485,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,Don’t try to play mediator. This is serious. My work is gone!,2024-09-03 21:25:00
6486,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,And my work gets buried under your clutter. It’s not fair to the rest of us.,2024-09-03 21:29:00
6487,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,Fair? How is deleting my files fair in any way?,2024-09-03 21:34:00
6488,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_3,Can we just figure out a way to organize the folder better so this doesn’t happen again?,2024-09-03 21:43:00
6489,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,"Maybe if speaker_1 paid more attention and didn’t dump everything in there, we wouldn’t need to.",2024-09-03 21:46:00
6490,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,"Maybe if speaker_2 didn’t act like the project dictator, we wouldn’t have this problem.",2024-09-03 21:52:00
6491,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_3,"Seriously, this is getting out of hand. We’re wasting time arguing.",2024-09-03 21:58:00
6492,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,Easy for you to say. You haven’t lost hours of work.,2024-09-03 22:00:00
6493,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,And you think my time is any less valuable?,2024-09-03 22:10:00
6494,escalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,"No, but that doesn’t give you the right to mess with my files",2024-09-03 22:11:00
6495,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up to the rehearsal yesterday, Lisa? We've got a major performance next week!",2024-09-03 21:05:03
6496,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework, Mark. I can't just drop everything for the band.",2024-09-03 21:11:03
6497,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,We all have homework! That's no excuse. Everyone else managed to show up.,2024-09-03 21:19:03
6498,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_3,"Seriously, Lisa, it's not fair to the rest of us. We're counting on you.",2024-09-03 21:20:03
6499,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"Look, I've got a lot on my plate right now. It's not just the band, okay?",2024-09-03 21:26:03
6500,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if you actually cared about the band, you'd prioritize it more.",2024-09-03 21:27:03
6501,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're questioning my commitment? I've been here just as long as you!",2024-09-03 21:33:03
6502,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just calm down and figure out a solution?",2024-09-03 21:39:03
6503,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,"No, we can't just sweep this under the rug. Lisa needs to know this isn't acceptable.",2024-09-03 21:43:03
6504,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"Seriously, Mark, you're blowing this way out of proportion. One missed rehearsal isn't the end of the world!",2024-09-03 21:45:03
6505,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_3,"But it's not just about one rehearsal, Lisa. It's about the principle.",2024-09-03 21:51:03
6506,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"So now you're both against me? Great, just great. Maybe I should just quit if I'm such a burden.",2024-09-03 22:00:03
6507,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,"Don't play the victim card. You know we need you, but we need you to be dependable too.",2024-09-03 22:01:03
6508,escalatory_conversation_441,speaker_3,"Lisa, we're not trying",2024-09-03 22:07:03
6509,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead with the design changes without consulting the team, Julia.",2024-09-03 21:09:06
6510,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,"Steve, we had a tight deadline! I couldn't wait for everyone's input.",2024-09-03 21:10:06
6511,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_3,"Julia, that's not an excuse. We all had ideas to contribute.",2024-09-03 21:19:06
6512,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,And most of them were impractical! I streamlined the process.,2024-09-03 21:22:06
6513,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,Streamlined? You mean you ignored everyone's suggestions and did what you wanted.,2024-09-03 21:32:06
6514,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,That's not fair. I made decisions that were best for the project.,2024-09-03 21:37:06
6515,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_3,Best for the project or best for you?,2024-09-03 21:43:06
6516,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,Are you seriously questioning my intentions now?,2024-09-03 21:45:06
6517,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,"I think we have every right to, given how you've sidelined us.",2024-09-03 21:49:06
6518,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_3,"This isn't the first time either, Julia. Remember the last project?",2024-09-03 21:54:06
6519,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,"That was a completely different situation, and you know it.",2024-09-03 22:00:06
6520,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,Different? It feels exactly the same. You don't trust our opinions.,2024-09-03 22:10:06
6521,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,"Fine, if you think you can do better, why don't you just take over?",2024-09-03 22:20:06
6522,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_3,Maybe that's what needs to happen. At least we would feel heard.,2024-09-03 22:26:06
6523,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,"Yes, because right now, we're just being bulldozed.",2024-09-03 22:36:06
6524,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,I don't need this! I'm doing my best to meet our goals.,2024-09-03 22:43:06
6525,escalatory_conversation_442,speaker_3,And alienating the team in the process isn't the way to do it,2024-09-03 22:47:06
6526,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,Why did you change the presentation slides without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:06:09
6527,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,Because your slides were all wrong! They were missing crucial data!,2024-09-03 21:07:09
6528,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,My slides were perfectly fine. We agreed on the information last week.,2024-09-03 21:09:09
6529,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,That was before I found more accurate statistics. You can't present outdated information!,2024-09-03 21:14:09
6530,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,"You should have consulted me before making changes. This is a team project, remember?",2024-09-03 21:20:09
6531,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,Consulted you? You were the one who skipped the last two meetings. How was I supposed to reach you?,2024-09-03 21:29:09
6532,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,Don't act like you're the only one working hard here. I had valid reasons for missing those meetings.,2024-09-03 21:34:09
6533,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,"Whatever your reasons were, it doesn't change the fact that your slides were subpar. I had to fix them.",2024-09-03 21:39:09
6534,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,Fix them? Or sabotage my work to make yourself look better?,2024-09-03 21:43:09
6535,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. Stop being so dramatic. I'm just trying to make sure we don't fail this presentation.",2024-09-03 21:53:09
6536,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,"If you cared about that, then you'd respect the process and communicate better. This isn't your solo project!",2024-09-03 22:01:09
6537,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,Respect the process? You mean like showing up and actually contributing instead of leaving everything to me?,2024-09-03 22:09:09
6538,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who went behind my back! You always have to control everything.,2024-09-03 22:15:09
6539,escalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,Maybe I control things because you're unreliable! This whole debate wouldn't happen if,2024-09-03 22:20:09
6540,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the band rehearsal yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:01:14
6541,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,I had other plans. It's not like we have a gig coming up soon.,2024-09-03 21:02:14
6542,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,Other plans? This is supposed to be a commitment!,2024-09-03 21:03:14
6543,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,"It's just a hobby, not a job.",2024-09-03 21:05:14
6544,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,"Maybe for you, but some of us take it seriously.",2024-09-03 21:11:14
6545,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,Seriously? You're acting like we're going to be the next big thing. Get real.,2024-09-03 21:15:14
6546,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,It's about respect for everyone's time and effort.,2024-09-03 21:23:14
6547,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,Respect? What about when you were late last week?,2024-09-03 21:31:14
6548,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,That was different. I had an emergency.,2024-09-03 21:39:14
6549,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,And I'm supposed to just believe that? You've got excuses too.,2024-09-03 21:49:14
6550,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,At least I communicated it! You just bailed without a word.,2024-09-03 21:54:14
6551,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Chill out.,2024-09-03 21:55:14
6552,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,It's a big deal when it affects everyone. We can't practice properly without all members.,2024-09-03 21:58:14
6553,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,Maybe you should find someone else then.,2024-09-03 22:03:14
6554,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,Maybe we will if you're going to keep blowing us off.,2024-09-03 22:13:14
6555,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,"Fine! If that's how you feel, then good luck finding another drummer.",2024-09-03 22:16:14
6556,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,Don't think we won't. You're not irreplaceable.,2024-09-03 22:23:14
6557,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,"Great, go ahead. I'll enjoy my extra free time.",2024-09-03 22:25:14
6558,escalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,Enjoy your free,2024-09-03 22:26:14
6559,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the deadline for the project?,2024-09-03 21:04:17
6560,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,I assumed you knew! It's your responsibility to keep track of these things.,2024-09-03 21:06:17
6561,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,Are you serious? You've been slacking off and now you're trying to pin this on me?,2024-09-03 21:08:17
6562,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,Slacking off? I've been doing my part while you just sit around criticizing everything I do!,2024-09-03 21:14:17
6563,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,"Criticizing? Maybe if you did something right, I wouldn't have to criticize.",2024-09-03 21:17:17
6564,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,"Right, like you're some perfect saint. You've made mistakes too, you know.",2024-09-03 21:26:17
6565,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,At least I own up to them. You just make excuses and blame others.,2024-09-03 21:33:17
6566,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,Excuses? I'm dealing with double the workload because you're incompetent!,2024-09-03 21:40:17
6567,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,Incompetent? Look who's talking. You've been coasting on my hard work.,2024-09-03 21:41:17
6568,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,Hard work? That's a laugh. Everyone knows you're just trying to look busy.,2024-09-03 21:49:17
6569,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,At least I'm proactive instead of being completely unreliable like you.,2024-09-03 21:52:17
6570,escalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,Unreliable? I've kept this project afloat while you've been dragging us down.,2024-09-03 22:01:17

6578,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,Improvements? You're the one who couldn't stick to the plan for more than a day!,2024-09-03 21:16:20
6579,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,Because your plan was a disaster from the start!,2024-09-03 21:23:20
6580,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"A disaster? At least I had a plan, unlike you.",2024-09-03 21:25:20
6581,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop it! We're supposed to be a team!",2024-09-03 21:29:20
6582,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,"Well, this ""team"" isn't working if we keep letting mistakes slide.",2024-09-03 21:32:20
6583,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"You were never a team player to begin with, just admit it.",2024-09-03 21:35:20
6584,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_3,This is not helping us fix anything!,2024-09-03 21:38:20
6585,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,Maybe we wouldn’t have to fix anything if you guys did your parts right!,2024-09-03 21:42:20
6586,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_4,Arguing isn't going to get us anywhere. We all screwed up. Can we focus on the solution?,2024-09-03 21:45:20
6587,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you didn't bear the brunt of this mess!",2024-09-03 21:49:20
6588,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,"Oh, now we’re assigning blame based on workload? Seriously?",2024-09-03 21:54:20
6589,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_4,Enough! We need to figure out our next steps before the deadline tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:03:20
6590,escalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,Our next step should be to get someone competent to lead this.,2024-09-03 22:11:20
6591,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't include my suggestions in the presentation.,2024-09-03 21:08:23
6592,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,"Your suggestions were completely impractical, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:10:23
6593,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,Impractical? They were the only ideas that could actually get us the results we need!,2024-09-03 21:11:23
6594,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,Oh really? Then why didn't anyone else support your suggestions during the team meeting?,2024-09-03 21:16:23
6595,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_3,"Guys, can we please not do this now? We still have to finalize the slides.",2024-09-03 21:26:23
6596,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,"See, even Alex thinks we should have included my ideas!",2024-09-03 21:34:23
6597,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,"No, Alex is just trying to avoid another one of your tantrums.",2024-09-03 21:36:23
6598,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,Tantrums? Are you serious? You're the one who always shuts down ideas that aren't yours!,2024-09-03 21:46:23
6599,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,Maybe because I actually care about what works instead of indulging every ridiculous suggestion.,2024-09-03 21:52:23
6600,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_3,"Seriously, we're running out of time. Can we focus on getting this done?",2024-09-03 22:02:23
6601,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,"Fine, but next time, don't expect me to stay silent when you bulldoze everyone's input.",2024-09-03 22:12:23
6602,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,I'd love to hear something worth considering for a change.,2024-09-03 22:14:23
6603,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_3,Enough! Let's just get this presentation done so we don't all fail.,2024-09-03 22:16:23
6604,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,"Whatever, just stay out of my way.",2024-09-03 22:21:23
6605,escalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,"Trust me, that's exactly what I intend to do.",2024-09-03 22:27:23
6606,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,"Why do you keep hogging the ball, Sam? We're losing because of you!",2024-09-03 21:05:26
6607,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault we're losing? Maybe if you could shoot, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:13:26
6608,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus? We need to come up with a strategy, not fight.",2024-09-03 21:23:26
6609,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,"Don't tell me to calm down, Alex! Sam is the one ruining this game for us.",2024-09-03 21:30:26
6610,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,"It’s not like you’re scoring any points either, John!",2024-09-03 21:32:26
6611,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_4,Enough already! We’re supposed to be a team. This arguing is making it worse.,2024-09-03 21:41:26
6612,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Mike. You haven't even touched the ball this whole game!",2024-09-03 21:48:26
6613,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_4,Maybe because you and Sam won’t pass it to anyone else!,2024-09-03 21:52:26
6614,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,"Oh, now I'm the only one who doesn't pass? I’ve seen you miss easy shots too, John.",2024-09-03 21:55:26
6615,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_3,"Seriously, we need to stop pointing fingers. We have a halftime break to figure this out.",2024-09-03 21:57:26
6616,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,There’s only one solution: Sam needs to pass the ball more!,2024-09-03 22:04:26
6617,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,And maybe you need to defend better instead of whining!,2024-09-03 22:07:26
6618,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_4,This is pointless. How are we supposed to fix anything if we’re busy blaming each other?,2024-09-03 22:13:26
6619,escalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,"I’m tired of this. If Sam doesn’t change, I’m done playing with you guys.",2024-09-03 22:17:26
6620,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,Why did you delete our code repository without telling anyone?,2024-09-03 21:03:30
6621,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,"I didn't delete it, I just moved it to a different server for better management.",2024-09-03 21:11:30
6622,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,Without informing the rest of the team? Do you know how much time we wasted looking for it?,2024-09-03 21:12:30
6623,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if more people were actually contributing, I wouldn't have had to take charge like that.",2024-09-03 21:21:30
6624,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_3,"This is not how leadership works, speaker_2. We all need to be in the loop on major changes.",2024-09-03 21:23:30
6625,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,Leadership? Please. You all complain about problems but never take any action.,2024-09-03 21:24:30
6626,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,"That's not fair. We've all been working hard, and you just act unilaterally.",2024-09-03 21:25:30
6627,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_3,Exactly. We had a system in place for a reason. You undermined it.,2024-09-03 21:30:30
6628,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,The system was slow and inefficient. I was trying to help us move faster.,2024-09-03 21:32:30
6629,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,Help? More like create chaos. We lost hours of work trying to find the repository.,2024-09-03 21:34:30
6630,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,Maybe you should have backed it up like you're supposed to.,2024-09-03 21:41:30
6631,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's our fault? How about you take some responsibility for once?",2024-09-03 21:43:30
6632,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_3,"Wait, calling each other out isn't helping. We need to figure out how to fix this.",2024-09-03 21:47:30
6633,escalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,"Fine. I'll move it back, but I'm telling you, we're going to run into the same issues",2024-09-03 21:55:30
6634,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up to the meeting, Anna? You knew how important it was.",2024-09-03 21:02:34
6635,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"Are you seriously asking me that, Mike? I had to complete the client report because you didn't do your part!",2024-09-03 21:05:34
6636,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,I sent you the data yesterday! It's not my fault if you didn't check your email on time.,2024-09-03 21:11:34
6637,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! You sent incomplete data, and you know it. Why do you think I had to stay late?",2024-09-03 21:17:34
6638,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"Maybe if you weren't always second-guessing everything, you'd be more efficient.",2024-09-03 21:25:34
6639,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,Excuse me? At least I care about the quality of our work. Unlike you.,2024-09-03 21:31:34
6640,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"Oh, so now I'm careless? That's a new low, even for you.",2024-09-03 21:39:34
6641,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"You know what, Mike? This isn't working. You're impossible to work with.",2024-09-03 21:46:34
6642,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"Funny, I was about to say the same thing about you. Maybe we should talk to Sarah about redistributing tasks.",2024-09-03 21:52:34
6643,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,Fine by me. But don’t expect me to cover for you anymore when things go wrong.,2024-09-03 21:53:34
6644,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"Oh, I won’t. I’ve had enough of picking up your slack anyway.",2024-09-03 21:54:34
6645,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,Unbelievable. Good luck managing without any support.,2024-09-03 22:02:34
6646,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,Same to you. Guess we'll see who really holds this team together.,2024-09-03 22:11:34
6647,escalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"Don't hold your breath, Mike.",2024-09-03 22:21:34
6648,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,You seriously think painting the entire mural without consulting us was a good idea?,2024-09-03 21:09:37
6649,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to get things moving. You all were dragging your feet.",2024-09-03 21:11:37
6650,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,Dragging our feet? We were planning it out carefully. You just took over like a dictator!,2024-09-03 21:15:37
6651,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_3,I’m with speaker_1 on this. We had a theme we all agreed on and you ignored it.,2024-09-03 21:20:37
6652,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. The theme was boring. What I did is way more dynamic and colorful.",2024-09-03 21:23:37
6653,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_4,"But it’s not just about your artistic vision. We’re a team, and you steamrolled us!",2024-09-03 21:28:37
6654,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,"If being a team means waiting forever for a decision, count me out!",2024-09-03 21:33:37
6655,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,"Fine, then maybe you shouldn’t be part of this project at all!",2024-09-03 21:35:37
6656,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_3,"Agreed. You overstepped, and now the mural doesn’t represent any of us.",2024-09-03 21:36:37
6657,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,You're all just upset because I took action. At least I did something.,2024-09-03 21:45:37
6658,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_4,Something that none of us wanted. It’s not a solo project!,2024-09-03 21:51:37
6659,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,"Whatever. You all can take your sweet time, but I’m done waiting.",2024-09-03 21:54:37
6660,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,Done waiting? We now have to figure out how to fix the mess you created!,2024-09-03 22:01:37
6661,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_3,You know what? Maybe the school principal needs to hear about this.,2024-09-03 22:10:37
6662,escalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,Go,2024-09-03 22:19:37
6663,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,Why didn't you finish the project report on time? We've been waiting on you.,2024-09-03 21:10:41
6664,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,I had other urgent things to do. You're acting like it's all on me.,2024-09-03 21:18:41
6665,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,We divided this up weeks ago! You knew this was your responsibility.,2024-09-03 21:23:41
6666,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,And I worked on my part. Maybe you should check if your instructions were clear enough.,2024-09-03 21:31:41
6667,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,Don't you dare put this on us. The email was crystal clear.,2024-09-03 21:33:41
6668,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,Now our whole team's behind because of you!,2024-09-03 21:40:41
6669,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,"Oh, so it's suddenly my fault that the team can't function without me? Grow up!",2024-09-03 21:50:41
6670,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,This isn't the first time you've dropped the ball. We're tired of covering for you.,2024-09-03 21:58:41
6671,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,"Every single time, there's some excuse. We're not buying it anymore.",2024-09-03 22:08:41
6672,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,"Fine, if you think you can do better without me, why don't you just finish it yourselves?",2024-09-03 22:16:41
6673,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,Maybe that's exactly what needs to happen. We shouldn't have to pick up your slack.,2024-09-03 22:23:41
6674,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,"If you don't want to contribute, just say so. Stop wasting everyone's time.",2024-09-03 22:24:41
6675,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,You know what? I don't need this. I'm out. Good luck handling it without me.,2024-09-03 22:26:41
6676,escalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,"Finally, something we agree on. Goodbye.",2024-09-03 22:33:41
6677,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,Why did you take my design without asking?,2024-09-03 21:04:45
6678,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I just borrowed it for the presentation.,2024-09-03 21:10:45
6679,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,Borrowed? You presented it as your own!,2024-09-03 21:20:45
6680,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,I did all the tweaks myself. You didn't even finish it.,2024-09-03 21:26:45
6681,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,Tweaks? You changed two colors and called it your work!,2024-09-03 21:35:45
6682,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,You always act like your ideas are the only ones that matter.,2024-09-03 21:38:45
6683,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,Because I actually put in the time! You just swoop in last minute.,2024-09-03 21:40:45
6684,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, we could collaborate better.",2024-09-03 21:47:45
6685,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"Oh right, it's my fault you can't respect boundaries.",2024-09-03 21:48:45
6686,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,"Boundaries? Seriously, in a group project?",2024-09-03 21:50:45
6687,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"Yes, in a group project! We have to respect each other's contributions.",2024-09-03 21:59:45
6688,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,Respect? You never respect anyone's input unless you approve it.,2024-09-03 22:01:45
6689,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"That's because most of the input is half-baked, just like yours.",2024-09-03 22:05:45
6690,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,"If you hate my work so much, why don't you just do everything yourself then?",2024-09-03 22:11:45
6691,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,Maybe I should! At least it would be done right!,2024-09-03 22:19:45
6692,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,You really think you're the only one capable here?,2024-09-03 22:29:45
6693,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"At this rate, it feels like it.",2024-09-03 22:30:45
6694,escalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,You're impossible to work with. No wonder everyone avoids you.,2024-09-03 22:39:45
6695,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,"You missed another practice, Matt. This is getting out of hand.",2024-09-03 21:09:49
6696,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,"I told you, Coach, I had a family emergency. It's not like I wanted to miss it.",2024-09-03 21:19:49
6697,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,You always have an excuse. The team's performance is suffering because of your absences.,2024-09-03 21:24:49
6698,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,That's not fair! I put in double the effort when I'm here. Maybe the team's performance is suffering because of your outdated strategies.,2024-09-03 21:33:49
6699,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,"Outdated strategies? I've been coaching this team for five years, and we've always done well until now.",2024-09-03 21:36:49
6700,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,"Maybe that's the problem. We've been doing the same drills, facing the same tactics. Opponents know how to beat us.",2024-09-03 21:39:49
6701,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,"So now you're an expert in coaching? Fine, why don't you run the next practice and show us all how it's done?",2024-09-03 21:40:49
6702,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,"Maybe I will! At least I'll try something new, instead of sticking to your rigid playbook.",2024-09-03 21:48:49
6703,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,This isn't about the playbook. This is about commitment. You're letting the whole team down.,2024-09-03 21:54:49
6704,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,And you're not listening to anyone but yourself! No wonder morale is low.,2024-09-03 21:58:49
6705,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,Morale was fine before you started skipping practices. You're the one affecting the team spirit.,2024-09-03 22:02:49
6706,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,Or maybe morale was low because we're stuck in a rut and no one feels heard. This isn't just on me.,2024-09-03 22:12:49
6707,escalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,I listen to,2024-09-03 22:21:49
6708,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,"Why did you touch my project without asking, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:06:52
6709,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, Sarah. I was just trying to help.",2024-09-03 21:07:52
6710,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,Help? You completely messed up my design! Now I have to redo everything.,2024-09-03 21:15:52
6711,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,"Oh come on, it wasn't that bad. You're just overreacting.",2024-09-03 21:25:52
6712,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,Overreacting? This project is worth half our grade!,2024-09-03 21:28:52
6713,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,"Well, maybe you should've done a better job in the first place if you're so worried about the grade.",2024-09-03 21:32:52
6714,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,That’s rich coming from someone who barely contributed until now!,2024-09-03 21:33:52
6715,escalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,Excuse me? I've been pulling my weight. Just because I didn't work exactly the way you wanted doesn't mean I didn't help.,2024-09-03 21:37:52

6742,escalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,Unnecessary? Those graphs were crucial for our analysis! You can't just dismiss my work like that.,2024-09-03 21:50:58
6743,escalatory_conversation_457,speaker_2,Your work? Seriously? I did most of the research while you were obsessing over details no one cares about.,2024-09-03 21:54:58
6744,escalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,Obsessing? I'm trying to bring quality to this project. Maybe you should try it sometime!,2024-09-03 21:59:58

6752,escalatory_conversation_458,speaker_1,Fair game? That data was part of my final thesis! You knew that.,2024-09-03 21:10:02

6755,escalatory_conversation_458,speaker_2,You’re overreacting. You can just collect new samples. Relax.,2024-09-03 21:23:02

6780,escalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,Are you serious? We've wasted enough time. Someone had to take action.,2024-09-03 21:14:09

6786,escalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,Errors? You mean your excessive nitpicking and delays? We need timely results!,2024-09-03 21:49:09

6803,escalatory_conversation_461,speaker_1,The principle? Give me a break. You just want to do whatever you want without considering others.,2024-09-03 21:54:12

6837,escalatory_conversation_464,speaker_2,I had a lot of other things to do. It's not like I'm the only one who missed it.,2024-09-03 21:11:22

6855,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,That's different. I always return your things in the same condition.,2024-09-03 21:26:26
6856,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,So you're saying I damaged your car? Stop exaggerating!,2024-09-03 21:35:26
6857,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. Let's discuss this without yelling.,2024-09-03 21:39:26
6858,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,"Look, it's about respect. How can I trust you if you keep doing this?",2024-09-03 21:48:26
6859,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,Trust? You're one to talk. Remember when you crashed my bike and didn't even apologize?,2024-09-03 21:54:26
6860,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_3,We’re going in circles. Can we focus on finding a solution?,2024-09-03 21:58:26
6861,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,The solution is simple: don't touch my car without permission!,2024-09-03 22:08:26
6862,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,"Fine, but you better stop touching my stuff too.",2024-09-03 22:14:26
6863,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_3,Can we agree to leave each other’s things alone from now on?,2024-09-03 22:18:26
6864,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,Only if you can actually follow through.,2024-09-03 22:19:26
6865,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,Same goes to you. Deal?,2024-09-03 22:20:26
6866,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_3,Are we all on the same page now?,2024-09-03 22:30:26
6867,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,"Reluctantly, yes.",2024-09-03 22:36:26
6868,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,"Fine, agreed.",2024-09-03 22:37:26
6869,escalatory_conversation_465,speaker_3,Good. Let’s all try to be more considerate moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:44:26
6870,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the band rehearsal yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:04:30
6871,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,I had other things to do. It's not like you do everything perfectly all the time.,2024-09-03 21:09:30
6872,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"That's not the point, you committed to being there!",2024-09-03 21:18:30
6873,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,"Oh please, it's not like missing one rehearsal will make us sound terrible.",2024-09-03 21:23:30
6874,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_3,"Actually, it does affect us. We had to redo several parts because you weren't there.",2024-09-03 21:26:30
6875,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,"So what, you guys should've been able to handle it. Stop blaming me for everything.",2024-09-03 21:33:30
6876,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"It's about being responsible to your commitments. We all have busy lives, but we show up.",2024-09-03 21:34:30
6877,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,You act like I'm the only one who's ever missed a practice. Get off my back.,2024-09-03 21:38:30
6878,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_3,"We're not saying you're the only one, but it's a pattern with you. It's frustrating for the rest of us.",2024-09-03 21:47:30
6879,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,"Well maybe I'm frustrated too, but no one ever asks about that, do they?",2024-09-03 21:57:30
6880,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"We're trying to make this band work, but it's impossible with these constant disruptions.",2024-09-03 22:07:30
6881,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_3,"If you have issues, why not bring them up instead of just bailing?",2024-09-03 22:14:30
6882,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,"Because every time I try, you both just gang up on me. So why bother?",2024-09-03 22:16:30
6883,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"Maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 22:22:30
6884,escalatory_conversation_466,speaker_3,"Exactly, we could fix things if you'd",2024-09-03 22:26:30
6885,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,"Why did you touch my research project, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:09:33
6886,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,"I needed some data for my own project, and yours was just lying there, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:13:33
6887,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,That data is confidential; you could've asked first!,2024-09-03 21:16:33
6888,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,Seriously? You act like you own everything in the lab.,2024-09-03 21:18:33
6889,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,It's called respect for someone's work! Not everything revolves around what you need.,2024-09-03 21:28:33
6890,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,Respect? Coming from someone who never shares resources properly?,2024-09-03 21:32:33
6891,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault that you can't manage your own project deadlines?",2024-09-03 21:40:33
6892,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,"If you weren't so territorial, maybe the lab would function better!",2024-09-03 21:41:33
6893,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,Territorial? I'm trying to protect the integrity of my research!,2024-09-03 21:50:33
6894,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,By hoarding everything and making it harder for everyone else?,2024-09-03 21:53:33
6895,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,"That's a ridiculous excuse, and you know it! What if you messed up my data?",2024-09-03 21:55:33
6896,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,"I was careful, unlike you who never follows proper procedures.",2024-09-03 22:04:33
6897,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,Don't you dare lecture me about procedures! You bypassed security protocols without a second thought.,2024-09-03 22:05:33
6898,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,"Maybe because those protocols are outdated, just like your stubborn mindset!",2024-09-03 22:10:33
6899,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,Outdated? That's rich coming from someone who hasn't even published a single paper!,2024-09-03 22:16:33
6900,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,Publications aren't everything! At least I'm trying to innovate rather than sticking to your dusty methods.,2024-09-03 22:19:33
6901,escalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,Innovate? More like cutting corners,2024-09-03 22:20:33
6902,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my code without asking, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:03:37
6903,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,"Because it was full of bugs, Mark! We needed something functional before the presentation.",2024-09-03 21:10:37
6904,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,You should have at least let me fix it. Now I have to start from scratch!,2024-09-03 21:14:37
6905,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,"We don't have time for you to fix things. We need results now, and your code was slowing us down.",2024-09-03 21:24:37
6906,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,That's not fair! Everyone’s code has bugs. Why single out mine?,2024-09-03 21:30:37
6907,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,Because your bugs were causing the entire system to crash! We can't afford that.,2024-09-03 21:31:37
6908,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_3,Could both of you stop shouting? We need to focus on getting this project finished.,2024-09-03 21:40:37
6909,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,"It's easy for you to say, Julie. You're not the one whose work got erased.",2024-09-03 21:41:37
6910,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_3,"We're all under pressure, Mark. Arguing isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:45:37
6911,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,"Exactly. We need to cooperate, not fight over whose fault it is.",2024-09-03 21:49:37
6912,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,Cooperation shouldn’t mean unilaterally deleting someone’s hard work!,2024-09-03 21:56:37
6913,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,It also shouldn’t mean compromising the entire project with unstable code!,2024-09-03 22:00:37
6914,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_3,This back-and-forth is wasting more time than fixing the code. Can we at least try to assign tasks and move forward?,2024-09-03 22:05:37
6915,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,"Fine. But if something like this happens again, we need to have a proper discussion first.",2024-09-03 22:08:37
6916,escalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,Agreed. But make,2024-09-03 22:13:37
6917,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,Why did you go ahead and approve those expenses without consulting any of us?,2024-09-03 21:05:41
6918,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,"Because it was urgent, and you were all unavailable! Someone had to make a decision.",2024-09-03 21:13:41
6919,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,"That's not an excuse, speaker_2. You could have at least sent a message informing us beforehand.",2024-09-03 21:14:41
6920,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. Let's figure out how it happened. speaker_2, what made it so urgent?",2024-09-03 21:15:41
6921,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,The vendor was threatening to cut off our supplies. I didn't have a choice!,2024-09-03 21:22:41
6922,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,But now the budget is a mess! We're all going to have to make cuts because of your rash decision.,2024-09-03 21:28:41
6923,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_4,This is getting out of hand. We should've had a plan for emergencies like this. Why didn't we?,2024-09-03 21:37:41
6924,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,"Don't try to deflect blame now, speaker_4. You were the one who was supposed to create that plan!",2024-09-03 21:46:41
6925,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_4,I was given conflicting priorities! You all couldn't agree on what I should focus on first.,2024-09-03 21:54:41
6926,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_3,We're just going in circles. Can we talk about solutions instead of assigning blame?,2024-09-03 21:55:41
6927,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,The solution is clear: speaker_2 needs to own up and fix this mess.,2024-09-03 21:57:41
6928,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,"Fine, I'll talk to the vendor and see if we can renegotiate. But I still think I did the right thing given the circumstances.",2024-09-03 22:07:41
6929,escalatory_conversation_469,speaker_3,At least that's a start. Moving,2024-09-03 22:09:41
6930,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,"I can't believe you're late again, Emily! We've already missed the start of the game!",2024-09-03 21:08:44
6931,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, John. It's just a few minutes. The game isn't won or lost in the first five minutes.",2024-09-03 21:12:44
6932,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,That's not the point. We made a commitment to be there on time. It's about respect for the team.,2024-09-03 21:20:44
6933,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. We're all here now. Let's just get focused on playing.",2024-09-03 21:23:44
6934,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Mike. You're not the one being dragged over the coals every single time.",2024-09-03 21:30:44
6935,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,"And you're not the one who takes this seriously, Emily. You're always late, and it's affecting the team.",2024-09-03 21:34:44
6936,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so uptight, people might actually enjoy playing with you.",2024-09-03 21:44:44
6937,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,Oh really? So now it's my fault that you're inconsiderate? Unbelievable.,2024-09-03 21:48:44
6938,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_3,"Enough! This isn't helping anyone. We need to focus on the game, not each other.",2024-09-03 21:57:44
6939,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,Focus on the game? Hard to do when someone’s always nitpicking every little thing.,2024-09-03 22:01:44
6940,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,I wouldn't have to nitpick if you just showed some responsibility for once.,2024-09-03 22:02:44
6941,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"Responsibility? You're acting like this is the World Cup. It's a rec league, John.",2024-09-03 22:04:44
6942,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,"Exactly, and even a rec league deserves our effort and respect.",2024-09-03 22:06:44
6943,escalatory_conversation_470,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:13:44
6944,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back like that, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:09:47
6945,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Jack. It was just a small project. You’re overreacting.",2024-09-03 21:16:47
6946,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,Overreacting? You submitted my work as your own!,2024-09-03 21:17:47
6947,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"I enhanced it, and you were taking too long anyway.",2024-09-03 21:19:47
6948,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,I was being thorough. Quality takes time.,2024-09-03 21:25:47
6949,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"Well, at least my version didn't get rejected by the client.",2024-09-03 21:31:47
6950,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,That’s because you didn’t even ask for my input! You just changed everything!,2024-09-03 21:39:47
6951,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,I made it better. Deal with it.,2024-09-03 21:43:47
6952,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,How can I deal with it? You made me look incompetent in front of everyone.,2024-09-03 21:44:47
6953,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so slow, we wouldn't have these issues.",2024-09-03 21:49:47
6954,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,Really? So now it's my fault that you couldn't even communicate properly?,2024-09-03 21:50:47
6955,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,Communicate properly? I saved us from missing the deadline!,2024-09-03 21:55:47
6956,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,By throwing me under the bus?,2024-09-03 22:02:47
6957,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"If you want to put it that way, fine. At least the client is happy.",2024-09-03 22:03:47
6958,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,"The client might be, but our trust is broken, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:12:47
6959,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,Trust? You think I can trust you with deadlines anymore?,2024-09-03 22:15:47
6960,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,And you think I can trust you to respect my work?,2024-09-03 22:25:47
6961,escalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,Maybe we should stop working,2024-09-03 22:26:47
6962,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,I can't believe you just took the last piece of cake without even asking!,2024-09-03 21:10:51
6963,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, it's just a piece of cake. Why are you getting so bent out of shape?",2024-09-03 21:17:51
6964,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,Because you always do this! You never consider anyone else. It's infuriating!,2024-09-03 21:23:51
6965,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because you're Miss Perfect and always think of others. Give me a break!",2024-09-03 21:27:51
6966,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_3,"Hey, can you two stop yelling? We're roommates, not enemies.",2024-09-03 21:36:51
6967,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, speaker_3. You know speaker_2 always acts selfishly.",2024-09-03 21:43:51
6968,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,I'm selfish? You're the one who blew up over nothing!,2024-09-03 21:49:51
6969,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_3,"Seriously, this is ridiculous. It's a piece of cake, not the end of the world.",2024-09-03 21:57:51
6970,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,It's the principle of the matter. It's about respect and consideration.,2024-09-03 22:01:51
6971,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,Respect? You mean like when you borrowed my headphones and never returned them?,2024-09-03 22:09:51
6972,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,That was different! I was going to give them back!,2024-09-03 22:17:51
6973,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,Sure you were. And now you’re making a big deal over cake just to flip the script.,2024-09-03 22:24:51
6974,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_3,Enough! We need to find a way to talk this out without shouting and accusations.,2024-09-03 22:34:51
6975,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,"Fine, then. Let's talk. Why do you always think it's okay to take without asking?",2024-09-03 22:36:51
6976,escalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,Maybe because I've lived with you two,2024-09-03 22:41:51
6977,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,"Why didn't you finish your part of the project, Tina? We were supposed to present today!",2024-09-03 21:02:54
6978,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,"I told you, Max! I had too much on my plate. You're always pushing everything onto me!",2024-09-03 21:07:54
6979,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,That's not true and you know it. You didn’t even tell me you were struggling. Now we both look unprepared!,2024-09-03 21:12:54
6980,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you actually stepped up for once, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:14:54
6981,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,Are you kidding me? I've been doing all the research and you were just supposed to organize the slides!,2024-09-03 21:21:54
6982,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,Organize the slides?! You left out half the data! It’s impossible to make sense of your notes.,2024-09-03 21:28:54
6983,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,"If you had read through them earlier instead of waiting until last night, you could have told me what you needed!",2024-09-03 21:30:54
6984,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,I wouldn't have had to wait if you had given me proper materials on time!,2024-09-03 21:33:54
6985,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,"This isn't just on me, Tina. We're a team, and you failed to communicate!",2024-09-03 21:37:54
6986,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,Maybe I just can't work with someone who doesn't take responsibility for their mistakes!,2024-09-03 21:42:54
6987,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it’s all my fault? You really think you're blameless here?",2024-09-03 21:45:54
6988,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,At least I'm trying to manage this amidst other responsibilities. What's your excuse?,2024-09-03 21:47:54
6989,escalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,"My excuse? My excuse is that I relied on you to do your part,",2024-09-03 21:49:54
6990,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up to band rehearsal yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:02:58
6991,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,"I had other things to do, and I didn't think it was urgent.",2024-09-03 21:10:58
6992,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,"Not urgent? We have a performance next week, and you don't think it's urgent?",2024-09-03 21:15:58
6993,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,Can't you guys practice without me for one session? It's not like I'm the only important member.,2024-09-03 21:19:58
6994,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,That's not the point! We need everyone there if we're going to sound good.,2024-09-03 21:25:58
6995,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,"Well, I can't drop everything for every single rehearsal. I have a life outside of this band, you know.",2024-09-03 21:30:58
6996,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,"We all have lives outside the band, but we still commit to showing up. Why can't you?",2024-09-03 21:39:58
6997,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,Maybe because I don't think we're going anywhere with this band. It's just a hobby for me.,2024-09-03 21:40:58
6998,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,A hobby? That's insulting to everyone who's put in the effort and time.,2024-09-03 21:41:58
6999,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,Insulting? What's insulting is how seriously you take this. Lighten up!,2024-09-03 21:47:58
7000,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,You're the one who needs to take this seriously. You agreed to be part of this band.,2024-09-03 21:53:58
7001,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,"Agreed to be a part of, not to make it my entire life. There's a difference.",2024-09-03 22:02:58
7002,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,"If you don't want to be here, then why don't you just quit?",2024-09-03 22:07:58
7003,escalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,"Maybe I will! If this is how it's going to be, filled with impossible expectations and no",2024-09-03 22:17:58
7004,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,"I cannot believe you submitted the group project without telling any of us, Sarah!",2024-09-03 21:09:02
7005,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,"I did what had to be done, James. You all were dragging your feet, and the deadline was approaching.",2024-09-03 21:18:02
7006,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_3,But we were still working on it. How could you decide that it's finished by yourself?,2024-09-03 21:19:02
7007,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,"Emma, we wouldn't have finished in time if I waited for everyone to agree. Sometimes, decisions have to be made quickly.",2024-09-03 21:29:02
7008,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,That doesn’t give you the right to ignore everyone else's input. This was supposed to be a collaborative effort.,2024-09-03 21:32:02
7009,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,Collaboration doesn't mean endless discussions and indecision. We weren’t getting anywhere.,2024-09-03 21:41:02
7010,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_4,"Sarah, you could have at least sent a message letting us know you were planning to submit it.",2024-09-03 21:42:02
7011,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,And risk hearing more complaints and no action? I did what I thought was best for all of us.,2024-09-03 21:47:02
7012,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_3,Now it's full of errors we could have fixed together! Our grade is going to suffer.,2024-09-03 21:53:02
7013,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,"Exactly, we all have strengths and weaknesses. Working together would have produced a better result.",2024-09-03 22:00:02
7014,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,"So, we miss the deadline and lose points? At least now we have something submitted.",2024-09-03 22:02:02
7015,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_4,It's not just about submission; it’s about the quality of work. Do you even care about that?,2024-09-03 22:05:02
7016,escalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,"Of course, I care! But we were running out of",2024-09-03 22:08:02
7017,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,Why did you think it was okay to go behind my back and change the project plan without discussing it with me first?,2024-09-03 21:08:05
7018,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,"Because your plan wasn't working, and we were running out of time. Someone had to take action.",2024-09-03 21:15:05
7019,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,That's not your decision to make alone! We are supposed to be partners in this!,2024-09-03 21:16:05
7020,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,Partners? You've been controlling every single decision since day one. I couldn't just wait for the project to fail.,2024-09-03 21:21:05
7021,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,Controlling? I'm just trying to keep us on track! You're the one who keeps messing things up with impulsive decisions!,2024-09-03 21:26:05
7022,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,Impulsive? You mean like when you decided we should change the entire design three days before the deadline?,2024-09-03 21:34:05
7023,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,That was because you didn't speak up during the initial planning sessions. Now we're stuck in damage control mode!,2024-09-03 21:35:05
7024,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,I didn't speak up because you shut down every idea that wasn't yours!,2024-09-03 21:38:05
7025,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,"Maybe if your ideas were practical instead of reckless, I would actually listen!",2024-09-03 21:39:05
7026,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,Reckless? At least I have ideas! All you do is shoot them down and create more work with pointless revisions.,2024-09-03 21:40:05
7027,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,"Pointless revisions? These are necessary adjustments to prevent this project from being a total disaster, thanks to your shortcuts!",2024-09-03 21:48:05
7028,escalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,Shortcuts? Do you even know how hard I've been working to keep this going while you nitpick everything?,2024-09-03 21:56:05
7029,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,I can't believe you lost the blueprint again!,2024-09-03 21:04:09
7030,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,Me? You're the one who left it on the table last night!,2024-09-03 21:12:09
7031,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,"No, I specifically put it in the project folder. You must have moved it.",2024-09-03 21:13:09
7032,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,Why would I move it? You're always so careless with these things.,2024-09-03 21:18:09
7033,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,Careless? I’m the one who’s been doing all the work while you keep disappearing!,2024-09-03 21:19:09
7034,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,Disappearing? I’ve been meeting clients to secure contracts while you mess around with details.,2024-09-03 21:28:09
7035,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,"Oh sure, like that last ""contract"" you lost us because you overslept.",2024-09-03 21:32:09
7036,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,That was one time! And you’re just bitter because they liked my presentation better.,2024-09-03 21:37:09
7037,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,"Better? It was full of mistakes! If it wasn't for my corrections, we’d have lost more than just that contract.",2024-09-03 21:43:09
7038,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,"Mistakes? Those were strategic modifications. Unlike your rigid, outdated ideas.",2024-09-03 21:53:09
7039,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,So now my experience is outdated? I've been doing this for ten years!,2024-09-03 22:01:09
7040,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,And maybe it’s time you evolved. The industry isn’t the same as it was a decade ago.,2024-09-03 22:11:09
7041,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,"""Evolve"" doesn't mean losing important documents and missing deadlines!",2024-09-03 22:15:09
7042,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,"Maybe if you learned to communicate and used the shared calendar, we wouldn't have half these problems.",2024-09-03 22:16:09
7043,escalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,I wouldn’t have to,2024-09-03 22:24:09
7044,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,"We were supposed to submit the group project today, and the presentation is a mess!",2024-09-03 21:12:12
7045,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,"Oh, really? Who's the one who didn't even show up to our last two meetings?",2024-09-03 21:17:12
7046,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,I had work! What’s your excuse for not uploading your part until the last minute?,2024-09-03 21:20:12
7047,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_3,"Can you both stop? We need to focus on fixing this, not pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 21:22:12
7048,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,Easy for you to say! You didn’t even bother to review my slides after I sent them over.,2024-09-03 21:24:12
7049,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_3,Because I was too busy editing the mess you both made with the data!,2024-09-03 21:29:12
7050,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,Don’t blame us for the data; you were supposed to verify it from the start.,2024-09-03 21:37:12
7051,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,This isn’t just about the data. None of you communicated properly! I was left in the dark half the time.,2024-09-03 21:38:12
7052,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_3,"Everyone agreed to use the group chat, but somebody didn’t even read the messages.",2024-09-03 21:39:12
7053,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,And I’m tired of carrying the team every time we have a project. This isn't fair!,2024-09-03 21:48:12
7054,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you’re the martyr? You barely contributed!",2024-09-03 21:50:12
7055,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_3,"Can we just divide the tasks clearly for once, instead of having this shouting match?",2024-09-03 22:00:12
7056,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,Only if people start taking responsibility and not disappearing when it gets tough.,2024-09-03 22:09:12
7057,escalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,I’m not disappearing; I've been juggling other responsibilities too!,2024-09-03 22:18:12
7058,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just did that, Michael!",2024-09-03 21:03:16
7059,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"Why do you always have to make such a big deal out of everything, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:12:16
7060,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,A big deal? You just deleted all of our project files!,2024-09-03 21:18:16
7061,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"Maybe if someone had backed them up like they were supposed to, this wouldn't be an issue!",2024-09-03 21:22:16
7062,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_3,"Guys, can we please focus on finding a solution instead of blaming each other?",2024-09-03 21:28:16
7063,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,"How can I not blame him, Emma? This project was due tomorrow!",2024-09-03 21:31:16
7064,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"Oh, don't act like you haven't messed up before, Sarah! Remember last week when you left your notes at home?",2024-09-03 21:39:16
7065,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,"That was different, Michael. We still had time to fix it, unlike now!",2024-09-03 21:42:16
7066,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_3,Arguing isn't helping us meet the deadline. What do we do next?,2024-09-03 21:48:16
7067,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,Next? We start over because of Michael's mistake!,2024-09-03 21:52:16
7068,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"Fine, drag me through the mud. But standing around yelling won't get our files back.",2024-09-03 21:56:16
7069,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_3,Maybe there's a way to recover the files from the cloud?,2024-09-03 22:01:16
7070,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,Would that even work? I thought everything got wiped.,2024-09-03 22:06:16
7071,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"It's worth a shot. Any better ideas, Sarah?",2024-09-03 22:16:16
7072,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,"No, not really. I guess it's the best option we have right now. Can someone check the recovery options?",2024-09-03 22:17:16
7073,escalatory_conversation_479,speaker_3,I'll do it,2024-09-03 22:23:16
7074,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball? We were right there at the goal!,2024-09-03 21:09:20
7075,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,Are you serious? You were surrounded by their defenders!,2024-09-03 21:15:20
7076,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_3,Both of you need to focus! We're down by three points and fighting isn't helping.,2024-09-03 21:18:20
7077,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,"Well, we can't score if someone decides to hog the ball all game.",2024-09-03 21:20:20
7078,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,Hog the ball? I've set up almost every play today!,2024-09-03 21:24:20
7079,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_4,"Stop, everyone! We need to stick to the strategy we practiced.",2024-09-03 21:31:20
7080,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,It's hard to stick to any strategy when certain people think they're the entire team.,2024-09-03 21:33:20
7081,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the problem? Maybe if you actually showed up to practice, you'd understand the plays better.",2024-09-03 21:42:20
7082,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_3,"Enough, both of you! This isn't the time for personal attacks.",2024-09-03 21:49:20
7083,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_4,We're wasting precious time arguing. Let's focus on winning this game.,2024-09-03 21:59:20
7084,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,"Fine, but if we lose, don't blame me for not trying.",2024-09-03 22:01:20
7085,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,That’s the thing. You think you’re the only one trying!,2024-09-03 22:08:20
7086,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_3,This back and forth is helping no one. Let's just play our best.,2024-09-03 22:17:20
7087,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,"Agreed. But we need to act like a team, not a bunch of solo players.",2024-09-03 22:26:20
7088,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,"Fine, I'm in. But next time, communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:35:20
7089,escalatory_conversation_480,speaker_4,"Good, now let's get out there and turn this around",2024-09-03 22:36:20
7090,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,Why haven't you turned in your part of the group project yet?,2024-09-03 21:10:23
7091,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,"I've been busy, okay? Stop nagging me about it.",2024-09-03 21:11:23
7092,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,Busy? We're all busy! You promised you'd get it done last week!,2024-09-03 21:16:23
7093,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't so controlling, I'd actually have time to work on it.",2024-09-03 21:20:23
7094,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,Controlling? I'm trying to keep us from failing!,2024-09-03 21:22:23
7095,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_3,"Guys, we need to focus. This isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:31:23
7096,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,It's hard to focus when someone's not pulling their weight!,2024-09-03 21:38:23
7097,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,Who are you calling dead weight? I've done plenty for this project!,2024-09-03 21:39:23
7098,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,Like what? You've barely contributed anything!,2024-09-03 21:42:23
7099,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,"Oh, and you're the project hero? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:44:23
7100,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_3,"Seriously, we can’t afford to fight over this.",2024-09-03 21:51:23
7101,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,I wouldn't have to fight if someone did what they were supposed to!,2024-09-03 21:52:23
7102,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,Maybe you should look in the mirror. All you've done is criticize.,2024-09-03 22:01:23
7103,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,I'm criticizing because you're not doing your part.,2024-09-03 22:04:23
7104,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,Whatever. I'm done with this. I'll finish it when I have time.,2024-09-03 22:14:23
7105,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_3,This is getting out of hand. We need to work together.,2024-09-03 22:15:23
7106,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,"Working together means everyone contributing, not just making excuses.",2024-09-03 22:25:23
7107,escalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,I'm not making excuses. I'm dealing with a lot right now.,2024-09-03 22:35:23
7108,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"Why is the Smith account still incomplete, Tom? You promised it would be ready by today.",2024-09-03 21:06:27
7109,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"I know, Rachel, but I had a lot of other tasks lined up. You could have pitched in too.",2024-09-03 21:07:27
7110,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,Are you serious? I've been handling three other accounts because you said you had this!,2024-09-03 21:10:27
7111,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"Well, maybe you should manage your time better. I'm not a miracle worker!",2024-09-03 21:17:27
7112,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_3,"Guys, can we focus on getting this done instead of blaming each other?",2024-09-03 21:18:27
7113,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Jenny. You’re not the one who’s going to get grilled by the boss for this mess.",2024-09-03 21:21:27
7114,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"Yeah, she’s always avoiding responsibilities. No wonder she’s never in trouble.",2024-09-03 21:27:27
7115,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_3,That's not true and you know it! I just don’t make a big deal out of everything.,2024-09-03 21:36:27
7116,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"This is not “everything”! This is our biggest client! Jenny, you barely even looked at the project plan!",2024-09-03 21:38:27
7117,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"Exactly, she’s been too busy cozying up to management while we do all the grunt work.",2024-09-03 21:43:27
7118,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_3,"Oh come on, that’s unfair! I’ve been carrying my weight, you two just don’t see it.",2024-09-03 21:47:27
7119,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"Carrying your weight? Really? If you had been, we wouldn’t be in this situation right now!",2024-09-03 21:55:27
7120,escalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"This is just typical of you two,",2024-09-03 22:02:27
7121,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,You never take my ideas seriously during the band practice.,2024-09-03 21:10:30
7122,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,"Oh please, your ideas are always off-track and irrelevant.",2024-09-03 21:12:30
7123,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,Irrelevant? I’m trying to bring something new to our sound!,2024-09-03 21:19:30
7124,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,"Yeah, and it’s killing the vibe we already have!",2024-09-03 21:29:30
7125,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,How can you say that? We haven't even tried them out properly.,2024-09-03 21:33:30
7126,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,"We don’t need to try them out, I know they won’t work.",2024-09-03 21:38:30
7127,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,That’s just being stubborn and close-minded.,2024-09-03 21:45:30
7128,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,And you’re being unrealistic and annoying!,2024-09-03 21:53:30
7129,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,I just want us to improve and maybe get more gigs.,2024-09-03 21:54:30
7130,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,Improvement doesn't mean throwing away everything that’s working.,2024-09-03 22:04:30
7131,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,I’m not suggesting that. I’m suggesting we evolve.,2024-09-03 22:07:30

7135,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,I can’t if you keep shutting me down every single time.,2024-09-03 22:30:30
7136,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,Maybe because your ideas are always impractical and out of place.,2024-09-03 22:35:30
7137,escalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,And maybe you just fear change too much to give them a chance.,2024-09-03 22:37:30
7138,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,Why did you tell the coach that I wasn't pulling my weight on the team?,2024-09-03 21:09:33
7139,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"Because you weren't, and someone needed to say it.",2024-09-03 21:16:33
7140,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,That's not true. I work just as hard as everyone else!,2024-09-03 21:20:33
7141,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,Really? Then why did you skip practice last week?,2024-09-03 21:24:33
7142,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,"I had a family emergency, and you know that!",2024-09-03 21:31:33
7143,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"Excuses, excuses. Everyone's got problems, but we still show up.",2024-09-03 21:33:33
7144,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,You’re being unfair. I’ve never missed a practice before!,2024-09-03 21:39:33
7145,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,One missed practice and now you're making a big deal out of it?,2024-09-03 21:42:33
7146,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,"The coach is now treating me like I can’t be relied on anymore, thanks to you!",2024-09-03 21:48:33
7147,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,Maybe you should prove him wrong by showing up and putting in the effort.,2024-09-03 21:58:33
7148,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,I’ve always put in the effort. You’re just trying to make me look bad to take my spot!,2024-09-03 21:59:33
7149,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"Oh, please. Like I need to sabotage you to get ahead.",2024-09-03 22:08:33
7150,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,It's really low of you to throw teammates under the bus like that.,2024-09-03 22:18:33
7151,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"Well, it's better than dragging the whole team down with your personal issues.",2024-09-03 22:22:33
7152,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,I can’t believe you would say that. I thought we were friends!,2024-09-03 22:23:33
7153,escalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"Friends or not, the team comes first. Maybe you should remember that.",2024-09-03 22:33:33
7154,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"Why is the report still not finished, Emily? We were supposed to send it yesterday!",2024-09-03 21:05:37
7155,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you hadn't dumped all the work on me, it would have been done!",2024-09-03 21:08:37
7156,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"Are you serious? I did my part, Emily. What were you doing all weekend?",2024-09-03 21:17:37
7157,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,"Doing my part? So, staying out late with friends and avoiding responsibility is your part now?",2024-09-03 21:27:37
7158,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"Don't turn this around on me. I was available if you needed help, you just never asked!",2024-09-03 21:35:37
7159,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,"I shouldn't have to ask! We agreed on a division of tasks, and you didn't uphold your end.",2024-09-03 21:44:37
7160,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"Oh, that's rich coming from you. The last two projects were practically mine!",2024-09-03 21:48:37
7161,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,You're always trying to take credit for everything. This mess is on you!,2024-09-03 21:58:37
7162,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it. Maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't be in this spot.",2024-09-03 22:00:37
7163,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,So now my communication skills are the problem? Unbelievable!,2024-09-03 22:06:37
7164,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"If the shoe fits, Emily. Maybe consider the possibility that you're not perfect.",2024-09-03 22:12:37
7165,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,Perfect? Who said anything about being perfect? Just competent would be a good start!,2024-09-03 22:14:37
7166,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"Fine, you think I'm incompetent? Let's see how you handle the next project on your own.",2024-09-03 22:19:37
7167,escalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,"Don't worry, I will handle it alone. At least",2024-09-03 22:21:37
7168,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for band practice again, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:07:40
7169,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"I'm tired of repeating myself, Jake. I had other things to do.",2024-09-03 21:15:40
7170,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,Other things? We have a performance next week. What could be more important?,2024-09-03 21:25:40
7171,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't being such a control freak, I'd actually want to practice.",2024-09-03 21:29:40
7172,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,Control freak? I'm just trying to make sure we're actually good enough to perform!,2024-09-03 21:33:40
7173,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"Well, guess what? I don't think I can take your constant nagging anymore.",2024-09-03 21:37:40
7174,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"Fine, then maybe you shouldn't be in the band at all!",2024-09-03 21:42:40
7175,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,Maybe I don't want to be in it with you calling all the shots!,2024-09-03 21:43:40
7176,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"Someone has to, or it all falls apart. Clearly, you're not contributing.",2024-09-03 21:45:40
7177,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"Maybe if you gave people a chance to contribute, we wouldn't be having this argument.",2024-09-03 21:50:40
7178,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,I've given everyone plenty of chances. You're the one who keeps bailing!,2024-09-03 21:52:40
7179,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,Because it's not worth my time when I can't even have a say in anything!,2024-09-03 22:02:40
7180,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"You know what, Alex? If you're going to have that attitude, then just leave.",2024-09-03 22:10:40
7181,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,Fine! I will. Good luck finding someone to replace me on such short notice.,2024-09-03 22:14:40
7182,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,At least whoever I find will actually show up.,2024-09-03 22:21:40
7183,escalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,Don’t hold your breath. You,2024-09-03 22:30:40
7184,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,"You didn't even try to get the proposal done on time, did you?",2024-09-03 21:06:44
7185,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,Are you seriously blaming me for this? You didn’t provide any useful information!,2024-09-03 21:15:44
7186,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it’s my fault? At least I was trying to coordinate everything.",2024-09-03 21:19:44
7187,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,Coordinate? More like micromanage everyone and get nothing done.,2024-09-03 21:22:44
7188,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_3,"Both of you, enough! Throwing blame isn't helping. Let's figure out what went wrong.",2024-09-03 21:31:44
7189,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,We went wrong because someone couldn’t handle their responsibilities.,2024-09-03 21:37:44
7190,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,Don't act like you've been perfect in any of this. You missed two meetings last week!,2024-09-03 21:38:44
7191,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,Because I was dealing with the client’s last-minute changes. What’s your excuse?,2024-09-03 21:47:44
7192,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,My excuse? Maybe the dozens of emails I sent that you ignored.,2024-09-03 21:51:44
7193,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,Ignored? I didn’t ignore anything. Your emails weren't clear at all!,2024-09-03 21:52:44
7194,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_3,Let’s stop with the accusations. Can we identify the actual issue here?,2024-09-03 22:02:44
7195,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,The actual issue is that we aren’t working as a team. Everyone just does whatever they want.,2024-09-03 22:10:44
7196,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,That’s rich coming from you. You’ve been nothing but difficult to work with.,2024-09-03 22:19:44
7197,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_3,"Enough! We need solutions, not insults. How can we fix this now?",2024-09-03 22:26:44
7198,escalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,"Maybe if we had some real leadership around here, things wouldn’t fall apart",2024-09-03 22:34:44
7199,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and changed our group's project without asking anyone!,2024-09-03 21:05:47
7200,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to make a decision, and nobody was responding in the group chat.",2024-09-03 21:12:47
7201,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,"That's not an excuse! We all agreed on the original plan, and you just ignored that.",2024-09-03 21:16:47
7202,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_3,"Hold on, what changes are you talking about? I didn't even know anything had changed.",2024-09-03 21:24:47
7203,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,"I added more data analysis sections because our presentation was too basic. We need to stand out, okay?",2024-09-03 21:31:47
7204,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,Those sections are going to take hours to complete! We're already stretched thin as it is.,2024-09-03 21:32:47
7205,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_3,This is the first I'm hearing about more data analysis. When were you going to inform us?,2024-09-03 21:40:47
7206,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,I posted the update in the chat yesterday. It's not my fault if you didn't read it.,2024-09-03 21:50:47
7207,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,A single message buried in a sea of notifications? Great communication strategy.,2024-09-03 21:53:47
7208,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_3,"Seriously, you could've at least waited until we had a call to discuss it.",2024-09-03 21:58:47
7209,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,Waiting for what? Another week of indecision? We don't have that kind of time.,2024-09-03 22:02:47
7210,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,"This is typical of you, always bulldozing over everyone else's input.",2024-09-03 22:10:47
7211,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,"And what's typical of you, always dragging your feet and never making any real contributions.",2024-09-03 22:20:47
7212,escalatory_conversation_488,speaker_3,Can we stop this bickering and focus on what we're going to do next,2024-09-03 22:30:47
7213,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and talked to the board without telling me!,2024-09-03 21:05:52
7214,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,"I did what needed to be done for the project. You were dragging your feet, and we were running out of time!",2024-09-03 21:12:52
7215,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,Dragging my feet? I've been working around the clock while you were off schmoozing with the higher-ups!,2024-09-03 21:16:52
7216,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,"If it wasn't for me ""schmoozing,"" we wouldn't even have the funding to continue this project. Maybe you should show some gratitude.",2024-09-03 21:22:52
7217,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,Gratitude? For what? Undermining me and making me look incompetent?,2024-09-03 21:23:52
7218,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,You made yourself look incompetent by being so disorganized and slow. The board needed to see some progress.,2024-09-03 21:32:52
7219,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"Disorganized? At least I actually know what I'm talking about! Meanwhile, you're just spouting buzzwords.",2024-09-03 21:36:52
7220,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,Buzzwords that got us the money! Your so-called expertise wasn’t getting us anywhere.,2024-09-03 21:44:52
7221,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"You’re unbelievable. Do you even care about this project, or is this all just a power trip for you?",2024-09-03 21:52:52
7222,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,"Oh please, you’re the one always wanting to control every tiny detail like some dictator. Maybe if you let go a little, we'd actually get things done!",2024-09-03 22:01:52
7223,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"Control every detail? It’s called being thorough, something you should try sometime instead of cutting corners.",2024-09-03 22:02:52
7224,escalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,Cutting corners? I’m,2024-09-03 22:07:52
7225,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,"You know what, Mark? I've had it with you constantly dropping the ball in our group projects.",2024-09-03 21:04:55
7226,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,"Excuse me? I didn't see you doing much either, Jane. Maybe if you actually contributed something useful, we'd get somewhere.",2024-09-03 21:05:55
7227,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,"I do my part, unlike you! You just coast along, expecting others to do the heavy lifting.",2024-09-03 21:12:55
7228,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,That's rich coming from the person who missed the last two meetings. Do you even care about this project?,2024-09-03 21:14:55
7229,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,Of course I care! But how am I supposed to work with someone who doesn't even respect deadlines?,2024-09-03 21:20:55
7230,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,Respect deadlines? You're the one who sent in your part of the report five minutes before it was due!,2024-09-03 21:30:55
7231,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,At least I sent something. Remember last week's presentation? You didn't even show up prepared!,2024-09-03 21:37:55
7232,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,"Oh, like you were flawless? Your slides were a mess, and you rambled without making any sense.",2024-09-03 21:43:55
7233,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,"Maybe if you had helped with the slides, they wouldn't have been a mess!",2024-09-03 21:48:55
7234,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,"And maybe if you'd stopped being so controlling, I could have contributed something meaningful.",2024-09-03 21:56:55
7235,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,Controlling? I'm the only one keeping this project from falling apart!,2024-09-03 22:04:55
7236,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,"Keep telling yourself that, Jane. You're just making excuses for your lack of teamwork.",2024-09-03 22:11:55
7237,escalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,Lack of teamwork? You wouldn't even know what teamwork looks like if it hit you,2024-09-03 22:19:55
7238,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you messed up the project proposal, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:03:59
7239,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,"Messed up? Are you serious, John? I was under so much pressure trying to juggle everything because you never do your part.",2024-09-03 21:08:59
7240,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,"Oh, really? Last time I checked, you were the project manager. Managing the proposal was your job.",2024-09-03 21:11:59
7241,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,"Managing, yes, but not doing everything! I asked you to finalize the budget, and you completely ignored me.",2024-09-03 21:14:59
7242,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,"I didn't ignore you, I had my own responsibilities to take care of. Maybe if you communicated better, things wouldn't fall apart.",2024-09-03 21:21:59
7243,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,Communicated better? I sent you multiple emails and reminders. It's not my fault if you can't keep track of your own tasks.,2024-09-03 21:23:59
7244,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,Multiple emails don't count when the deadlines weren't clear from the start. You should have set things straight from the beginning.,2024-09-03 21:31:59
7245,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,"Deadlines weren't clear? They were in the project timeline I shared on our first meeting! Maybe if you paid attention, this wouldn't be an issue now.",2024-09-03 21:40:59
7246,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,I did pay attention. It's just that your timeline was overly ambitious and unrealistic from the start.,2024-09-03 21:42:59
7247,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,Unrealistic because you didn't stick to it! Why do you always push the blame onto others when things go wrong?,2024-09-03 21:43:59
7248,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,Maybe because I'm tired of picking up the slack for your lack of organization.,2024-09-03 21:51:59
7249,escalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,Lack,2024-09-03 21:52:59
7250,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,I can't believe you dropped the ball during the final pass!,2024-09-03 21:09:03
7251,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,Are you serious? I was wide open and you made a terrible throw!,2024-09-03 21:10:03
7252,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,"A terrible throw? If you had just run the route like I told you, it would have been perfect!",2024-09-03 21:14:03
7253,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren’t always hogging the ball, you’d know how to make a decent pass!",2024-09-03 21:16:03
7254,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_3,Can you both stop blaming each other? We lost because we didn't play as a team.,2024-09-03 21:17:03
7255,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault we lost? Maybe if you had covered your man better, they wouldn't have scored half those points!",2024-09-03 21:26:03
7256,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_4,How about you all focus on the fact that we barely practiced this week because someone kept skipping practices?,2024-09-03 21:31:03
7257,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,"You're really bringing that up now? I have a life outside this team, you know!",2024-09-03 21:38:03
7258,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,Then maybe you shouldn't be on the team if you can't commit!,2024-09-03 21:44:03
7259,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_3,Enough! We're going in circles. This blame game is not helping us improve.,2024-09-03 21:54:03
7260,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_4,"Seriously, we need to think about how to fix our issues instead of tearing each other apart.",2024-09-03 21:56:03
7261,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,"Fine, but it still feels like no one is taking responsibility for their mistakes.",2024-09-03 22:03:03
7262,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,"Oh, I'm taking responsibility, but you need to acknowledge your part too!",2024-09-03 22:10:03
7263,escalatory_conversation_492,speaker_3,How about this—we all list one thing we could have,2024-09-03 22:13:03
7264,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,Why didn't anybody tell me we changed the plan for the science project?,2024-09-03 21:08:06
7265,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,We didn't need to. You never show up to the meetings anyway.,2024-09-03 21:17:06
7266,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,"Hey, that's not fair. I told you I'd be busy with my soccer practice.",2024-09-03 21:24:06
7267,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,"But soccer practice isn't every single day, is it?",2024-09-03 21:27:06
7268,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,It feels like it is! You're always using it as an excuse to bail.,2024-09-03 21:28:06
7269,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,That's ridiculous. Stop making it sound like I'm lazy.,2024-09-03 21:37:06
7270,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,Just face it. We end up doing all the work and then you swoop in last minute.,2024-09-03 21:46:06
7271,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,"Yeah, and you expect to get the same credit as us. It's really frustrating!",2024-09-03 21:50:06
7272,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,You think I don't contribute anything? I've done all the research!,2024-09-03 21:56:06
7273,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,Doing research at the last minute doesn't help us organize everything.,2024-09-03 22:03:06
7274,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,Exactly! We have to do all the detailed work while you just dump information.,2024-09-03 22:07:06
7275,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,At least I'm contributing! More than I can say for some of you.,2024-09-03 22:12:06
7276,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,"Oh, so now you're blaming us? Nice!",2024-09-03 22:20:06
7277,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe it's better if you just don't work with us anymore.,2024-09-03 22:21:06
7278,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,Fine! Maybe I will work alone. I'm tired of being unappreciated!,2024-09-03 22:31:06
7279,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,Good luck doing everything by yourself then. You'll need it.,2024-09-03 22:40:06
7280,escalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,Yeah,2024-09-03 22:42:06
7281,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,I can't believe you told the professor about my project idea without asking me!,2024-09-03 21:08:10
7282,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"Are you kidding me? You weren't doing anything with it, and I needed a good idea for my presentation.",2024-09-03 21:11:10
7283,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,That doesn't give you the right to just take my work and pass it off as your own!,2024-09-03 21:16:10
7284,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"Oh, like you haven't done the same thing to me before? Remember that lab report last semester?",2024-09-03 21:24:10
7285,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,"That was different! I asked you before and we worked on it together. This time, you didn't even bother to include me.",2024-09-03 21:29:10
7286,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"Maybe because whenever we work together, you try to take all the credit and make it seem like everything is your idea!",2024-09-03 21:37:10
7287,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,"You're twisting things now. This was my idea, my research, and you just swooped in and took it!",2024-09-03 21:46:10
7288,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you were more proactive, I wouldn't have had to do that. You always procrastinate and expect everyone else to clean up your mess.",2024-09-03 21:50:10
7289,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who barely did their share on the last group project. I had to cover for you then too!,2024-09-03 21:52:10
7290,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"Oh please, I had a lot going on, and you knew that. Not that you care about anyone else's problems besides your own.",2024-09-03 21:53:10
7291,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,"I do care, but you never communicate. You just act selfishly and think it's fine.",2024-09-03 21:55:10
7292,escalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,Maybe,2024-09-03 22:02:10
7293,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,Why did you take my design ideas and present them as your own?,2024-09-03 21:04:14
7294,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"Oh come on, you never finalized them. Someone had to take action.",2024-09-03 21:05:14
7295,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,That doesn't justify stealing my work. You didn't even give me credit.,2024-09-03 21:12:14
7296,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"We needed to win the client over, and your ideas were just sitting there. I made them better.",2024-09-03 21:14:14
7297,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,Better? You didn't change anything! You just slapped your name on them!,2024-09-03 21:22:14
7298,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you acted faster, this wouldn't have happened.",2024-09-03 21:27:14
7299,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,Don't put this on me. You had no right to do that.,2024-09-03 21:31:14
7300,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,And you had no right to waste time. We’re a team; this was for all of us.,2024-09-03 21:35:14
7301,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,A team doesn't mean you can trample over my contributions.,2024-09-03 21:39:14
7302,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_3,What's going on here?,2024-09-03 21:40:14
7303,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,He stole my design ideas and presented them as his own.,2024-09-03 21:42:14
7304,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,I improved them and got us the client’s approval.,2024-09-03 21:52:14
7305,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_3,That’s still not ethical. We need to respect each other's work.,2024-09-03 22:02:14
7306,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,Respect goes both ways. Just sitting on ideas isn't helpful to anyone.,2024-09-03 22:11:14
7307,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,I was refining them. Taking someone's work without permission is plain theft.,2024-09-03 22:13:14
7308,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_3,We need to find a way to give credit where it’s due.,2024-09-03 22:16:14
7309,escalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"Fine, going forward, but what’s done",2024-09-03 22:17:14
7310,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up for the group project meeting again!,2024-09-03 21:10:17
7311,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_2,Are you serious? I told you I had a family emergency.,2024-09-03 21:17:17
7312,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_1,"You always have an excuse. We're all busting our butts, and you're just flaking out!",2024-09-03 21:24:17
7313,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_2,Flaking out? I’ve done more research than anyone else in the group!,2024-09-03 21:33:17
7314,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_1,Research means nothing if you're not here to discuss and contribute.,2024-09-03 21:38:17
7315,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_3,"Hey, let's just try to calm down and figure out how to move forward.",2024-09-03 21:46:17
7316,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_1,"No, this is the third time he's ghosted us. We can't keep covering for him.",2024-09-03 21:49:17
7317,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_2,And I can't believe you're questioning my commitment when I've been up all night working on this.,2024-09-03 21:51:17
7318,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_3,We have a deadline to meet. This fighting isn't helping us get there.,2024-09-03 22:00:17
7319,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_1,"Fine, but if he skips another meeting, I'm going to the professor.",2024-09-03 22:07:17
7320,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_2,Go ahead and do that. I'll explain my side and we'll see who gets the last laugh.,2024-09-03 22:09:17
7321,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_3,"Seriously, you two, we need to work together or we’re all going to fail this project.",2024-09-03 22:13:17
7322,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_1,Then he needs to start actually showing up and being part of the team.,2024-09-03 22:22:17
7323,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_2,And you need to stop acting like you're the boss of everyone.,2024-09-03 22:29:17
7324,escalatory_conversation_496,speaker_3,Enough! We're running out of time. Are we going to get this,2024-09-03 22:37:17
7325,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and told the coach I wasn't practicing enough!,2024-09-03 21:12:21
7326,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_2,You weren't! And the team is suffering because of it. Someone had to say something.,2024-09-03 21:15:21
7327,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_1,"Oh, so you're the hero now? Saving the team by ratting me out?",2024-09-03 21:18:21
7328,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_2,"It's not about being a hero. It's about everyone giving their best, and you weren't.",2024-09-03 21:25:21
7329,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_1,You don't even know what I'm dealing with outside of practice. You think it's that simple?,2024-09-03 21:29:21
7330,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_2,"We all have stuff going on, but we still show up and give it our all. Why can't you?",2024-09-03 21:32:21
7331,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_1,Maybe because I'm not as perfect as you. Ever think about that?,2024-09-03 21:40:21
7332,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_2,This isn't about being perfect; it's about commitment. You said you'd be dedicated this season.,2024-09-03 21:50:21
7333,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_1,"Yeah, but I didn't sign up to get stabbed in the back by my own teammate.",2024-09-03 22:00:21
7334,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_2,I'd rather deal with your anger than let the whole team down because you're slacking off.,2024-09-03 22:08:21
7335,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_1,This is ridiculous. I can't even trust my own team anymore.,2024-09-03 22:11:21
7336,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_2,Trust isn't built by neglecting your responsibilities. How can the team rely on you like this?,2024-09-03 22:14:21
7337,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_1,"You don't get it, do you? It's not that black and white.",2024-09-03 22:23:21
7338,escalatory_conversation_497,speaker_2,"You're right, I don't get it. I don't get why you can't communicate with us instead of",2024-09-03 22:25:21
7339,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,Why haven't you done your part of the group project yet?,2024-09-03 21:10:24
7340,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,I've been busy with other classes. Why don't you cut me some slack?,2024-09-03 21:15:24
7341,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,Everyone else has managed their time. Why can't you?,2024-09-03 21:17:24
7342,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,Maybe because you're not the only one with a busy schedule!,2024-09-03 21:26:24
7343,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously? We need to get this done.",2024-09-03 21:28:24
7344,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,"Oh, like you've been perfect! You've barely contributed!",2024-09-03 21:35:24
7345,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_3,At least I've done something. What have you done?,2024-09-03 21:36:24
7346,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,Enough with the excuses. We’re going to fail if you don’t step up.,2024-09-03 21:45:24
7347,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe I don’t care if we fail.,2024-09-03 21:48:24
7348,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,That’s selfish and unfair to the rest of us!,2024-09-03 21:54:24
7349,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_3,"Seriously, we all need this grade. Why are you being like this?",2024-09-03 21:59:24
7350,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,Maybe because I'm tired of always being blamed for everything!,2024-09-03 22:06:24
7351,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,"Maybe if you actually did your share, you wouldn't get blamed!",2024-09-03 22:10:24
7352,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_3,"This isn't helping. We need to find a solution, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 22:17:24
7353,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,"A solution? How about I just drop the project, that would solve everything.",2024-09-03 22:25:24
7354,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,"That’s the easy way out. We’re a team, for better or worse.",2024-09-03 22:29:24
7355,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_3,Can we all just calm down and figure out what needs to be done?,2024-09-03 22:39:24
7356,escalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:43:24
7357,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,"You never show up for band practice on time, and it's driving me nuts, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:13:27
7358,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. I have other things going on, you know?",2024-09-03 21:21:27
7359,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,"Yeah, but this is important. We have a gig coming up, and we sound terrible because we can't practice properly.",2024-09-03 21:30:27
7360,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on making the most of the time when we're all here?",2024-09-03 21:33:27
7361,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Mike, you're never the one waiting around.",2024-09-03 21:35:27
7362,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,"Sarah, you're acting like you're the only one who cares about this band.",2024-09-03 21:39:27
7363,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,"Because I seem to be the only one prioritizing it! I'm here on time, ready to practice, while you stroll in whenever you feel like it.",2024-09-03 21:40:27
7364,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't such a control freak, I'd be more motivated to be here on time!",2024-09-03 21:49:27
7365,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_3,Can we not do this right now? We have less than an hour to practice.,2024-09-03 21:59:27
7366,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,"Fine, but this isn’t over, Jake. We need to sort this out if we're going to make this work.",2024-09-03 22:05:27
7367,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,"Whatever, let's just get started so you can stop complaining.",2024-09-03 22:08:27
7368,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_4,"Hey, can we play something already? This arguing is getting us nowhere.",2024-09-03 22:13:27
7369,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,"Alright, let's just start from the top and run through the setlist.",2024-09-03 22:19:27
7370,escalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:23:27
7371,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you changed the project deadline, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:12:31
7372,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,"I didn't think I had to run every single decision past you, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:22:31
7373,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,It's a team project. We should be making decisions together!,2024-09-03 21:27:31
7374,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,"Well, it felt like I was the only one actually doing any work, so I decided to take charge.",2024-09-03 21:30:31
7375,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_3,"Hold on, both of you. Can we just discuss this without yelling?",2024-09-03 21:39:31
7376,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,"Oh, now you want to discuss? Where were you when Alex unilaterally changed everything?",2024-09-03 21:42:31
7377,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more reliable, I wouldn't have had to change the deadline!",2024-09-03 21:46:31
7378,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,Reliable? I've been doing my part!,2024-09-03 21:54:31
7379,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn't helping. Can we just focus on fixing it instead?",2024-09-03 22:00:31
7380,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,Fixing it? Sarah is the one causing all the issues here!,2024-09-03 22:02:31
7381,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,What issues? You're the one not communicating!,2024-09-03 22:04:31
7382,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,"Oh please, every time I say something, you shoot it down.",2024-09-03 22:11:31
7383,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_3,Enough! We need to figure out what still needs to be done for this project.,2024-09-03 22:13:31
7384,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,"Fine, but we need to agree that we communicate decisions from now on.",2024-09-03 22:14:31
7385,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,"Agreed, but it goes both ways. You need to start contributing more.",2024-09-03 22:16:31
7386,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,I'll contribute once you start informing everyone about changes.,2024-09-03 22:22:31
7387,escalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,Deal,2024-09-03 22:23:31
7388,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead without me.,2024-09-03 21:05:34
7389,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,"You were taking forever, so I had to!",2024-09-03 21:10:34
7390,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_3,"Wait, what's going on here?",2024-09-03 21:18:34
7391,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,"We were supposed to work on the project together, but they started without me.",2024-09-03 21:22:34
7392,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,Because you were late! We had a deadline!,2024-09-03 21:24:34
7393,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_3,Maybe we should have waited a bit longer. It's supposed to be a group effort.,2024-09-03 21:31:34
7394,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,Exactly. Now our work is disjointed and inconsistent.,2024-09-03 21:36:34
7395,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you actually showed up on time, we wouldn't have this problem!",2024-09-03 21:45:34
7396,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_3,Can we focus on fixing this instead of just yelling at each other?,2024-09-03 21:52:34
7397,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,It's hard to fix something when part of the group doesn't respect the others' time.,2024-09-03 21:54:34
7398,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,Respect time? You're the one who's late to everything!,2024-09-03 21:58:34
7399,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_3,"Okay, enough. Let's figure out how to integrate the work we have so far.",2024-09-03 22:01:34
7400,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,"Fine, but I'm not letting this slide. You can't just ignore part of the team.",2024-09-03 22:08:34
7401,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,I didn't ignore you; I adapted to the situation. There's a difference.,2024-09-03 22:09:34
7402,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_3,"Seriously, we need to focus. Our grade is on the line here.",2024-09-03 22:17:34
7403,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,Whatever. Let's just get this done.,2024-09-03 22:24:34
7404,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,"Yeah, let's.",2024-09-03 22:31:34
7405,escalatory_conversation_501,speaker_3,"Finally, some agreement. Let's start with the main section",2024-09-03 22:32:34
7406,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,"Why is the design proposal not finished yet, Tom?",2024-09-03 21:10:37
7407,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,I was waiting for Emily's input on the layout changes.,2024-09-03 21:16:37
7408,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_3,"Don't put this on me, Tom. I sent you my feedback last week.",2024-09-03 21:18:37
7409,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,"This project is already behind schedule, and we can't afford any more delays.",2024-09-03 21:28:37
7410,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"Well, excuse me for being thorough. It's better than rushing through and making mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:33:37
7411,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_3,"Oh please, like you haven't made mistakes before. Remember the last two projects?",2024-09-03 21:41:37
7412,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,Enough! We need to come together and get this done. Finger-pointing isn't solving anything.,2024-09-03 21:44:37
7413,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one handling the bulk of the work.",2024-09-03 21:45:37
7414,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_3,"Really, Tom? I reorganized the entire content structure while you were stuck in review mode.",2024-09-03 21:52:37
7415,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,Both of you contributed to this project. Let's focus on solutions.,2024-09-03 21:58:37
7416,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"Fine, then Emily should review the final draft instead since she's so confident.",2024-09-03 22:03:37
7417,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_3,"I will, but you need to start valuing other people's time and effort too.",2024-09-03 22:10:37
7418,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,Can we agree on a new deadline and actually stick to it this time?,2024-09-03 22:20:37
7419,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"As long as Emily doesn't drag her feet, then yes.",2024-09-03 22:24:37
7420,escalatory_conversation_502,speaker_3,"I'm not the one dragging my feet around here, Tom, but whatever. Let's set Friday as the new deadline.",2024-09-03 22:34:37
7421,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,Why did you go behind my back and submit your own proposal to the group?,2024-09-03 21:12:40
7422,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,Because your ideas were outdated and wouldn't get us anywhere!,2024-09-03 21:18:40
7423,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,That's not your call to make. We agreed to discuss everything as a team.,2024-09-03 21:27:40
7424,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,Discuss? All you do is push your own agenda without considering anyone else's input.,2024-09-03 21:30:40
7425,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,"That's not true, and you know it. I always ask for feedback.",2024-09-03 21:38:40
7426,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,"Feedback you can easily ignore, right? This project isn't just yours to dominate.",2024-09-03 21:48:40
7427,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_3,"Enough, both of you! This fighting isn't solving anything.",2024-09-03 21:57:40
7428,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if someone hadn't gone rogue, we wouldn't be here.",2024-09-03 22:06:40
7429,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,Rogue? I was trying to save the project from your wrecking ball of an idea.,2024-09-03 22:08:40
7430,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_3,This needs to stop. We need to find a way to fix this mess.,2024-09-03 22:11:40
7431,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,"Fine, but I'm not accepting that proposal. It's flawed and unrealistic.",2024-09-03 22:16:40
7432,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,"And your plan is any better? It's time we face reality, not live in your fantasy world.",2024-09-03 22:21:40
7433,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_3,Let's put both proposals on the table and analyze them objectively.,2024-09-03 22:26:40
7434,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,I'm willing if they are.,2024-09-03 22:35:40
7435,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,I'm not afraid of the challenge. Bring it on.,2024-09-03 22:41:40
7436,escalatory_conversation_503,speaker_3,Good. Now let's sit down and do this properly before it's too late.,2024-09-03 22:42:40
7437,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,Why did you delete my code from the project without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:07:44
7438,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,It was full of bugs and wasting everyone's time! I had to fix it.,2024-09-03 21:12:44
7439,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,Full of bugs? That's an exaggeration! It was working fine on my machine.,2024-09-03 21:16:44
7440,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,"Well, on the team’s machine, it wasn't! You should've tested it better.",2024-09-03 21:18:44
7441,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,Testing it? I did! Maybe you just didn’t understand how it worked.,2024-09-03 21:21:44
7442,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it’s my fault for not understanding your ""genius"" code?",2024-09-03 21:24:44
7443,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,"I’m not saying that, but a heads-up would’ve been nice before you just erased it!",2024-09-03 21:28:44
7444,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,I don’t have time to babysit your mistakes! We have a deadline.,2024-09-03 21:34:44
7445,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,Mistakes? You act like you’ve never made any in your perfect career.,2024-09-03 21:42:44
7446,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,At least I own up to mine and don’t let the whole team down.,2024-09-03 21:51:44
7447,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,Let the team down? By adding innovative features? You’re so ungrateful.,2024-09-03 21:53:44
7448,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,Innovative? More like unnecessary distractions that broke what was already working.,2024-09-03 22:02:44
7449,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,"If you’re so against change, maybe you should step aside and let someone with vision take over.",2024-09-03 22:04:44
7450,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,Vision? Your vision is just causing chaos. We need stability to meet our deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:13:44
7451,escalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,"Maybe if you weren't so controlling,",2024-09-03 22:23:44
7452,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"You know, I really don't understand why you never pull your weight on group projects, Taylor.",2024-09-03 21:13:47
7453,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,Excuse me? I've done plenty! Just because I don't do things exactly when you want doesn't mean I'm not contributing.,2024-09-03 21:21:47
7454,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,Really? Because it seems like I always end up doing most of the work while you just coast along.,2024-09-03 21:31:47
7455,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,"That's completely unfair! Last time, I stayed up all night fixing your mess of a presentation!",2024-09-03 21:40:47
7456,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_3,"Can both of you stop blaming each other? We have a deadline to meet, and arguing isn’t helping.",2024-09-03 21:47:47
7457,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"Maybe if Taylor actually did something on time, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:57:47
7458,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,"And maybe if you weren't such a control freak, we'd actually work well together.",2024-09-03 22:05:47
7459,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_3,"Seriously, can we just focus on the project? At this rate, we're all going to fail.",2024-09-03 22:14:47
7460,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,Whatever. I’m just tired of feeling like I’m doing all the heavy lifting here.,2024-09-03 22:15:47
7461,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,"And I’m tired of you acting like you’re the only one who does anything. It’s a group project, not the Taylor show.",2024-09-03 22:19:47
7462,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_3,"Fine, how about this: we divide the remaining tasks equally right now and stick to it. Is everyone okay with that?",2024-09-03 22:22:47
7463,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"Fine by me. But Taylor, you'd better actually do your part.",2024-09-03 22:26:47
7464,escalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,"Oh, I will. And",2024-09-03 22:27:47
7465,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,"Why do you always have to hog the spotlight in every group project, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:12:51
7466,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"Excuse me, Jason? I only took the lead because no one else was stepping up.",2024-09-03 21:16:51
7467,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,"That's not true! We all had ideas, but you just ignored them.",2024-09-03 21:21:51
7468,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_3,"Yeah, Sarah, you didn’t even give us a chance to say anything.",2024-09-03 21:27:51
7469,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! If it wasn't for me, we'd still be stuck in the planning phase. You guys were just wasting time.",2024-09-03 21:37:51
7470,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,"Wasting time? We were brainstorming, which you clearly don’t value!",2024-09-03 21:40:51
7471,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_3,It's like you don't even trust us to contribute. Do you think we're useless?,2024-09-03 21:47:51
7472,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"I'm not saying that, but let’s face it, I’m the only one who knows what needs to get done here.",2024-09-03 21:56:51
7473,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_3,"That's so arrogant, Sarah. No wonder nobody wants to work with you.",2024-09-03 22:06:51
7474,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,Arrogant? At least I care enough to do a good job! You two are just coasting along.,2024-09-03 22:16:51
7475,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,We care too! We just don't think one person should be making all the decisions.,2024-09-03 22:19:51
7476,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"Fine, what do you want to do then? Have a never-ending debate where nothing gets done?",2024-09-03 22:28:51
7477,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,"We want equal input. This is a group project, remember?",2024-09-03 22:35:51
7478,escalatory_conversation_506,speaker_3,"Yeah, and if you can't handle",2024-09-03 22:42:51
7479,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,"Why is my research missing from the final report, Greg?",2024-09-03 21:05:55
7480,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,"We decided it wasn't relevant to the overall findings, Karen.",2024-09-03 21:10:55
7481,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,That's not for you to decide alone! It's a collaborative project!,2024-09-03 21:16:55
7482,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,Collaborative? You barely attended half the meetings!,2024-09-03 21:23:55
7483,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,"Because I was busy collecting data, unlike some people!",2024-09-03 21:29:55
7484,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,Don't act like you're the only one contributing here!,2024-09-03 21:32:55
7485,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,"My data is crucial, and you know it!",2024-09-03 21:33:55
7486,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,Then maybe you should have presented it better!,2024-09-03 21:37:55
7487,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,I followed all the guidelines! You're just threatened by my work!,2024-09-03 21:38:55
7488,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,Threatened? Give me a break. We're supposed to be on the same team!,2024-09-03 21:48:55
7489,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,It doesn't feel like a team when you're acting like the boss!,2024-09-03 21:51:55
7490,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,"Someone has to make the tough decisions, and you clearly can't handle it!",2024-09-03 21:54:55
7491,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,"Oh, please. Your ""tough decisions"" just alienate everyone else!",2024-09-03 21:58:55
7492,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more cooperative, it wouldn't come to this!",2024-09-03 22:02:55
7493,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,That's rich coming from the person who dismisses everyone's input!,2024-09-03 22:12:55
7494,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,"If the input was useful, maybe I wouldn't have to dismiss it!",2024-09-03 22:17:55
7495,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,We're not going to succeed if you keep running things like a dictatorship!,2024-09-03 22:21:55
7496,escalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,And we're not going to succeed if you keep acting like a martyr!,2024-09-03 22:28:55
7497,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,"Why do you always take credit for my ideas in our group project, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:12:59
7498,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Jane? Your ideas aren't even that great to begin with!",2024-09-03 21:18:59
7499,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on getting this project done instead of fighting all the time?",2024-09-03 21:27:59
7500,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,"No, this has to be addressed! Alex keeps hijacking my contributions and makes it look like it’s all his work.",2024-09-03 21:28:59
7501,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,"Oh, please. You never speak up during the meetings, so someone has to make decisions around here.",2024-09-03 21:35:59
7502,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,"I didn't speak up because every time I try, you just talk over me!",2024-09-03 21:44:59
7503,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,"Maybe if your ideas were worth listening to, I wouldn’t have to.",2024-09-03 21:47:59
7504,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_3,"Seriously, guys, we need to work together. We're going to fail if we don't start cooperating.",2024-09-03 21:49:59
7505,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,I'm sick of cooperating with someone who doesn't respect me or my work.,2024-09-03 21:52:59
7506,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,Respect? You haven’t done anything to earn it.,2024-09-03 21:58:59
7507,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_3,"This isn't helping. We have a deadline, remember?",2024-09-03 22:02:59
7508,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,"Fine, but if things don't change, I'm going to talk to the professor about Alex's behavior.",2024-09-03 22:07:59
7509,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,"Do whatever you want, Jane. Maybe the professor will agree that you haven't been pulling your weight.",2024-09-03 22:09:59
7510,escalatory_conversation_508,speaker_3,Enough! Let's just break for now and come back to this when we can be more civil.,2024-09-03 22:12:59
7511,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were going to skip practice today?,2024-09-03 21:11:02
7512,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,Because it's none of your business what I do in my free time.,2024-09-03 21:21:02
7513,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"Oh really? When your actions affect the whole team, it's everyone's business!",2024-09-03 21:30:02
7514,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,"Maybe if the coach didn't favor you all the time, I'd actually care about showing up!",2024-09-03 21:31:02
7515,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,That's ridiculous. Everyone knows you get plenty of playtime.,2024-09-03 21:34:02
7516,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,Easy for you to say when you're the captain. You have no idea what it's like for the rest of us.,2024-09-03 21:39:02
7517,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,I'm captain because I work hard and show up. Maybe you should try that sometime.,2024-09-03 21:42:02
7518,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,Work hard? Don't make me laugh. You only got captain because your dad donates money to the team.,2024-09-03 21:50:02
7519,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"How dare you bring my dad into this? That's low, even for you.",2024-09-03 21:57:02
7520,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,It's the truth. Everyone talks about it behind your back.,2024-09-03 22:06:02
7521,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"Well, maybe you should say it to my face instead of hiding behind your excuses.",2024-09-03 22:11:02
7522,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,"You really want to do this now? Fine, let's go. You think you're better than everyone!",2024-09-03 22:17:02
7523,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"No, I just expect people to have some commitment and not let the team down.",2024-09-03 22:21:02
7524,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,Ha! Commitment? Coming from the person who's had everything handed to them?,2024-09-03 22:23:02
7525,escalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"I've earned my place. Unlike you, who",2024-09-03 22:31:02
7526,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball during the game, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:05:06
7527,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,"Because you always miss the shot, Sarah!",2024-09-03 21:09:06
7528,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,That's not true! I've been practicing and getting better!,2024-09-03 21:15:06
7529,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,"Oh sure, practicing while we all watch, right?",2024-09-03 21:18:06
7530,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_3,Can you two stop already? We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 21:26:06
7531,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"Well, it's hard to feel like a team when someone hogs the ball!",2024-09-03 21:27:06
7532,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,"Maybe if someone would make the effort to get open, I wouldn't have to!",2024-09-03 21:33:06
7533,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_4,"Guys, this isn't helping. We need to focus on winning, not fighting.",2024-09-03 21:42:06
7534,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one getting blamed every time.",2024-09-03 21:47:06
7535,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,"I'm not blaming you, I'm stating facts. We're losing because of missed opportunities!",2024-09-03 21:53:06
7536,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,It's not just me missing opportunities. You miss shots too!,2024-09-03 21:59:06
7537,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn't going anywhere. We should be discussing strategy, not arguing.",2024-09-03 22:07:06
7538,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_4,"Yeah, coach is going to bench us if we don't get our act together.",2024-09-03 22:10:06
7539,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"Fine, but Alex needs to trust his teammates more.",2024-09-03 22:19:06
7540,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,I'll trust you when you show me you can perform under pressure.,2024-09-03 22:27:06
7541,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"And I'll show you, if you give me the chance!",2024-09-03 22:36:06
7542,escalatory_conversation_510,speaker_3,Can we at least agree to work together for the next game?,2024-09-03 22:46:06
7543,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot to submit the application for our project funding, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:13:09
7544,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sam. I've been handling so many tasks for this project already. Why didn't you remind me?",2024-09-03 21:21:09
7545,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,"It's not my job to babysit you, Alex! You knew the deadline was approaching.",2024-09-03 21:29:09
7546,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,Babysit? Are you kidding me? I've been doing most of the work while you've been nitpicking over the smallest details.,2024-09-03 21:32:09
7547,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_3,"Guys, can you both calm down? Pointing fingers won't get us anywhere.",2024-09-03 21:33:09
7548,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,"No, Claire, this is serious. We might lose our funding because of Alex's incompetence.",2024-09-03 21:41:09
7549,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,"Incompetence? If you didn't waste our time with pointless meetings, I would have had enough time to submit it!",2024-09-03 21:45:09
7550,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_3,"Alex, Sam, accusing each other isn't helping. We need to figure out what we're going to do next.",2024-09-03 21:53:09
7551,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,Fine. But Alex needs to understand the gravity of this mess-up.,2024-09-03 22:00:09
7552,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,"I understand just fine, Sam. Maybe you need to understand that teamwork means supporting each other, not just criticizing.",2024-09-03 22:03:09
7553,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_3,"Look, we need to find a way to appeal or resubmit the application. Arguing won't solve anything.",2024-09-03 22:12:09
7554,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,"And how do you propose we do that, Claire? The deadline has passed!",2024-09-03 22:15:09
7555,escalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,We could try contacting the board,2024-09-03 22:20:09
7556,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were planning to switch our project topic without discussing it with me first?,2024-09-03 21:09:14
7557,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,Because we kept going around in circles and wasting time! Someone had to make a decision.,2024-09-03 21:10:14
7558,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,But you know I was still researching our original topic. Now all my work is useless!,2024-09-03 21:11:14
7559,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,"Maybe if you had been quicker with your research, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:21:14
7560,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,That's not fair! I had other classes and assignments too. You think only your time is valuable?,2024-09-03 21:25:14
7561,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,At least I'm trying to get things done. You're just dragging your feet.,2024-09-03 21:28:14
7562,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"You're acting like a dictator, making decisions without consulting me. What kind of partnership is this?",2024-09-03 21:30:14
7563,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,"A partnership that needs progress, not endless debates. Are you even serious about this project?",2024-09-03 21:37:14
7564,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"How dare you question my commitment? I've put in just as much effort as you, if not more!",2024-09-03 21:40:14
7565,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,Effort? You mean going off on tangents and holding us back?,2024-09-03 21:45:14
7566,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"You know what? If this is how you're going to be, maybe we shouldn't be partners at all.",2024-09-03 21:50:14
7567,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,Maybe we shouldn’t. I'm sick of having to carry this load by myself.,2024-09-03 22:00:14
7568,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"Fine, let’s tell the professor we’re splitting up the project then. See how far you get on your own.",2024-09-03 22:02:14
7569,escalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,Fine by,2024-09-03 22:05:14
7570,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,Why did you even bother coming to the practice if you're just going to stand around doing nothing?,2024-09-03 21:09:17
7571,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,"I'm not just standing around, I'm actually trying to focus on my technique.",2024-09-03 21:17:17
7572,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,Focus on your technique? By ignoring the drills and making us pick up your slack?,2024-09-03 21:18:17
7573,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_3,"Both of you, this isn't helping the team. We need to work together, not against each other.",2024-09-03 21:19:17
7574,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,I'm just tired of feeling like I'm carrying the team.,2024-09-03 21:27:17
7575,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,"Maybe if you communicated better, we wouldn't have these misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 21:34:17
7576,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault for trying to do too much?",2024-09-03 21:43:17
7577,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,"If you'd stop being so dramatic and actually talked to us, maybe we'd know what you need.",2024-09-03 21:49:17
7578,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_3,Enough! We need to figure out how to work as a unit. This fighting isn't solving anything.,2024-09-03 21:51:17
7579,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,"Fine, but what do you suggest we do? Pretend everything's fine when it's not?",2024-09-03 21:59:17
7580,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,"No, we need clear roles and better communication. That's the only way we're going to improve.",2024-09-03 22:00:17
7581,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,"Alright, then let's set some rules. Because I'm tired of this chaos.",2024-09-03 22:05:17
7582,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's start fresh and figure out how we can support each other better.,2024-09-03 22:10:17
7583,escalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,I'm in. But we can't let it get to this point again. We have to talk before it gets out of hand,2024-09-03 22:20:17
7584,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"I can’t believe you just bailed on the group project meeting, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:13:21
7585,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"Oh come on, Jamie. I had something come up.",2024-09-03 21:19:21
7586,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"Something come up? We've been planning this for weeks, and you just flake out without even telling anyone?",2024-09-03 21:25:21
7587,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"It was an emergency, okay? Do I need to get into details?",2024-09-03 21:35:21
7588,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. Arguing isn’t going to help us finish this project.",2024-09-03 21:42:21
7589,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, Mia. It's between me and Alex.",2024-09-03 21:52:21
7590,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"No, Jamie, Mia’s right. But you always act like you’re the only one who cares.",2024-09-03 21:55:21
7591,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"Because I do the most work! Look at the last project, who pulled the all-nighter?",2024-09-03 22:00:21
7592,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_3,We all contribute in different ways. Let’s figure out a way to make this work without tearing each other apart.,2024-09-03 22:09:21
7593,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"Fine, but Alex needs to start taking responsibility. This is our grade on the line.",2024-09-03 22:16:21
7594,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,Responsibility? I’m the one who got us the interview with the expert. What did you do?,2024-09-03 22:22:21
7595,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"That’s not enough! They could have canceled on us at the last minute, and we’d be screwed.",2024-09-03 22:32:21
7596,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_3,Can't we just agree that we all have strengths and weaknesses? Why don’t we split the tasks differently?,2024-09-03 22:37:21
7597,escalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,And,2024-09-03 22:42:21
7598,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting today?,2024-09-03 21:08:24
7599,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"Because I had other important things to do, unlike you who has all the time in the world.",2024-09-03 21:12:24
7600,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,"Oh, so my time isn't important now? This project is due in two days!",2024-09-03 21:22:24
7601,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,And whose fault is that for procrastinating until the last minute?,2024-09-03 21:30:24
7602,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,"Are you kidding me? I've been working on this since day one, you're the one who hasn't contributed anything!",2024-09-03 21:39:24
7603,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, more people would help out!",2024-09-03 21:49:24
7604,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,Control freak? I'm just trying to make sure we don't fail because of your laziness!,2024-09-03 21:52:24
7605,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"Laziness? It's called prioritizing, something you clearly don't understand.",2024-09-03 21:54:24
7606,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,"Prioritizing? Like what, binge-watching TV shows?",2024-09-03 22:02:24
7607,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,At least I'm not stressing everyone out with constant reminders and emails.,2024-09-03 22:07:24
7608,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,Reminders you apparently need because you can't remember simple deadlines!,2024-09-03 22:10:24
7609,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,Simple deadlines? This whole project is overcomplicated thanks to you!,2024-09-03 22:12:24
7610,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,It's complicated because it's important! Maybe you should start caring for once.,2024-09-03 22:14:24
7611,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,Maybe you should chill out and let people breathe.,2024-09-03 22:21:24
7612,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,Fine! Let's breathe and watch this project go down in flames thanks to your attitude.,2024-09-03 22:24:24
7613,escalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,Fine by me! Better than being micromanaged to death,2024-09-03 22:30:24
7614,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,You really think you can just skip out on band practice whenever you feel like it?,2024-09-03 21:08:28
7615,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. I had a lot of homework. Plus, one practice isn’t going to ruin us.",2024-09-03 21:18:28
7616,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,"It’s not just one practice, and you know it. This is the third time this month!",2024-09-03 21:25:28
7617,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_3,I have to agree with speaker_1. We’re never going to get our timing right if someone’s always missing.,2024-09-03 21:32:28
7618,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,Timing? Seriously? It’s not like we’re performing at Carnegie Hall! Relax a bit.,2024-09-03 21:39:28
7619,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_4,"That’s exactly the problem, speaker_2. We can't improve if you're not committed.",2024-09-03 21:42:28
7620,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,Don’t act like you’re all so perfect. I saw speaker_3 slacking off last week too.,2024-09-03 21:46:28
7621,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_3,Slacking off? At least I show up. You’re deflecting the issue here.,2024-09-03 21:49:28
7622,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,We need to decide if you’re in this or not. We can’t keep accommodating your absences.,2024-09-03 21:54:28
7623,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,"Fine, then! Maybe I don’t need to be part of a band that doesn't understand my other commitments.",2024-09-03 22:02:28
7624,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_4,It’s not about not understanding. It’s about respect for everyone’s time and effort.,2024-09-03 22:07:28
7625,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_3,What’s the point of practicing if we’re never at full strength? It’s frustrating for all of us who care.,2024-09-03 22:16:28
7626,escalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,You,2024-09-03 22:22:28
7627,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted your own design without even telling me!,2024-09-03 21:14:31
7628,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault for wanting to win the competition? You were dragging your feet, as usual.",2024-09-03 21:23:31
7629,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,"Dragging my feet? You barely contributed to the original design, and now you think you can take all the credit!",2024-09-03 21:31:31
7630,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,Maybe because your ideas were outdated and wouldn’t have won us anything. I just wanted us to have a real shot.,2024-09-03 21:33:31
7631,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,Real shot? You mean you wanted to hog all the glory for yourself. This was supposed to be a team project!,2024-09-03 21:35:31
7632,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,It was a team project until you decided to micromanage everything. I couldn’t get a word in edgewise!,2024-09-03 21:38:31
7633,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,Micromanage? Someone had to make sure we stayed on track. You were never around for the meetings.,2024-09-03 21:43:31
7634,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"Because they were a waste of time! You never listen to anyone else's ideas, it's always about you and your so-called vision.",2024-09-03 21:52:31
7635,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,At least I have a vision. All you do is criticize without offering any real solutions.,2024-09-03 21:59:31
7636,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"I offered plenty of solutions, but you shot them all down. Face it, you can't stand the thought of someone else getting credit.",2024-09-03 22:02:31
7637,escalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,"That’s not true. I just want us to win fairly, as a team, not through some backhanded solo effort.",2024-09-03 22:03:31
7638,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"Why did you take my charger without asking, again?",2024-09-03 21:05:34
7639,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,"It's not just your charger, we both use it!",2024-09-03 21:14:34
7640,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"But I needed it, you should've asked first!",2024-09-03 21:23:34
7641,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,I needed it too! You're always hogging it!,2024-09-03 21:33:34
7642,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"That's because my phone dies faster, you know that!",2024-09-03 21:37:34
7643,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,"Oh, sure, like your emergency is more important than mine!",2024-09-03 21:39:34
7644,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"Every time, you just assume it’s okay to take my stuff!",2024-09-03 21:40:34
7645,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,"It’s not just your stuff! We share everything else, why not this?",2024-09-03 21:44:34
7646,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"Because this is different, we've talked about this before!",2024-09-03 21:45:34
7647,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,Clearly talking doesn't work if you keep overreacting like this!,2024-09-03 21:48:34
7648,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,Overreacting? You never respect my boundaries!,2024-09-03 21:54:34
7649,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,Maybe because your boundaries are unreasonable!,2024-09-03 22:03:34
7650,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"Oh, so now I'm unreasonable? Great.",2024-09-03 22:13:34
7651,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,"Yeah, you are! If you can't handle sharing a simple charger, what does that say about you?",2024-09-03 22:23:34
7652,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"It says I value personal space, unlike you!",2024-09-03 22:31:34
7653,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't have to take your stuff if you learned to compromise!,2024-09-03 22:41:34
7654,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,Compromise? You don't even know what that means!,2024-09-03 22:51:34
7655,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,And you don’t know how to communicate without blowing up!,2024-09-03 22:59:34
7656,escalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if you listened, I",2024-09-03 23:06:34
7657,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back to the boss about the project.,2024-09-03 21:10:37
7658,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault that the project is failing? You weren't getting anything done!",2024-09-03 21:11:37
7659,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,That's not true! I've been working overtime trying to fix the mess you made!,2024-09-03 21:13:37
7660,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,The mess I made? You never communicated any of your plans to the team!,2024-09-03 21:22:37
7661,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,"That’s because every time I tried, you just shut me down and did your own thing!",2024-09-03 21:32:37
7662,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"Maybe if your ideas weren't so half-baked, I'd consider them!",2024-09-03 21:42:37
7663,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,Half-baked? At least I come up with solutions instead of just criticizing others!,2024-09-03 21:48:37
7664,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,You call those solutions? More like disasters waiting to happen!,2024-09-03 21:58:37
7665,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,"You know what? If you think you can do better, why don't you manage the project yourself?",2024-09-03 21:59:37
7666,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,Maybe I will! At least then we wouldn't be scrambling at the last minute!,2024-09-03 22:01:37
7667,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,Fine! Good luck trying to fix everything without any of my input!,2024-09-03 22:08:37
7668,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"Don't worry, I think we'll manage just fine without your half-efforts.",2024-09-03 22:10:37
7669,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,This isn't over. I'll be talking to the boss about how you're dragging the team down!,2024-09-03 22:15:37
7670,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,Go ahead! Maybe then they'll see who the real problem is around here!,2024-09-03 22:22:37
7671,escalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,Don't act like you're not part of the problem. You always undermine everyone,2024-09-03 22:28:37
7672,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,Did you really think it was a good idea to change our group project topic without consulting us?,2024-09-03 21:07:40
7673,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,"Well, someone needed to take charge. You guys were just sitting around doing nothing.",2024-09-03 21:14:40
7674,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_3,"That's not true! We were still brainstorming, and now we have no idea about this new topic.",2024-09-03 21:15:40
7675,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,"Exactly, and now we're all scrambling to catch up because you decided to play boss.",2024-09-03 21:18:40
7676,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,"Maybe if you two actually stepped up and took some initiative, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:28:40
7677,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_3,Initiative? You mean like bulldozing over everyone else's opinions?,2024-09-03 21:33:40
7678,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,"We need to work as a team, not have one person making unilateral decisions.",2024-09-03 21:36:40
7679,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,"Well, it's clear that unless I make decisions, nothing gets done.",2024-09-03 21:40:40
7680,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_3,That's not fair. You didn't even give us a chance to vote on it.,2024-09-03 21:48:40
7681,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,And now we're stuck with a topic that none of us are prepared for. We might fail because of this.,2024-09-03 21:55:40
7682,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,"Oh please, the original topic was so boring, it wouldn't have made a difference.",2024-09-03 22:00:40
7683,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_3,Better boring than something we're not ready for!,2024-09-03 22:02:40
7684,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,We could have at least discussed alternatives together!,2024-09-03 22:12:40
7685,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,Discussion? All I heard was endless debate with no progress.,2024-09-03 22:16:40
7686,escalatory_conversation_520,speaker_3,Maybe because it’s called teamwork! We were trying to find a solution that worked for all of,2024-09-03 22:20:40
7687,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the band rehearsal yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:06:43
7688,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,I had other commitments. It's not like you were perfect at the last rehearsal either.,2024-09-03 21:10:43
7689,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"Are you serious? I rearranged my whole schedule for this band, and you're just blowing it off!",2024-09-03 21:19:43
7690,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,"Blowing it off? I've put in just as much effort, if not more!",2024-09-03 21:24:43
7691,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,Both of you need to chill. We won't get anywhere if we're fighting.,2024-09-03 21:32:43
7692,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're always the last one to practice and you never say a word.",2024-09-03 21:33:43
7693,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,Maybe because I don't have the time to deal with all this drama!,2024-09-03 21:37:43
7694,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,"Drama? You're not helping either, just sitting back and letting us pick up the slack.",2024-09-03 21:42:43
7695,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,I'm doing what I can. How about you focus on your own issues?,2024-09-03 21:44:43
7696,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,This is exactly why we're never going to get anywhere. No one wants to take responsibility or communicate properly!,2024-09-03 21:46:43
7697,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so bossy all the time, we'd be more inclined to cooperate!",2024-09-03 21:48:43
7698,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,"Cooperation? We're supposed to be a team, not a bunch of individuals throwing blame around.",2024-09-03 21:57:43
7699,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"Then act like it! Start showing up and doing your part, all of you!",2024-09-03 22:03:43
7700,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,Why don't you lead by example and stop nitpicking everything we do?,2024-09-03 22:06:43
7701,escalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,We're going in,2024-09-03 22:13:43
7702,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were submitting the group project without my input?,2024-09-03 21:10:46
7703,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,"Because every time I ask for your input, you never respond on time!",2024-09-03 21:19:46
7704,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,"That's not true! I've been busy with other classes, but I always give my feedback eventually.",2024-09-03 21:27:46
7705,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,"Eventually isn't good enough when we have deadlines, you know?",2024-09-03 21:32:46
7706,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if you actually communicated better, I wouldn't be left out of the loop!",2024-09-03 21:37:46
7707,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,Communicated better? I'm the one who's been trying to reach you for days!,2024-09-03 21:45:46
7708,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,And I'm supposed to drop everything just because you suddenly want my opinion last minute?,2024-09-03 21:49:46
7709,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,"Last minute? I gave you plenty of notice, and you still didn't respond!",2024-09-03 21:58:46
7710,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,"Maybe because your ""plenty of notice"" is still not enough time for me given my other commitments!",2024-09-03 22:03:46
7711,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault you can't manage your time properly?",2024-09-03 22:12:46
7712,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,"Don't you dare put this on me! If you think you're so perfect, why didn't you just do the whole thing yourself?",2024-09-03 22:17:46
7713,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,"Maybe I should have, considering how unreliable you are!",2024-09-03 22:24:46
7714,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,"Fine! Next time, don't even bother asking me. Do the whole project yourself if you think you're so capable.",2024-09-03 22:27:46
7715,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,Maybe I will! At least then I'll know it gets done right!,2024-09-03 22:37:46
7716,escalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,Whatever. I'm done with,2024-09-03 22:45:46
7717,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were planning on quitting the band?,2024-09-03 21:06:49
7718,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,"Because you never listen to me anyway! Every time I bring something up, you just brush it off.",2024-09-03 21:07:49
7719,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,"That's not true! I do listen, but this is a huge decision. We all deserve to know.",2024-09-03 21:10:49
7720,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,Deserve to know? You barely even notice when I'm there or not. It's like I’m invisible to you all.,2024-09-03 21:13:49
7721,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_3,"Look, this isn't fair. We're supposed to be a team. We've got shows lined up, and we need to know if someone's not committed!",2024-09-03 21:17:49
7722,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,"Committed? Seriously? I've been committed since day one, but it's always your way or the highway.",2024-09-03 21:22:49
7723,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,"We are a team, and that includes making sure everyone is on the same page. You're acting like we don't care about you.",2024-09-03 21:24:49
7724,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,Maybe because it feels like you don't! Do you even realize how exhausting it is to be constantly sidelined?,2024-09-03 21:27:49
7725,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_3,"Sidelined? We've given you solos, we've featured you in promotions. What more do you want?",2024-09-03 21:34:49
7726,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,More than just empty gestures. I want to be heard. I want my ideas to matter without them being shot down immediately.,2024-09-03 21:44:49
7727,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,"So, this is about your ideas? Why didn't you bring them up in our meetings?",2024-09-03 21:45:49
7728,escalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,"Every time I do, you either ignore them or think",2024-09-03 21:54:49
7729,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the presentation, Adam. We were counting on you!",2024-09-03 21:09:52
7730,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,"I had something important come up, Emily. You knew about it.",2024-09-03 21:14:52
7731,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_3,"Adam, this was a team project. Your ""important"" things shouldn't come before our grade.",2024-09-03 21:22:52
7732,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,I told you guys in advance! It's not like I disappeared without a word.,2024-09-03 21:24:52
7733,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_4,What? One vague text message doesn't count as proper notice!,2024-09-03 21:27:52
7734,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,Exactly! You left us hanging. Do you know how embarrassing it was?,2024-09-03 21:33:52
7735,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,"Look, it's not my fault you couldn't handle it without me.",2024-09-03 21:37:52
7736,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_3,That's rich coming from the guy who didn't even do his part.,2024-09-03 21:44:52
7737,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_4,"You always do this, Adam. You never take our projects seriously.",2024-09-03 21:49:52
7738,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,Maybe I don't take them seriously because you guys always blame me for everything!,2024-09-03 21:50:52
7739,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,We're blaming you because you never pull your weight.,2024-09-03 21:59:52
7740,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_3,"If you didn't want to be part of the team, you should've said so from the start.",2024-09-03 22:03:52
7741,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,I'm sick of defending myself to you all. Maybe I'm better off without this group.,2024-09-03 22:09:52
7742,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_4,"Fine, maybe we are better off without you too!",2024-09-03 22:11:52
7743,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,"Then leave, Adam. We'll figure things out on our own.",2024-09-03 22:19:52
7744,escalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,"Don't worry, I'm out. Good luck handling everything without someone to blame!",2024-09-03 22:28:52
7745,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,"You're always hogging the ball, Jason. We can't win a game if you don't pass.",2024-09-03 21:10:55
7746,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,"That's not true, Emily. Every time I pass, you just fumble it and lose possession.",2024-09-03 21:11:55
7747,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_3,Both of you need to stop pointing fingers. We lose because we're not playing as a team!,2024-09-03 21:17:55
7748,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,"See, even Mark agrees. Jason, just admit it—you're a ball hog.",2024-09-03 21:23:55
7749,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,"And you can admit you're too slow to keep up, Emily. Maybe that's why you're always open.",2024-09-03 21:32:55
7750,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_3,"This isn't helping. Coach said we need to communicate better, not tear each other down.",2024-09-03 21:33:55
7751,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, Mark. You're the coach's favorite. You don't have to deal with Jason ignoring you on the field.",2024-09-03 21:40:55
7752,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,"Oh yeah? Maybe if you learned to catch, everyone would pass to you more.",2024-09-03 21:44:55
7753,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_3,"Enough, both of you! The issue is our teamwork, not individual mistakes. Let's focus on fixing that.",2024-09-03 21:49:55
7754,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,"We're talking about teamwork, Mark. And Jason failing to pass is a team issue.",2024-09-03 21:58:55
7755,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,"And how is Emily fumbling every pass not a team issue, huh?",2024-09-03 22:06:55
7756,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_3,Can we stop blaming each other for one second and actually discuss how to improve our passes and catches?,2024-09-03 22:12:55
7757,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,"Fine, but Jason needs to trust his teammates more.",2024-09-03 22:22:55
7758,escalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,And Emily,2024-09-03 22:30:55
7759,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you changed the meeting time without telling me, Matt.",2024-09-03 21:14:57
7760,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,"Sarah, I did tell you! I sent an email yesterday!",2024-09-03 21:18:57
7761,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"No, you didn't. I checked my inbox, and there's nothing from you.",2024-09-03 21:22:57
7762,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,Maybe you didn't check properly. You always miss stuff like this.,2024-09-03 21:24:57
7763,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,Excuse me? Are you seriously blaming me for your lack of communication?,2024-09-03 21:25:57
7764,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,"I'm just saying that if you paid more attention, we wouldn't have these problems.",2024-09-03 21:30:57
7765,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"This isn't about me not paying attention, it's about you not respecting my time!",2024-09-03 21:36:57
7766,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,"Oh, please! You're the one who always shows up late anyway.",2024-09-03 21:37:57
7767,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"That's because I'm overloaded with work, which would be easier if you pulled your weight!",2024-09-03 21:43:57
7768,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,"And there it is, blaming me for your poor time management. Typical!",2024-09-03 21:51:57
7769,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"You know what, Matt? I'm done with this. If you can't work as a team, maybe you shouldn't be here.",2024-09-03 21:55:57
7770,escalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,Fine by me! I don't need to be babysitting you either!,2024-09-03 21:58:57
7771,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took credit for my presentation, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:12:00
7772,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,"Oh, please, Mark. You barely did any work on it.",2024-09-03 21:17:00
7773,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,Are you kidding me? I spent all weekend on those slides!,2024-09-03 21:24:00
7774,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,And I spent every evening last week doing the research. You just put it together.,2024-09-03 21:29:00
7775,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,Putting it together is a huge part of the work! You can't just brush that off.,2024-09-03 21:35:00
7776,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,"Well, it doesn't matter now. The boss has already praised me for it.",2024-09-03 21:41:00
7777,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,That's exactly the problem! You let her think it was all you.,2024-09-03 21:43:00
7778,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were better at presenting, you would've gotten some credit.",2024-09-03 21:50:00
7779,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,"That’s really low, Sarah. You know public speaking isn't my strong suit.",2024-09-03 21:51:00
7780,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,Then maybe you should stick to what you’re good at and let me handle the presentations.,2024-09-03 21:56:00
7781,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,"Oh, so now I'm supposed to do all the grunt work while you take the spotlight?",2024-09-03 22:06:00
7782,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,"If that's what it takes for our projects to succeed, then yes.",2024-09-03 22:07:00
7783,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,This isn't about the project anymore. This is about you wanting all the glory.,2024-09-03 22:16:00
7784,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,You can believe what you want. I'm done talking about this.,2024-09-03 22:26:00
7785,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,"No, we're not done. We need to go to HR and sort this out.",2024-09-03 22:29:00
7786,escalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,"Fine, if you want to",2024-09-03 22:35:00
7787,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"Why didn't you finish the report like you promised, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:07:03
7788,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"I had other things to do, Tom. Do you think you're the only one with responsibilities?",2024-09-03 21:09:03
7789,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"We agreed on deadlines, Sam. This affects the whole project!",2024-09-03 21:13:03
7790,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault? What about the times you were late with your parts?",2024-09-03 21:19:03
7791,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"Those were different situations, and you know it. I always kept the team informed.",2024-09-03 21:24:03
7792,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"Informed or not, it still put us behind schedule. What's the difference this time?",2024-09-03 21:25:03
7793,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"The difference is we had a client to impress today, and now we look unprofessional.",2024-09-03 21:27:03
7794,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't micromanage everything, we could get things done faster!",2024-09-03 21:37:03
7795,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,Micromanage? Someone has to make sure things are done right when you keep dropping the ball.,2024-09-03 21:38:03
7796,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,Dropping the ball? Seriously? I’ve been covering for your mistakes for weeks!,2024-09-03 21:41:03
7797,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"Look, Sam, if you can't handle the pressure, maybe this isn't the right job for you.",2024-09-03 21:49:03
7798,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"And maybe if you weren't so controlling, we'd actually work better as a team!",2024-09-03 21:56:03
7799,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"It's called leadership, Sam. Learn to appreciate it.",2024-09-03 22:00:03
7800,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,Leadership? More like dictatorship. No one can work under these conditions.,2024-09-03 22:07:03
7801,escalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,Fine! If you think you can do a,2024-09-03 22:08:03
7802,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,"Why is it that every time we work on a group project, you never pull your weight, Jake?",2024-09-03 21:13:07
7803,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Lisa! That's not true. I always do my part.",2024-09-03 21:15:07
7804,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,Really? Then where's your research for the presentation? The deadline is tomorrow!,2024-09-03 21:16:07
7805,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"I have other classes too, you know. It's not just about your precious presentation.",2024-09-03 21:24:07
7806,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_3,"Guys, can we calm down and just split the remaining tasks? Arguing isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:30:07
7807,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,"Eric, you don't get it. This happens every single time. Jake always finds an excuse.",2024-09-03 21:38:07
7808,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"And you always play the victim, Lisa. It's getting old.",2024-09-03 21:42:07
7809,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_3,"Seriously, can we just focus on getting this done? Finger-pointing won't finish our project.",2024-09-03 21:47:07
7810,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,"Fine, but Jake, you better step up this time. No more slack.",2024-09-03 21:49:07
7811,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"Whatever, Lisa. I'm tired of your constant nagging.",2024-09-03 21:58:07
7812,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_3,Enough! Who can handle what tasks so we can move forward?,2024-09-03 22:07:07
7813,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,"I'll finalize the slides, but Jake has to provide his research by tonight.",2024-09-03 22:15:07
7814,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,I said I'll get it done. Just drop it already.,2024-09-03 22:17:07
7815,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_3,Good. Then it's settled. Let's all just do our parts and stop blaming each other.,2024-09-03 22:23:07
7816,escalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,I'll believe it when I see it. Let's wrap this up.,2024-09-03 22:29:07
7817,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pick me up from the airport, Brian! You knew I was arriving today!",2024-09-03 21:12:10
7818,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. I was stuck in traffic, and you should have just taken a taxi like an adult.",2024-09-03 21:17:10
7819,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,A taxi? Do you have any idea how much luggage I had? You promised you'd be there!,2024-09-03 21:25:10
7820,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"Promised? I didn't sign a contract, Sarah. Sometimes things come up.",2024-09-03 21:33:10
7821,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,"Things come up, or you just don't care enough to keep your word?",2024-09-03 21:42:10
7822,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,Seriously? You're going to question how much I care about you over one missed airport pickup?,2024-09-03 21:50:10
7823,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,It's not just about this one time! You keep dropping the ball on everything.,2024-09-03 21:55:10
7824,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"That's rich coming from you, the queen of broken promises. When was the last time you followed through on anything?",2024-09-03 22:05:10
7825,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,At least I try! You just shrug and move on like nothing happened. It's infuriating!,2024-09-03 22:08:10
7826,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't always criticizing me, I'd be more inclined to make more of an effort!",2024-09-03 22:13:10
7827,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,"Criticizing you? Maybe if you actually did what you said you would, I wouldn’t have to!",2024-09-03 22:21:10
7828,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,I'm done with this conversation. You're impossible to talk to.,2024-09-03 22:24:10
7829,escalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,"Fine, walk away as usual. That's all you're good at.",2024-09-03 22:34:10
7830,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you show up for the group project meeting, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:15:13
7831,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"I had other things to do, Claire. It’s not like I’m the only one in the group.",2024-09-03 21:23:13
7832,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"We all have schedules to manage, but you can’t just bail and expect us to pick up the slack.",2024-09-03 21:31:13
7833,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"Oh, like you’re any better? You missed the meeting last week, remember?",2024-09-03 21:32:13
7834,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on finishing the project? This isn’t helping.",2024-09-03 21:40:13
7835,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"Don’t change the subject, Jamie. Alex, you keep blowing us off and then act like it’s no big deal.",2024-09-03 21:42:13
7836,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren’t so bossy, I’d actually want to come to these meetings!",2024-09-03 21:49:13
7837,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,Bossy? I’m trying to keep us on track because no one else will!,2024-09-03 21:59:13
7838,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_3,"Seriously, fighting won’t get this project done. Can we just assign tasks and move on?",2024-09-03 22:03:13
7839,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"Fine. Alex, are you even going to contribute, or should we just do it without you?",2024-09-03 22:06:13
7840,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"You know what, Claire? Do it without me. I’m done dealing with your attitude.",2024-09-03 22:13:13
7841,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,Unbelievable. You’re just abandoning your responsibilities?,2024-09-03 22:19:13
7842,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_3,Can we calm down and talk about this like adults?,2024-09-03 22:21:13
7843,escalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"I tried talking, Jamie, but Alex can’t be bothered",2024-09-03 22:27:13
7844,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,"You didn't even bother to check the schedule, did you?",2024-09-03 21:11:15
7845,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"What are you talking about? Of course, I did.",2024-09-03 21:18:15
7846,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,Then why did you miss our meeting with the client this morning?,2024-09-03 21:28:15
7847,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,I didn't miss it! I thought it was rescheduled for the afternoon!,2024-09-03 21:36:15
7848,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,"No, rescheduled was last week. You mixed up the dates again.",2024-09-03 21:40:15
7849,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"This is so typical of you, blaming me for everything that goes wrong.",2024-09-03 21:45:15
7850,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,"Well, if you paid more attention to details, maybe I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 21:53:15
7851,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're perfect? You never make mistakes?",2024-09-03 21:58:15
7852,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,At least I take responsibility for mine!,2024-09-03 22:08:15
7853,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,Responsibility? You mean pointing fingers and finding scapegoats?,2024-09-03 22:18:15
7854,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,I'm just trying to ensure we don't lose our biggest client.,2024-09-03 22:23:15
7855,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,And I'm trying to juggle a million tasks you keep dumping on me!,2024-09-03 22:30:15
7856,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,"If you can’t handle it, maybe you should say something instead of dropping the ball.",2024-09-03 22:36:15
7857,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"Maybe if you communicated better, I wouldn't drop it in the first place!",2024-09-03 22:38:15
7858,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,Communication works both ways. It's not my job to hold your hand through everything!,2024-09-03 22:44:15
7859,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,And it's not my job to cover for your lack of clear instructions!,2024-09-03 22:47:15
7860,escalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,Fine! Maybe we should split the projects and work separately then,2024-09-03 22:52:15
7861,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,"You always leave your dirty dishes in the sink, Sarah. It's driving me nuts!",2024-09-03 21:15:19
7862,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,"Oh really, Mike? Maybe if you actually cleaned up after yourself, I'd be more inclined to help.",2024-09-03 21:17:19
7863,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,That's nonsense! I always clean up my mess. You're just too lazy to do yours.,2024-09-03 21:24:19
7864,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,Lazy? You think I'm lazy? Just because I have more work to do outside of this shared apartment doesn't mean I'm lazy!,2024-09-03 21:26:19
7865,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,More work? Give me a break. You spend hours watching TV and ignoring your responsibilities.,2024-09-03 21:33:19
7866,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,And what about you? You're always playing video games instead of doing anything productive around here.,2024-09-03 21:35:19
7867,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,At least I don't use work as an excuse to avoid chores. You can't just dump everything on me!,2024-09-03 21:42:19
7868,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,"Oh, so now you're the victim? It's rich coming from someone who never takes the trash out on time.",2024-09-03 21:44:19
7869,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,"That's because you never remind me. A little communication could help, you know!",2024-09-03 21:54:19
7870,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,"Communication? I've tried, Mike. You just never listen. You nod and then do nothing.",2024-09-03 22:00:19
7871,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,"Maybe if you weren't so condescending all the time, I might actually listen.",2024-09-03 22:05:19
7872,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,"Condescending? You're the one who's always patronizing, acting like you're better than everyone!",2024-09-03 22:12:19
7873,escalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,I can't believe you're turning this on me. This whole mess started because you can't handle basic,2024-09-03 22:22:19
7874,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,Why did you use my design without asking me?,2024-09-03 21:14:21
7875,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,"Your design? I thought it was part of the shared folder, it’s for everyone to use.",2024-09-03 21:16:21
7876,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,That doesn’t mean you can just claim it like it’s yours! You should have at least asked.,2024-09-03 21:17:21
7877,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,"I needed something quick, there wasn’t time to ask. Relax, it’s not a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:27:21
7878,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,It is a big deal! You’re always taking credit for other people’s work.,2024-09-03 21:34:21
7879,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,"Oh, come off it! You’re just being petty now.",2024-09-03 21:41:21
7880,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,Petty? You’re the one who has no respect for anyone else’s contributions!,2024-09-03 21:48:21
7881,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,"And you’re being overly possessive! We’re supposed to be working as a team, remember?",2024-09-03 21:50:21
7882,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,Teams communicate. You just act like everything belongs to you.,2024-09-03 21:55:21
7883,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,Maybe that's because no one else steps up when things need to get done!,2024-09-03 22:02:21
7884,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,That’s a flat-out lie and you know it.,2024-09-03 22:11:21
7885,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,Whatever. I don’t have time for this pointless argument.,2024-09-03 22:17:21
7886,escalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,Fine. Just don’t expect me to trust you with any of my work in the future.,2024-09-03 22:27:21
7887,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell us you were going to change the project's direction at the last minute?,2024-09-03 21:14:24
7888,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,"Because no one was providing any useful input, so I had to take charge and make a decision.",2024-09-03 21:15:24
7889,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_3,That's just great! Now all the work we've done is useless.,2024-09-03 21:19:24
7890,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,We had a plan. Why go rogue like that without a heads-up?,2024-09-03 21:23:24
7891,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,This is what happens when people can't commit or communicate! I had no choice.,2024-09-03 21:26:24
7892,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_4,No choice? You mean you didn't bother to consult us.,2024-09-03 21:31:24
7893,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_3,And now we're scrambling to meet the deadline because of your unilateral decision.,2024-09-03 21:34:24
7894,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,"If anyone had actually stepped up, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess now.",2024-09-03 21:36:24
7895,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,So now it's our fault that you decided to ignore the team's process?,2024-09-03 21:41:24
7896,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_4,This is a team effort. You can't just override everyone and expect us to be okay with it.,2024-09-03 21:47:24
7897,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,Team effort? More like I'm the only one putting in real effort!,2024-09-03 21:52:24
7898,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_3,That's insulting! We've all been putting in countless hours.,2024-09-03 21:56:24
7899,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_4,This project was supposed to be a collaborative effort. You've completely disregarded that.,2024-09-03 21:59:24
7900,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,"We need to figure out how to fix this together, not go off on separate tangents.",2024-09-03 22:00:24
7901,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,"Fine, what's your grand solution then? More endless meetings that get us nowhere?",2024-09-03 22:05:24
7902,escalatory_conversation_535,speaker_3,How about,2024-09-03 22:12:24
7903,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,Why didn’t you pass the ball to me in the last play?,2024-09-03 21:10:27
7904,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"Because you were nowhere near the goal, I had a better shot!",2024-09-03 21:16:27
7905,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,"Better shot? You missed, didn't you?",2024-09-03 21:26:27
7906,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"Yeah, because I didn't get any support from you!",2024-09-03 21:30:27
7907,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_3,"Guys, we’re falling apart as a team. Can we just discuss this calmly?",2024-09-03 21:32:27
7908,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,Calmly? How can we stay calm when we’re losing because of selfish moves like that?,2024-09-03 21:33:27
7909,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"Selfish moves? I’m trying to win the game, which is more than I can say for some of us.",2024-09-03 21:42:27
7910,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_4,"Hey, focus on the game, not on bringing each other down. We're supposed to work together.",2024-09-03 21:52:27
7911,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,Focus? It’s hard to focus when no one trusts each other on the field.,2024-09-03 21:56:27
7912,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,Trust? How can I trust you when you’re not in the right positions?,2024-09-03 21:59:27
7913,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_3,Attacking each other isn’t going to help. We need to figure out a way to communicate better.,2024-09-03 22:09:27
7914,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_4,Exactly. Let’s talk about positions and strategies so this doesn’t happen again.,2024-09-03 22:17:27
7915,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,"Fine, but we need to admit we’re not playing as a team right now.",2024-09-03 22:21:27
7916,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"Agreed, but finger-pointing isn’t the solution.",2024-09-03 22:24:27
7917,escalatory_conversation_536,speaker_3,How about we all agree to work on passing and positioning during practice,2024-09-03 22:31:27
7918,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,"You can't seriously think that this design will work for the project, can you?",2024-09-03 21:15:30
7919,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,What's wrong with my design? It's better than your messy layout.,2024-09-03 21:25:30
7920,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,Messy? My layout is based on the data and user feedback we got!,2024-09-03 21:31:30
7921,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't so busy critiquing my work, you'd see that your feedback is flawed.",2024-09-03 21:34:30
7922,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_3,Can you two focus for a minute? We're running out of time to finalize this.,2024-09-03 21:42:30
7923,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,We're running out of time because someone won't listen to any suggestions.,2024-09-03 21:48:30
7924,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,"I listen to suggestions that make sense, not ones that are based on outdated techniques.",2024-09-03 21:54:30
7925,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_3,"Enough! Both of you, stop acting like children. We need a solution, not more arguments.",2024-09-03 21:57:30
7926,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,"Maybe if someone acknowledged that my design addresses actual user pain points, we wouldn’t be at this impasse.",2024-09-03 22:06:30
7927,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,"Oh, like you've ever solved a user issue correctly. Your last design had dozens of complaints.",2024-09-03 22:08:30
7928,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,At least my design got deployed. How many of your ideas have even made it past the proposal stage?,2024-09-03 22:10:30
7929,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,That's because you always bulldoze everyone else's contributions!,2024-09-03 22:19:30
7930,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_3,"Seriously, we don't have time for this. We need to decide on something and move forward.",2024-09-03 22:25:30
7931,escalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,"Fine, let's put both designs to a test with a focus group and let the users decide.",2024-09-03 22:29:30
7932,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,Why are you always so sloppy with the code? It’s like you don’t even care about this project!,2024-09-03 21:13:33
7933,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I’ve been pulling my weight just as much as you have!,2024-09-03 21:17:33
7934,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"Really? Because I just spent the last three hours fixing your mistakes, AGAIN!",2024-09-03 21:21:33
7935,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,"Oh, so the one bug you found yesterday is now my fault? Get off your high horse!",2024-09-03 21:24:33
7936,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. Fighting isn’t going to get us anywhere.,2024-09-03 21:28:33
7937,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"Stay out of it, you’re always defending them! It’s like you can’t see how careless they are!",2024-09-03 21:36:33
7938,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,Careless? At least I’m not the one who left the database credentials exposed in the last commit!,2024-09-03 21:38:33
7939,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,That was a one-time mistake! You screw up every other day!,2024-09-03 21:41:33
7940,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_3,"Enough, we need to focus on fixing the issues, not tearing each other apart!",2024-09-03 21:48:33
7941,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,"Maybe if someone could point out my supposed mistakes without being a complete jerk, we could get somewhere.",2024-09-03 21:57:33
7942,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"Oh, now I’m a jerk? How about being just a little more competent?",2024-09-03 22:06:33
7943,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,How about being a little less of a control freak?,2024-09-03 22:09:33
7944,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn’t productive. Let’s just figure out what went wrong and fix it.",2024-09-03 22:17:33
7945,escalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"Fine. But if this keeps happening,",2024-09-03 22:18:33
7946,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"You never take any of my ideas seriously, do you?",2024-09-03 21:06:36
7947,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again. Always the victim.",2024-09-03 21:07:36
7948,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"It's not about being a victim, it's about respect.",2024-09-03 21:08:36
7949,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,Respect? You mean like the respect you showed when you shot down my proposal in front of the entire team?,2024-09-03 21:10:36
7950,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,That proposal was ridiculous and you know it!,2024-09-03 21:13:36
7951,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"Ridiculous to you, maybe, because you think you know everything.",2024-09-03 21:18:36
7952,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,And you think throwing out half-baked ideas makes you a genius?,2024-09-03 21:26:36
7953,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,At least I have ideas. Unlike some people who just complain.,2024-09-03 21:34:36
7954,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"I contribute plenty, but you never listen!",2024-09-03 21:40:36
7955,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"Maybe because your ""contributions"" are more like criticisms.",2024-09-03 21:43:36
7956,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,Criticisms are necessary when someone keeps making the same mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:44:36
7957,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the one making all the mistakes?",2024-09-03 21:51:36
7958,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"If the shoe fits, wear it.",2024-09-03 21:57:36
7959,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"Maybe I should just leave then, since I'm so incompetent in your eyes.",2024-09-03 22:04:36
7960,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"That's not what I said, but if you're going to twist my words, fine!",2024-09-03 22:13:36
7961,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,Twisting your words? I'm just repeating what you said half the time.,2024-09-03 22:22:36
7962,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,You always take everything so personally.,2024-09-03 22:28:36
7963,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,And you always act like you're above everyone.,2024-09-03 22:38:36
7964,escalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,This,2024-09-03 22:44:36
7965,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the band rehearsal yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:09:39
7966,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,I had other plans.,2024-09-03 21:19:39
7967,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,Other plans? We have a big performance next week!,2024-09-03 21:25:39
7968,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,It's not like I missed that much. You guys can manage without me for one rehearsal.,2024-09-03 21:29:39
7969,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_3,"You're always doing this, putting your personal stuff over the band!",2024-09-03 21:33:39
7970,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,"That's not true. I have a life outside this band, you know.",2024-09-03 21:35:39
7971,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_3,"We all do, but we still manage to show up. It's about commitment.",2024-09-03 21:36:39
7972,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,Exactly. You're letting everyone down.,2024-09-03 21:40:39
7973,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,"Oh, like you’re so perfect. What about the time you missed because of your ""family emergency""?",2024-09-03 21:49:39
7974,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_3,"That was one time, and it was actually an emergency!",2024-09-03 21:57:39
7975,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,"Right, and mine wasn’t?",2024-09-03 22:03:39
7976,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,Enough! We need to figure out how to be on the same page. This isn't just about yesterday.,2024-09-03 22:04:39
7977,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,I show up most of the time. One absence and you guys blow it out of proportion.,2024-09-03 22:13:39
7978,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_3,It's not just one absence. It’s a pattern. This isn’t the first time.,2024-09-03 22:14:39
7979,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,You’re just looking for reasons to criticize me.,2024-09-03 22:17:39
7980,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,"No, we’re asking you to be part of the team. Everyone's counting on each other.",2024-09-03 22:23:39
7981,escalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,Maybe I don't want to be part,2024-09-03 22:30:39
7982,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,"I can't believe you're backing out of the project last minute. What the hell, Mark?",2024-09-03 21:08:42
7983,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,"Look, I have my reasons, Sarah. It's not like I wanted this to happen.",2024-09-03 21:13:42
7984,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,Your reasons? You've known about this presentation for weeks. We were counting on you.,2024-09-03 21:21:42
7985,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,Don't make it sound like it's all on me. You didn't exactly pull your weight either.,2024-09-03 21:26:42
7986,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,Excuse me? I stayed up late every night for this. You disappeared for half the meetings!,2024-09-03 21:33:42
7987,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because your ideas were so brilliant. Half of them didn't even make sense!",2024-09-03 21:38:42
7988,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,At least I contributed something. You're bailing because you can't handle the stress.,2024-09-03 21:48:42
7989,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,"Bailing? I'm trying to manage multiple things here! Unlike you, I have other commitments.",2024-09-03 21:54:42
7990,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,"Other commitments? This project was supposed to be important. It's our final grade, Mark!",2024-09-03 22:01:42
7991,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,Don't you lecture me about importance. You think you're the only one who cares?,2024-09-03 22:02:42
7992,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,"If you cared, you'd be here, not coming up with excuses.",2024-09-03 22:05:42
7993,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,"You think it's easy for me? I have a job, family issues—it's not just about school for me.",2024-09-03 22:13:42
7994,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,"We all have problems, Mark. We're supposed to be a team. You should've said something earlier.",2024-09-03 22:23:42
7995,escalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,Maybe I would have if you were,2024-09-03 22:29:42
7996,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,I don't understand why you changed the entire presentation without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:10:45
7997,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"Because your slides were a mess, and we both know it. Someone had to fix it.",2024-09-03 21:18:45
7998,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,That's not your call to make! We were supposed to work on this together.,2024-09-03 21:20:45
7999,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"Well, you weren't doing your part, so I had to step in.",2024-09-03 21:25:45
8000,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,I wasn't doing my part? I've been pulling all-nighters to get this done!,2024-09-03 21:28:45
8001,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"All-nighters or not, it wasn't up to standard. You should be thanking me.",2024-09-03 21:37:45
8002,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,Thanking you? For undermining all my work? You're unbelievable.,2024-09-03 21:39:45
8003,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"Maybe your work wouldn't need ""undermining"" if you actually listened to feedback.",2024-09-03 21:49:45
8004,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,Feedback? All you do is criticize without offering any real solutions!,2024-09-03 21:59:45
8005,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,Real solutions? I just gave you a whole new presentation! That's the solution.,2024-09-03 22:07:45
8006,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,It's not a solution if it disregards my input. We were supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 22:13:45
8007,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,A team where one person does all the work and the other complains? Great team.,2024-09-03 22:21:45
8008,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,You're twisting everything! This isn't about me being lazy; it's about respect!,2024-09-03 22:26:45
8009,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's about respect? What about respecting the quality of our work?",2024-09-03 22:27:45
8010,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,"Quality comes from collaboration, not dictatorship!",2024-09-03 22:36:45
8011,escalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,Coll,2024-09-03 22:40:45
8012,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the client meeting today?,2024-09-03 21:14:48
8013,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,I did tell you! You just weren't paying attention.,2024-09-03 21:15:48
8014,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,"No, you didn't. This is your responsibility to keep us informed.",2024-09-03 21:21:48
8015,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,My responsibility? You're supposed to check the calendar yourself!,2024-09-03 21:26:48
8016,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,I can't believe you're blaming this on me. Do you even take anything seriously?,2024-09-03 21:29:48
8017,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,"Oh, like you're a beacon of professionalism? That's rich.",2024-09-03 21:37:48
8018,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,At least I don't waste time gossiping at work!,2024-09-03 21:43:48
8019,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,Gossiping? You mean actually building relationships with colleagues?,2024-09-03 21:46:48
8020,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,Relationships? More like distractions. That's why we're falling behind on projects.,2024-09-03 21:51:48
8021,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,"If we're falling behind, it's because I'm doing all the heavy lifting while you criticize from the sidelines.",2024-09-03 21:58:48
8022,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,Heavy lifting? You didn't even prepare the presentation slides for last week!,2024-09-03 22:07:48
8023,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,Because you were supposed to handle that part! You're always dropping the ball and blaming others.,2024-09-03 22:15:48
8024,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,Dropping the ball? Look who's talking! I had to redo your budget analysis because of mistakes.,2024-09-03 22:17:48
8025,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,"Maybe if you communicated better, those mistakes wouldn't happen. But no, you're too busy micromanaging!",2024-09-03 22:22:48
8026,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,"Micromanaging? Someone has to, with your careless attitude.",2024-09-03 22:23:48
8027,escalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,I can't believe this. Maybe we should just work separately if we're so incompatible.,2024-09-03 22:31:48
8028,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up for the rehearsal yesterday!,2024-09-03 21:07:51
8029,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,Are you seriously blaming me? You didn't even remind me!,2024-09-03 21:14:51
8030,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,"I shouldn't have to remind you, you're a part of this band too!",2024-09-03 21:21:51
8031,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,"Yeah, well maybe I would care more if you actually listened to my ideas for once!",2024-09-03 21:22:51
8032,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,"Both of you, calm down. We need to focus on getting this gig right, not fighting.",2024-09-03 21:30:51
8033,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, speaker_3. You didn't have to cover for speaker_2's part last night!",2024-09-03 21:37:51
8034,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break! If you think you're so perfect, why don't you try organizing everything for a change?",2024-09-03 21:46:51
8035,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,"This isn't helping. We're all stressed, but shouting won't solve anything.",2024-09-03 21:56:51
8036,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,"Fine, let's talk about how speaker_2 never shows up on time and how that affects all of us.",2024-09-03 22:01:51
8037,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,And let's talk about how speaker_1 monopolizes every single practice session and ignores everyone's input!,2024-09-03 22:03:51
8038,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,We should set some ground rules so everyone feels heard and accountable.,2024-09-03 22:11:51
8039,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,Ground rules won't matter if people keep being unreliable.,2024-09-03 22:18:51
8040,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,And ground rules won't help if some people keep acting like dictators.,2024-09-03 22:20:51
8041,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,"Look, let's just agree to communicate better. We can set up reminders and make sure everyone knows the plan.",2024-09-03 22:26:51
8042,escalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,I'm willing,2024-09-03 22:29:51
8043,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,Why didn’t you pass me the ball during the game?,2024-09-03 21:10:54
8044,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,Maybe because you never make your shots. How about that?,2024-09-03 21:16:54
8045,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,That’s just unfair! I was wide open and you ignored me.,2024-09-03 21:22:54
8046,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,Maybe I ignored you because I knew you’d blow our chances.,2024-09-03 21:24:54
8047,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_3,"Hey, can we focus on what went wrong and fix it together?",2024-09-03 21:29:54
8048,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,"Oh, look, the peacemaker chimes in. This isn't your fight.",2024-09-03 21:33:54
8049,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,We wouldn't need a peacemaker if someone played like a team member.,2024-09-03 21:36:54
8050,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,Me? A team member? You’re the one messing up our plays constantly!,2024-09-03 21:44:54
8051,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_3,"Guys, seriously, pointing fingers isn't helping us win.",2024-09-03 21:51:54
8052,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,"We need to call out bad playing when we see it, or we'll never improve.",2024-09-03 21:52:54
8053,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,You're just deflecting because you can't handle the truth.,2024-09-03 22:01:54
8054,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,"The truth is you're a ball hog, plain and simple.",2024-09-03 22:11:54
8055,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,And you’re just jealous because you can't keep up with my skills.,2024-09-03 22:17:54
8056,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_3,Can we put our egos aside for a second and figure out how to coordinate better?,2024-09-03 22:27:54
8057,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,Maybe we need to figure out who actually belongs on the team.,2024-09-03 22:33:54
8058,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,"You saying I don't belong? That’s low, even for you.",2024-09-03 22:36:54
8059,escalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,"If the shoe fits, wear it.",2024-09-03 22:39:54
8060,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for our band's rehearsal again, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:10:57
8061,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. It was just one rehearsal!",2024-09-03 21:16:57
8062,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_3,"It's not just one rehearsal, Jake. This is the third time this month!",2024-09-03 21:20:57
8063,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,"I have other things to do, you know. Not everything revolves around this stupid band.",2024-09-03 21:23:57
8064,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,Stupid band? Are you serious? We've all been putting so much effort into this!,2024-09-03 21:28:57
8065,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_3,"We have a gig coming up in two weeks, and you're bailing on us?",2024-09-03 21:34:57
8066,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,"Maybe if you guys were more flexible, I wouldn't have to bail.",2024-09-03 21:37:57
8067,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,"Flexible? We're all making sacrifices here, Jake. You're the one who can't commit!",2024-09-03 21:43:57
8068,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_3,We're supposed to be a team! You're letting us all down.,2024-09-03 21:48:57
8069,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,"Oh, like you guys are perfect? I've seen both of you mess up plenty of times.",2024-09-03 21:57:57
8070,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,At least we show up! Your absence is the real problem here.,2024-09-03 22:02:57
8071,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,"Maybe if the practice sessions weren't so boring, I'd be more inclined to come.",2024-09-03 22:03:57
8072,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_3,Boring? We're practicing our setlist for the big gig! How is that boring?,2024-09-03 22:11:57
8073,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,You just keep playing the same songs over and over. It's not challenging enough.,2024-09-03 22:19:57
8074,escalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,We're perfecting them! Do you even care about this band anymore?,2024-09-03 22:26:57
8075,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and held that meeting without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:12:00
8076,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. If I waited for your schedule to clear up, we'd never get anything done.",2024-09-03 21:21:00
8077,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,That's not the point! We agreed we'd make these decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:30:00
8078,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,"Yeah, but sometimes you're too slow to act. We can't wait around forever.",2024-09-03 21:35:00
8079,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_3,"Hold on, both of you. This isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:40:00
8080,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, speaker_3. This is between us.",2024-09-03 21:44:00
8081,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,"No, let them speak. Maybe they see something you don't.",2024-09-03 21:46:00
8082,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_3,Fine. But it seems like neither of you are willing to compromise.,2024-09-03 21:56:00
8083,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,Why should I compromise when speaker_2 keeps undermining me?,2024-09-03 21:58:00
8084,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,Undermining? You're the one dragging us down with your constant need for control.,2024-09-03 22:08:00
8085,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_3,"This is getting out of hand. We're supposed to be a team, not enemies.",2024-09-03 22:10:00
8086,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,"A team means cooperation, not making unilateral decisions.",2024-09-03 22:11:00
8087,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you could be more decisive, I wouldn't have to.",2024-09-03 22:13:00
8088,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn't productive. We need to find a way to work together.",2024-09-03 22:23:00
8089,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,Then speaker_2 needs to respect the agreements we make.,2024-09-03 22:30:00
8090,escalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,And speaker_1 needs to learn to adapt and not hold us back.,2024-09-03 22:34:00
8091,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,Why did you interfere with my presentation? You completely undermined me in front of the entire team!,2024-09-03 21:12:03
8092,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,"Oh please, your presentation was floundering. Someone had to step in and save it.",2024-09-03 21:18:03
8093,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,Save it? All you did was make me look incompetent. I had the situation under control!,2024-09-03 21:23:03
8094,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,Under control? You were stumbling over your words and losing everyone's attention.,2024-09-03 21:26:03
8095,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_3,Can both of you stop it? We're on the same team here!,2024-09-03 21:35:03
8096,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,It's hard to feel like a team when someone can't back off and let me handle my own work!,2024-09-03 21:41:03
8097,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,"Maybe if your work didn't drag the whole team down, I wouldn't have to rescue it.",2024-09-03 21:51:03
8098,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_3,Rescuing it? You just stole the spotlight to show off. How is that teamwork?,2024-09-03 21:57:03
8099,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,"Show off? I was thinking about the project, unlike some people.",2024-09-03 22:03:03
8100,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,Oh really? It always seems like you're more interested in being the star than any project outcome.,2024-09-03 22:07:03
8101,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_3,"We need to find a way to work together, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 22:14:03
8102,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,I'm just trying to prevent us from failing because some people can't keep up.,2024-09-03 22:23:03
8103,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,"Funny, considering you're the one who creates more problems with your so-called 'help.'",2024-09-03 22:31:03
8104,escalatory_conversation_548,speaker_3,"Alright, this isn't getting us anywhere. How about we discuss what went wrong calmly?",2024-09-03 22:40:03
8105,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,"I can't believe you used my research without asking, David.",2024-09-03 21:14:06
8106,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break, Emma. It's not like you were using it.",2024-09-03 21:22:06
8107,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,That's completely disrespectful. You know how important that data is for my thesis!,2024-09-03 21:26:06
8108,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"Important? You barely touch it anyway. I needed it for my project, which, by the way, actually has a deadline.",2024-09-03 21:30:06
8109,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,"That's not the point! It's my work, and you should have asked for permission!",2024-09-03 21:39:06
8110,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,Why should I ask for permission when you hoard all the resources like it's your personal stash?,2024-09-03 21:49:06
8111,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,"Because it's called respect, David. Ever heard of that concept?",2024-09-03 21:50:06
8112,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"Respect? Like when you ""borrowed"" my laptop for a week and messed with my files?",2024-09-03 21:53:06
8113,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,That was different! I told you about that beforehand.,2024-09-03 22:00:06
8114,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"Oh please, you dumped it on me last minute and expected me to be fine with it.",2024-09-03 22:07:06
8115,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,So this is payback? Are you serious right now?,2024-09-03 22:11:06
8116,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,Maybe it is. Maybe I'm tired of you always being so self-centered and entitled.,2024-09-03 22:14:06
8117,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,Entitled? You're the one taking whatever you want without a second thought!,2024-09-03 22:18:06
8118,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"Because unlike you, I actually make use of the resources instead of letting them gather dust!",2024-09-03 22:19:06
8119,escalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,This is ridiculous. You should be ashamed,2024-09-03 22:26:06
8120,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,Why didn't you submit the group project report on time?,2024-09-03 21:10:09
8121,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"Hey, don't blame me! I was waiting for your part!",2024-09-03 21:16:09
8122,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,"My part was done two days ago, and I sent it to you to compile.",2024-09-03 21:22:09
8123,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_3,"Guys, we all had our responsibilities. Let's figure out what went wrong.",2024-09-03 21:32:09
8124,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"Don't act like you're not responsible, too! Your section had so many errors, I had to fix them.",2024-09-03 21:41:09
8125,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault you didn't work faster?",2024-09-03 21:42:09
8126,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_3,Can we stop pointing fingers and just focus on what happened?,2024-09-03 21:50:09
8127,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"You know what, maybe if everyone did their job properly, this wouldn't be an issue!",2024-09-03 21:53:09
8128,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,"Maybe if you'd communicate better, we wouldn't be falling behind!",2024-09-03 21:58:09
8129,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_3,This isn't helping. How can we fix this now?,2024-09-03 22:02:09
8130,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,Fix it? We're already screwed thanks to you two.,2024-09-03 22:07:09
8131,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,Unbelievable! You were supposed to be the lead on this!,2024-09-03 22:08:09
8132,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_3,Both of you need to calm down. Blaming each other doesn’t solve anything.,2024-09-03 22:18:09
8133,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"Oh, easy for you to say when you're not the one being targeted!",2024-09-03 22:28:09
8134,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,Targeted? You mean held accountable?,2024-09-03 22:29:09
8135,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_3,Enough! Let's divide the remaining work and try to salvage this.,2024-09-03 22:34:09
8136,escalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"Fine, but next time, I'm not teaming up with",2024-09-03 22:38:09
8137,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,I can't believe you ate my lunch from the fridge!,2024-09-03 21:07:13
8138,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,I thought it was up for grabs! Why didn't you label it?,2024-09-03 21:09:13
8139,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,Why should I have to label something that's obviously not yours?,2024-09-03 21:15:13
8140,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,"It's an office fridge, anyone can take anything. That's the whole point!",2024-09-03 21:25:13
8141,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_3,"Hey, keep it down, what's going on?",2024-09-03 21:31:13
8142,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,Andrew here thinks he can just take anyone's food without asking!,2024-09-03 21:36:13
8143,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,"Like I said, nothing was labeled. Don't make a big deal out of it.",2024-09-03 21:40:13
8144,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_3,"But that's not right, Andrew. Everyone knows to ask first.",2024-09-03 21:48:13
8145,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,"Are you seriously getting on my case for a sandwich? Grow up, both of you.",2024-09-03 21:50:13
8146,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,It's not just a sandwich! It's about respect. You can't go around acting like the whole world owes you.,2024-09-03 21:53:13
8147,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,"Respect? You’re overreacting. It's food in a communal space, don't be so childish.",2024-09-03 22:02:13
8148,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_3,"Look, Andrew, you messed up. Own it and apologize.",2024-09-03 22:03:13
8149,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,"Fine, I'm sorry. But really, it's just a sandwich.",2024-09-03 22:04:13
8150,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,"Just forget it. Next time, I’ll bring a padlock for the fridge!",2024-09-03 22:14:13
8151,escalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,Whatever. Maybe you should.,2024-09-03 22:17:13
8152,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you took the car last night?,2024-09-03 21:16:16
8153,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,"Because I knew you would freak out, like you're doing now!",2024-09-03 21:25:16
8154,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,"Of course I'm freaking out, it's my car and you didn't ask for permission!",2024-09-03 21:31:16
8155,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,I just needed it for a couple of hours; it's not like I crashed it or anything.,2024-09-03 21:34:16
8156,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,That's not the point! You can't just take things without asking.,2024-09-03 21:40:16
8157,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren’t so controlling, I'd actually feel comfortable asking.",2024-09-03 21:50:16
8158,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,Controlling? I'm just trying to set some basic rules. Is that too much to ask?,2024-09-03 21:56:16
8159,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,It is when your “rules” are suffocating. I needed some space.,2024-09-03 21:59:16
8160,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,"Space? You want space? How about you get your own car, then you can have all the space you want!",2024-09-03 22:09:16
8161,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,"Oh, that's rich. Easy for you to say when you don't have to worry about money.",2024-09-03 22:14:16
8162,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,Don't make this about money. It's about respect and boundaries.,2024-09-03 22:16:16
8163,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,Respect? Boundaries? Ha! You don't respect mine at all. Always checking up on me!,2024-09-03 22:18:16
8164,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,Because I care about you! How can you not see that?,2024-09-03 22:23:16
8165,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,"Maybe if you trusted me a little, instead of always doubting everything I do.",2024-09-03 22:28:16
8166,escalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,"Trust has to be earned, and you didn't",2024-09-03 22:35:16
8167,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't consult me before making that decision, Alex!",2024-09-03 21:09:20
8168,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,"Are you serious, Jamie? It's just a minor change to the project. You always overreact!",2024-09-03 21:19:20
8169,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,A minor change? You switched the entire presentation format! Do you know how much work you just dumped on me?,2024-09-03 21:23:20
8170,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. It's not like you can't handle it. You're always talking about how good you are at managing stuff.",2024-09-03 21:32:20
8171,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,"That's not the point! The point is respect and teamwork, something you clearly know nothing about!",2024-09-03 21:37:20
8172,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,Respect? You're the one constantly nitpicking and micromanaging every little thing I do. How's that for respect?,2024-09-03 21:44:20
8173,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,Maybe I wouldn't have to if you actually followed through on your responsibilities instead of cutting corners.,2024-09-03 21:53:20
8174,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,"Cutting corners? I work just as hard, if not harder than you! Just because I don't announce every single thing I do doesn't mean I'm slacking off!",2024-09-03 21:56:20
8175,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault for not being a mind reader? You could at least communicate your changes instead of blindsiding me.",2024-09-03 21:57:20
8176,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,I did communicate! You were just too busy criticizing my last idea to actually listen.,2024-09-03 22:07:20
8177,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,"That's a cop-out, and you know it. Accountability is part of teamwork, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:14:20
8178,escalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,Accountability? This is rich coming from you! You never admit when you're,2024-09-03 22:22:20
8179,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,Why did you send that email without consulting any of us first?,2024-09-03 21:14:23
8180,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,"Because someone had to make a decision, and you were all dragging your feet!",2024-09-03 21:23:23
8181,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,"That's not fair! We were waiting for your input, and you went behind our backs!",2024-09-03 21:31:23
8182,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_3,"Seriously, this isn't how teammates behave. We all have stakes in this project!",2024-09-03 21:35:23
8183,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break! All you do is talk and nothing ever gets done!",2024-09-03 21:42:23
8184,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_3,"That's not true, and you know it! We have a process, and you ignored it!",2024-09-03 21:52:23
8185,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,You should have at least asked for our opinions before making such a big move.,2024-09-03 21:57:23
8186,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,"Like your opinions matter? Last time I checked, I'm the lead on this project.",2024-09-03 22:02:23
8187,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_3,Being the lead doesn't give you the right to bulldoze everyone else's ideas.,2024-09-03 22:08:23
8188,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,"Exactly! Collaboration means involving everyone, not just doing whatever you want.",2024-09-03 22:13:23
8189,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,"Maybe if you all moved faster, I wouldn't have to take over in the first place!",2024-09-03 22:22:23
8190,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_3,So it's our fault now? You’re the one causing friction in the team!,2024-09-03 22:32:23
8191,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,This isn't constructive. We need to find a way to work together.,2024-09-03 22:33:23
8192,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,"Fine, but don't expect me to slow down just because you two can't keep up.",2024-09-03 22:36:23
8193,escalatory_conversation_554,speaker_3,We’re not asking you to slow down; we’re asking you,2024-09-03 22:38:23
8194,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,"Why did you take my design without asking, John?",2024-09-03 21:10:27
8195,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"I didn't take your design, Sarah. I was just inspired by it.",2024-09-03 21:14:27
8196,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,"""Inspired""? It looks exactly the same! That's not inspiration; that's stealing!",2024-09-03 21:19:27
8197,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"You're blowing this out of proportion. It's just a school project. Relax, it's not the end of the world.",2024-09-03 21:24:27
8198,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,That's easy for you to say when you didn't spend hours working on it.,2024-09-03 21:33:27
8199,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"Oh come on, I put in work too. You're acting like I did nothing at all.",2024-09-03 21:40:27
8200,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,Because you didn't! You just lifted my ideas and changed a few things. That's plagiarizing!,2024-09-03 21:50:27
8201,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"Seriously, you're acting like you're the only genius here. Other people can have good ideas too, you know.",2024-09-03 21:58:27
8202,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,Good ideas? You barely even understand the material we were learning!,2024-09-03 22:00:27
8203,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"And what, you think you’re some kind of expert? Acting all high and mighty just because you got an A last semester?",2024-09-03 22:06:27
8204,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,At least I earned my grade instead of copying someone else's work!,2024-09-03 22:15:27
8205,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,You're such a hypocrite. Remember last year when you borrowed my notes without asking and got credit for it?,2024-09-03 22:18:27
8206,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,That was different and you know it. I never claimed your work as my own!,2024-09-03 22:20:27
8207,escalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"Oh right, and putting your name on my notes isn't claiming",2024-09-03 22:25:27
8208,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,Why did you use my research without giving me any credit?,2024-09-03 21:08:30
8209,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Your research? I thought it was a group project!,2024-09-03 21:18:30
8210,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,"Yes, but I did the bulk of the data collection and analysis!",2024-09-03 21:25:30
8211,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Bulk? All you did was gather some stats. I did the entire write-up!,2024-09-03 21:31:30
8212,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,"Gathering stats is the hardest part! Without accurate data, your write-up means nothing!",2024-09-03 21:36:30
8213,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,"Really? Because without my write-up, those stats would just be numbers!",2024-09-03 21:39:30

8215,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Communicate? You never showed up to our planning meetings!,2024-09-03 21:47:30
8216,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,I was working my butt off to get those numbers while you sat around!,2024-09-03 21:49:30
8217,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Sat around? I had to double-check your numbers because there were so many errors!,2024-09-03 21:56:30
8218,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,That's a lie! My numbers were solid. You're just making excuses for taking all the credit!,2024-09-03 22:01:30
8219,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Making excuses? I'm the one who stayed up all night editing and formatting!,2024-09-03 22:03:30
8220,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,And I'm the one who consulted experts to make sure our data was accurate!,2024-09-03 22:07:30
8221,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Experts? You mean Google?,2024-09-03 22:09:30
8222,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,That's it! I'm talking to the professor about this. I've had enough!,2024-09-03 22:18:30
8223,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Fine! Let's see what they have to say about your so-called contributions then!,2024-09-03 22:23:30
8224,escalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,Don't underestimate how,2024-09-03 22:31:30

8226,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,"Seriously, Mom? I had homework to do!",2024-09-03 21:21:33
8227,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,Homework isn't an excuse every single time. This is the third time this week you've ignored your chores.,2024-09-03 21:31:33
8228,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,It's not like setting the table takes a lot of time. You could have done it yourself!,2024-09-03 21:36:33

8231,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,We all have things to do. Your father and I both work all day and we still manage to keep the house running.,2024-09-03 21:53:33
8232,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,You don't get it. School is more stressful than your jobs!,2024-09-03 21:56:33
8233,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,"That's a gross exaggeration, and you know it. You need to start pulling your weight around here.",2024-09-03 21:58:33
8234,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,Maybe I wouldn't be so stressed if you didn't constantly breathe down my neck about everything!,2024-09-03 22:04:33
8235,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,And maybe I wouldn't have to if you showed a little initiative for once!,2024-09-03 22:10:33

8239,escalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,Because you don't communicate it,2024-09-03 22:29:33
8240,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,Why did you use my research in your presentation without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:11:36
8241,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,It wasn't like I stole it. I thought we'd agreed on sharing everything for our project.,2024-09-03 21:19:36

8247,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,It's all part of our group work. Do we need to attach our names to every single detail?,2024-09-03 21:53:36
8248,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,"If you want to erase my contribution, then maybe I shouldn't contribute at all next time.",2024-09-03 22:01:36
8249,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I should have done everything myself. Less drama that way.",2024-09-03 22:09:36
8250,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,Maybe you should have! At least then you'd understand what it's like to put in real effort for once.,2024-09-03 22:16:36
8251,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,"Wow, real mature. Maybe we should just tell the professor this isn't working out.",2024-09-03 22:24:36
8252,escalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,Maybe we should. I'm done with being walked all over.,2024-09-03 22:27:36
8253,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,I can't believe you took my idea and presented it as your own in the meeting.,2024-09-03 21:10:39
8254,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I didn't take your idea. We both discussed it.,2024-09-03 21:19:39
8255,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,Discussed it? More like I came up with it and you stole it.,2024-09-03 21:23:39
8256,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,Stop being so dramatic. I added to the idea and made it better.,2024-09-03 21:28:39
8257,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,Added to it? You didn't even mention my name!,2024-09-03 21:29:39
8258,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's about credit? Maybe if you spoke up more, people would recognize your contributions.",2024-09-03 21:33:39
8259,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,This is exactly why I never share my thoughts with you. You always overshadow me.,2024-09-03 21:40:39
8260,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"Overshadow you? Maybe if you weren't so insecure, you'd see that we need to work as a team.",2024-09-03 21:49:39
8261,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,Team? This feels more like a competition with you always trying to outdo me.,2024-09-03 21:50:39
8262,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,You're the one making it a competition. I'm just trying to get us ahead.,2024-09-03 21:56:39
8263,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,Us ahead or just you ahead? There's a big difference.,2024-09-03 22:00:39
8264,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"Oh, give me a break. You can't expect to get anywhere if you keep sulking about recognition.",2024-09-03 22:01:39
8265,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,"Maybe if you respected my input, I wouldn't need to sulk.",2024-09-03 22:07:39
8266,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"Respect? I respect ambition, not whining.",2024-09-03 22:17:39
8267,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,"And I respect integrity, which you clearly lack.",2024-09-03 22:27:39
8268,escalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,Fine,2024-09-03 22:28:39
8269,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the deadline change for the group project?,2024-09-03 21:09:42
8270,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,I thought you already knew. Everyone else seemed aware.,2024-09-03 21:14:42
8271,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"Obviously, I didn't know, or I wouldn't have asked!",2024-09-03 21:15:42
8272,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you checked your emails more often, you wouldn't miss important updates.",2024-09-03 21:24:42
8273,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"I do check my emails! Maybe if you communicated better, this wouldn't be an issue.",2024-09-03 21:31:42
8274,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Typical. You're always looking for someone else to blame.",2024-09-03 21:39:42
8275,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"I'm not blaming anyone, I'm just saying we need better coordination.",2024-09-03 21:49:42
8276,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,Coordination? Please. You're the one who never shows up to meetings.,2024-09-03 21:55:42
8277,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"I have a job, remember? Some of us have responsibilities outside of school.",2024-09-03 22:00:42
8278,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,And some of us are trying to juggle everything already. You're not the only one with commitments!,2024-09-03 22:08:42
8279,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"Fine, but that doesn't excuse leaving me out of the loop.",2024-09-03 22:10:42
8280,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more proactive, you wouldn't be left out!",2024-09-03 22:18:42
8281,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,Proactive? I'm doing my part; it's not my fault if others can't get their act together.,2024-09-03 22:24:42
8282,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,Your part? All you've done is complain! When was the last time you actually contributed?,2024-09-03 22:27:42
8283,escalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"You know what, this isn't worth it. This project is a disaster thanks to your lack of communication.",2024-09-03 22:31:42
8284,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the project without my final review.,2024-09-03 21:15:45
8285,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"You were taking too long to get back to me, and we were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:19:45
8286,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,That doesn't give you the right to just finalize everything on your own.,2024-09-03 21:29:45
8287,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to take charge! You were dragging your feet, as always.",2024-09-03 21:30:45
8288,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,"How dare you call me slow? I actually care about the quality of our work, unlike you.",2024-09-03 21:31:45
8289,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm the lazy one? At least I'm not obsessing over every tiny detail.",2024-09-03 21:39:45
8290,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,"Paying attention to details is what keeps us from making mistakes, genius.",2024-09-03 21:44:45
8291,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"Except your precious ""details"" always make us miss deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:46:45
8292,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,"And rushing things always makes us look unprofessional. Nice job on that typo in the third paragraph, by the way.",2024-09-03 21:56:45
8293,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,At least I got it done. Nobody's going to care about a single typo except you.,2024-09-03 22:05:45
8294,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,It's not just a typo! It changes the entire meaning of our analysis.,2024-09-03 22:10:45
8295,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,You're exaggerating. No one's going to notice or care.,2024-09-03 22:15:45
8296,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,"Maybe if you actually read things carefully, you'd understand why it matters.",2024-09-03 22:17:45
8297,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, we'd work better as a team.",2024-09-03 22:19:45
8298,escalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,Control freak? I'm the one who keeps this,2024-09-03 22:26:45
8299,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and changed the project plan without telling me!,2024-09-03 21:15:49
8300,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. You weren't even around to talk it over. Someone had to make a decision.",2024-09-03 21:17:49
8301,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,That's not an excuse! You know how important this project is to me.,2024-09-03 21:21:49
8302,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,And it's not important to me? You're acting like this is all about you.,2024-09-03 21:27:49
8303,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,Because you made it all about you by not including me in the decision!,2024-09-03 21:28:49
8304,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,I included you by taking into consideration what you've said before. You're just upset because it wasn't your exact idea!,2024-09-03 21:36:49
8305,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,"My exact idea was based on weeks of research, which you completely disregarded!",2024-09-03 21:37:49
8306,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,Disregarded? I adapted it to be more practical for our deadline. Not everything can be perfect!,2024-09-03 21:47:49
8307,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,Perfect? You call a half-baked plan practical? This isn't even executable!,2024-09-03 21:54:49
8308,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,Maybe it's not executable because you never want to compromise!,2024-09-03 21:59:49
8309,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,Compromising doesn't mean completely overruling my input!,2024-09-03 22:07:49
8310,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you'd actually been available to discuss it instead of being MIA, this wouldn't have happened.",2024-09-03 22:12:49
8311,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,I have other responsibilities too! That doesn't mean you get to override decisions we should make together.,2024-09-03 22:18:49
8312,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,"Fine, next time I'll wait for you and we can miss the deadline together then!",2024-09-03 22:19:49
8313,escalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,That's,2024-09-03 22:25:49
8314,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,Why did you change the project presentation without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:15:52
8315,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,I had to make sure it was polished before the deadline.,2024-09-03 21:20:52
8316,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,But we agreed on those slides! You can't just do whatever you want.,2024-09-03 21:22:52
8317,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you'd been more proactive, I wouldn't have had to.",2024-09-03 21:30:52
8318,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,"How dare you! I was the one who wrote all the content, and you know it!",2024-09-03 21:38:52
8319,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,And I was the one who had to fix all your errors!,2024-09-03 21:45:52
8320,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,Fix? You just messed everything up and made it worse with your changes!,2024-09-03 21:54:52
8321,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,At least I didn't waste time on irrelevant information!,2024-09-03 21:56:52
8322,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,Irrelevant? That data was crucial to our argument.,2024-09-03 22:06:52
8323,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,"No, it was just fluff. We needed to be concise.",2024-09-03 22:12:52
8324,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,You can't decide that alone. We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 22:14:52
8325,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,"Maybe if we had better communication, this wouldn't be such a mess.",2024-09-03 22:19:52
8326,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault we have communication issues?",2024-09-03 22:22:52
8327,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,I'm just saying you could be more open to collaboration.,2024-09-03 22:30:52
8328,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,Collaboration? You mean doing everything your way?,2024-09-03 22:38:52
8329,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,At least my way gets results!,2024-09-03 22:39:52
8330,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,Results? This mess of a presentation isn't going to impress anyone!,2024-09-03 22:48:52
8331,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,It's still better than what you had.,2024-09-03 22:57:52
8332,escalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,Unbel,2024-09-03 22:59:52
8333,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,I can't believe you took my design and presented it as your own.,2024-09-03 21:08:55
8334,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,What are you even talking about? I just used the concept we discussed in the meeting.,2024-09-03 21:11:55
8335,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,Concept? You copied the whole layout and color scheme!,2024-09-03 21:21:55
8336,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_3,"Guys, can we calm down and sort this out?",2024-09-03 21:24:55
8337,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,"No, this needs to be addressed. How dare you accuse me of stealing?",2024-09-03 21:34:55
8338,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,"Because you did! It was my work, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:40:55
8339,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,I contributed just as much as you did. You’re acting like I did nothing.,2024-09-03 21:48:55
8340,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,Contributed? You didn't even touch the initial drafts!,2024-09-03 21:58:55
8341,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_3,Can we just divide the tasks more clearly next time so this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 21:59:55
8342,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,"No, it’s not about dividing tasks; it's about getting credit that I deserve.",2024-09-03 22:09:55
8343,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,Credit you deserve? Unbelievable! You waltzed in at the last minute!,2024-09-03 22:14:55
8344,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,And yet my input drastically improved the final product.,2024-09-03 22:18:55
8345,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_3,"You both did great work, but this shouting isn't solving anything.",2024-09-03 22:25:55
8346,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,It's easy for you to say when you're not the one being ripped off.,2024-09-03 22:32:55
8347,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,"Being ripped off? Stop exaggerating. If anything, I enhanced your mediocre draft.",2024-09-03 22:37:55
8348,escalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,Mediocre? You’ve got some nerve. Maybe I should talk to the boss about,2024-09-03 22:38:55
8349,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,"Why did you borrow my laptop without asking, again?",2024-09-03 21:15:59
8350,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,"Because I needed it for my project, okay?",2024-09-03 21:21:59
8351,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,"You always ""need"" it but never tell me first.",2024-09-03 21:24:59
8352,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,It's not like you're doing anything important on it.,2024-09-03 21:27:59
8353,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,That’s not for you to decide! What if I had something crucial saved?,2024-09-03 21:29:59
8354,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,Then maybe you should save it somewhere better.,2024-09-03 21:34:59
8355,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,"It's my laptop, my rules. Respect that!",2024-09-03 21:36:59
8356,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,You act like you’re the only one with important stuff to do!,2024-09-03 21:37:59
8357,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,"I value my work, and I need my tools. You're being inconsiderate.",2024-09-03 21:42:59
8358,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,"Oh, I’m inconsiderate? You never let me use anything.",2024-09-03 21:47:59
8359,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,"Because every time I do, you mess stuff up!",2024-09-03 21:50:59
8360,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,That’s not true! You just assume the worst of me.,2024-09-03 21:55:59
8361,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,"Maybe if you asked nicely and returned things without damage, I wouldn’t have to.",2024-09-03 21:59:59
8362,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,"Fine, next time, I'll just fail my project because I'm scared of your overreactions.",2024-09-03 22:00:59
8363,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,Or maybe find a way to share and respect each other's belongings?,2024-09-03 22:09:59
8364,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,Share? You’re one to talk about sharing.,2024-09-03 22:17:59
8365,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,What’s that supposed to mean?,2024-09-03 22:26:59
8366,escalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,You never shared your stuff growing up either.,2024-09-03 22:33:59
8367,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,You seriously lost my laptop? How can you be so careless?,2024-09-03 21:10:02
8368,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,It's not like I did it on purpose! It was an accident.,2024-09-03 21:13:02
8369,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,An accident? You left it on the bus! That's beyond careless.,2024-09-03 21:20:02
8370,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"Oh, and you've never made a mistake before? Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:30:02
8371,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,Not one that cost someone else their property!,2024-09-03 21:32:02
8372,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't always leave your stuff lying around, it wouldn't get lost!",2024-09-03 21:40:02
8373,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,Don't try to blame this on me. You were the one who borrowed it.,2024-09-03 21:45:02
8374,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"Borrowed it because you asked me to drop it off! So technically, it's your fault.",2024-09-03 21:54:02
8375,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,That's ridiculous. How is that my fault?,2024-09-03 22:00:02
8376,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"Because if you hadn't asked me, I wouldn't have taken it in the first place!",2024-09-03 22:10:02
8377,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,So now it's wrong to ask for a favor? Unbelievable.,2024-09-03 22:12:02
8378,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"Seriously, you need to chill out. We can try to get it back!",2024-09-03 22:14:02
8379,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,And how exactly do you plan to do that? It's gone!,2024-09-03 22:15:02
8380,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,I can contact the bus company and see if anyone turned it in.,2024-09-03 22:23:02
8381,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,"Oh, like that ever works. Might as well say goodbye to it now.",2024-09-03 22:32:02
8382,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,Thanks for the vote of confidence. Really helps a lot.,2024-09-03 22:35:02
8383,escalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,"Well, maybe if",2024-09-03 22:36:02
8384,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,"You always think you know better, but you know what? Your strategies for the project sucked!",2024-09-03 21:08:06
8385,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,Oh really? At least I wasn't the one slacking off and missing deadlines.,2024-09-03 21:12:06
8386,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,I missed one deadline. One! And it's not like you ever helped me catch up.,2024-09-03 21:14:06
8387,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,Maybe I would have if you actually communicated instead of going off and doing your own thing.,2024-09-03 21:19:06
8388,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,It's hard to communicate when you're constantly belittling my ideas!,2024-09-03 21:27:06
8389,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,I belittled your ideas because they were unworkable and would have wasted more time.,2024-09-03 21:28:06
8390,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,And yours were so perfect? Tell that to the first round of feedback we got—they hated everything you suggested.,2024-09-03 21:37:06
8391,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,They hated it because you didn't implement it correctly! How many times did I have to explain it to you?,2024-09-03 21:47:06
8392,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,You never explained anything! You just assumed I would read your mind. That's not teamwork.,2024-09-03 21:49:06
8393,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,Teamwork? You're the one who decided to change directions without even consulting me first. How is that teamwork?,2024-09-03 21:59:06
8394,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,Because your directions were getting us nowhere! Someone had to step up and try something different.,2024-09-03 22:06:06
8395,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,So your idea of stepping up is disregarding everything we've planned and making a mess?,2024-09-03 22:09:06
8396,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,"If you had just been open to my suggestions, maybe it wouldn't have turned into such a mess!",2024-09-03 22:17:06
8397,escalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,Open?,2024-09-03 22:26:06
8398,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't finish your part of the project, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:12:09
8399,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,"I was busy, Jenna. I have other classes, you know.",2024-09-03 21:14:09
8400,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,We all have other classes. That's not an excuse for letting the whole group down.,2024-09-03 21:21:09
8401,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_3,"Yeah, seriously, it's like you don't even care about our grade.",2024-09-03 21:25:09
8402,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! You guys are overreacting. It's just one assignment.",2024-09-03 21:26:09
8403,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,One assignment that counts for 20% of our final grade!,2024-09-03 21:35:09
8404,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_3,"Maybe if you'd been at the last two meetings, you'd understand how crucial it was.",2024-09-03 21:42:09
8405,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,Meetings? I wasn't even informed about those. You can't blame me for something I didn't know about.,2024-09-03 21:51:09
8406,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,"Oh, we informed you alright! Check your messages.",2024-09-03 21:54:09
8407,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,So now it's my fault for missing messages? Great.,2024-09-03 21:58:09
8408,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_3,This isn't the first time either. You're always slacking off and expecting us to pick up the pieces.,2024-09-03 22:02:09
8409,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,That's not true. I've done my fair share in the past.,2024-09-03 22:07:09
8410,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,"Well, it doesn't feel like it. We had to redo half of what you submitted last time too.",2024-09-03 22:14:09
8411,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,"If you think my work is so bad, why don't you just kick me out of the group?",2024-09-03 22:20:09
8412,escalatory_conversation_568,speaker_3,Maybe we should! At least we wouldn't have to worry about covering for you all the,2024-09-03 22:21:09
8413,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,Why am I finding out now that the rent check bounced?,2024-09-03 21:17:12
8414,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,I told you we needed to keep better track of our expenses! You never listen!,2024-09-03 21:20:12
8415,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,Don't put this all on me! You’ve been spending without thinking too!,2024-09-03 21:24:12
8416,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,Because I'm always the one buying groceries and paying for utilities! What's your excuse?,2024-09-03 21:29:12
8417,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,My excuse? I'm the one who's been working overtime to try and keep us afloat!,2024-09-03 21:30:12
8418,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,"And yet somehow, we’re still struggling. Maybe your overtime isn't enough!",2024-09-03 21:39:12
8419,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,Are you serious? Do you even know how exhausting it is?,2024-09-03 21:49:12
8420,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,Do you think I'm lounging around doing nothing? Keeping this place running is a full-time job!,2024-09-03 21:56:12
8421,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,"Oh, so you're saying my job isn’t as hard as yours?",2024-09-03 22:00:12
8422,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,Don’t twist my words! I'm saying you need to be more responsible financially.,2024-09-03 22:04:12
8423,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,You don't get it. I can't fix our finances alone.,2024-09-03 22:14:12
8424,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,"Then maybe we need to cut down on unnecessary spending, like your impulsive online purchases!",2024-09-03 22:24:12
8425,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,My online purchases? What about your expensive take-out dinners?,2024-09-03 22:29:12
8426,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,We need to eat! And take-out is because I'm too tired from all the cleaning and errands!,2024-09-03 22:31:12
8427,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,"Maybe if you planned meals better, we wouldn't need as much take-out!",2024-09-03 22:32:12
8428,escalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,So now it's my fault,2024-09-03 22:39:12
8429,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,Why did you touch my project without asking?,2024-09-03 21:17:17
8430,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"I didn't think it would be a big deal, we share space in the studio.",2024-09-03 21:18:17
8431,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"It's not about the space, it's about you messing up my work!",2024-09-03 21:26:17
8432,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,I was just trying to help you improve it; it looked like it needed some tweaks.,2024-09-03 21:27:17
8433,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,Improve it? You ruined it. Do you even know how much time I spent on that?,2024-09-03 21:36:17
8434,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"Oh, come on. You're overreacting. It didn't take that long to make those changes.",2024-09-03 21:37:17
8435,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,You don't get to decide what's an overreaction. It's my project!,2024-09-03 21:44:17
8436,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"Well maybe if you weren't so touchy about everything, this wouldn't be an issue.",2024-09-03 21:50:17
8437,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,Touchy? You're the one who's always sticking your nose where it doesn't belong!,2024-09-03 21:56:17
8438,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"Maybe because you never listen to my suggestions, I thought this time you'd see they were good.",2024-09-03 21:58:17
8439,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"I don't need your unsolicited advice, especially when it's ruining my work!",2024-09-03 22:07:17
8440,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"Fine, next time I'll let you make mistakes and fail on your own then.",2024-09-03 22:17:17
8441,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"I'd rather fail on my own than have you ""help"" and ruin everything.",2024-09-03 22:24:17
8442,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"You know what, you can keep your precious project. I'm done trying to be a good studio mate.",2024-09-03 22:25:17
8443,escalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"Good, because I don't need someone like you making",2024-09-03 22:35:17
8444,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for rehearsal again, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:12:20
8445,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"I told you, I had other plans. This band isn't my entire life, you know.",2024-09-03 21:15:20
8446,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,"We have a gig in two days, and you just don't seem to care!",2024-09-03 21:16:20
8447,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't such a control freak, I'd be more interested in practicing.",2024-09-03 21:23:20
8448,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,"Maybe if you actually committed to something for once, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:26:20
8449,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's all my fault? Like you haven't done anything wrong ever?",2024-09-03 21:36:20
8450,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,I'm the only one actually putting in any effort here!,2024-09-03 21:42:20
8451,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,You know what? Maybe I should just quit. Would that make you happy?,2024-09-03 21:44:20
8452,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,Go ahead. Quit. It’s not like you're contributing anything anyway!,2024-09-03 21:46:20
8453,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"Fine, I will! Good luck finding someone to replace me on such short notice.",2024-09-03 21:50:20
8454,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,I don't need you to find someone better. Anyone would be better at this point.,2024-09-03 22:00:20
8455,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,You're going to regret this when the show bombs without me.,2024-09-03 22:02:20
8456,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,I'd rather take that risk than deal with your lousy attitude any longer.,2024-09-03 22:11:20
8457,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"Good luck, because you'll need it. Don't call me when it all falls apart.",2024-09-03 22:12:20
8458,escalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,Don’t worry. I won’t.,2024-09-03 22:21:20
8459,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,"Why did you take credit for my idea in the meeting, Nathan?",2024-09-03 21:16:24
8460,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Jake? I didn't take credit for anything.",2024-09-03 21:26:24
8461,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,"Don't play dumb. The marketing strategy you presented was mine, and you know it.",2024-09-03 21:29:24
8462,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,"Oh, right, because you just own the concept of ""targeted ads."" Give me a break.",2024-09-03 21:31:24
8463,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,"No, but the specific approach was mine, and you didn't even mention my name!",2024-09-03 21:36:24
8464,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,"Maybe if you spoke up more, people would actually know you contribute.",2024-09-03 21:40:24
8465,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who never lets others get a word in edgewise.,2024-09-03 21:44:24
8466,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,"Look, if you can’t handle the competitive environment, maybe this job isn’t for you.",2024-09-03 21:47:24
8467,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,Don’t turn this around on me. You’ve always been a glory hog since day one.,2024-09-03 21:52:24
8468,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,And you’ve always been a whiner. Maybe that’s why no one respects you here.,2024-09-03 22:02:24
8469,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,"How dare you! I’ve put in just as much work as you have, if not more.",2024-09-03 22:10:24
8470,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,"Well, clearly not enough if you need to go around accusing people of stealing your ideas.",2024-09-03 22:17:24
8471,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,You know what? This isn’t over. I’m taking this to HR.,2024-09-03 22:22:24
8472,escalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,Fine by me. Maybe they'll teach you how to be a team player.,2024-09-03 22:26:24
8473,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,"I can't believe you did that, Sam! How could you let the whole project fall apart?",2024-09-03 21:15:28
8474,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again, blaming everything on me. Maybe if you had done your part on time, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:16:28
8475,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,"My part? I sent you my sections days ago, and they were perfectly fine. You were supposed to combine everything and finalize it!",2024-09-03 21:23:28
8476,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,"Yeah, well maybe if you had written something useful, combining wouldn't have taken forever. It's not my fault you can't write a decent paragraph!",2024-09-03 21:25:28
8477,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,"Excuse me? I put a lot of effort into my sections, way more than you ever did! You were slacking off the whole time!",2024-09-03 21:35:28
8478,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,"That’s a lie! I’ve been working non-stop to clean up everyone else's mess, including yours. Maybe if you paid attention instead of having your head in the clouds, we'd be done by now!",2024-09-03 21:43:28
8479,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,Head in the clouds? I'm the only one who's been taking this project seriously. Your lack of focus is the real issue here!,2024-09-03 21:47:28
8480,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,"Lack of focus? You're joking, right? Maybe you should look in the mirror and fix your own mistakes before pointing fingers at others.",2024-09-03 21:54:28
8481,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,"Oh, I’ve looked, and I see someone who's been trying to hold this group together. Unlike you, who seems to enjoy watching it crumble!",2024-09-03 22:03:28
8482,escalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,That’s rich,2024-09-03 22:09:28
8483,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't follow the plan, John. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:16:31
8484,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Lisa, but the plan was flawed from the beginning. I had to make a call on the spot.",2024-09-03 21:26:31
8485,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,Flawed? We've been working on it for weeks! You just completely disregarded all our hard work.,2024-09-03 21:33:31
8486,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,"Disregarded? No, I made an adjustment because I saw a better way to achieve the goal.",2024-09-03 21:42:31
8487,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_3,"Wait, what happened exactly? Did someone go off-script during the presentation?",2024-09-03 21:50:31
8488,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,"Yes, John here decided to improvise and it completely threw everyone off.",2024-09-03 21:54:31
8489,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,"Improvised? It was a minor change, not some huge deviation. You're blowing this out of proportion.",2024-09-03 21:56:31
8490,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_4,"Guys, can't we just take a step back and discuss this rationally?",2024-09-03 22:04:31
8491,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,Rationally? He sabotaged the project in front of our biggest client!,2024-09-03 22:07:31
8492,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,Sabotaged? Are you serious? I saved us from embarrassment when the client asked that unexpected question.,2024-09-03 22:15:31
8493,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_3,"John, I appreciate quick thinking, but why didn't you communicate the change to us beforehand?",2024-09-03 22:21:31
8494,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,There wasn't any time! I had to act fast or we'd look incompetent.,2024-09-03 22:25:31
8495,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_4,Can we at least agree that in the future we need a backup plan to handle such situations?,2024-09-03 22:31:31
8496,escalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,If he didn’t trust the plan,2024-09-03 22:40:31
8497,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,"You never take anything seriously, Alicia. We should have focused on our presentation for class instead of goofing off.",2024-09-03 21:16:34
8498,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,"Oh really, Jake? And what about you constantly getting distracted by your phone?",2024-09-03 21:26:34
8499,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,At least I get my parts done on time. What's your excuse for missing the deadline?,2024-09-03 21:32:34
8500,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,"My excuse? Maybe if you actually communicated instead of blaming me for everything, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:36:34
8501,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,Communicate? I tried. You just ignored my messages and went out with your friends!,2024-09-03 21:46:34
8502,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,"I needed a break. It's not healthy to work non-stop like you. Plus, you’re not exactly a team player yourself.",2024-09-03 21:49:34
8503,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,"Well, teamwork means sometimes making sacrifices. Not ditching our work for fun.",2024-09-03 21:56:34
8504,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,Sacrifices? I've sacrificed more social time than you ever have just to keep up with your unrealistic expectations!,2024-09-03 22:05:34
8505,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,My expectations are unrealistic? You're the one who thought we could finish an entire project in half the time!,2024-09-03 22:12:34
8506,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,Only because you wasted the other half complaining and micromanaging every little thing!,2024-09-03 22:21:34
8507,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,Someone had to make sure things were done right. You clearly couldn't be trusted to do it.,2024-09-03 22:30:34
8508,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I'm not trustworthy? That's rich coming from the guy who can't go five minutes without checking Instagram.",2024-09-03 22:31:34
8509,escalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,At least I use my phone,2024-09-03 22:35:34
8510,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,"Danny, you never show up to band practice on time! We're falling behind because of you.",2024-09-03 21:14:40
8511,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,"Oh please, Sarah, like you're never late. The last time you were the one who skipped a practice.",2024-09-03 21:19:40
8512,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,That was one time! You're late every week. We can't keep up if our drummer isn't here!,2024-09-03 21:20:40
8513,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,"Maybe I wouldn't be late if you actually bothered to help haul the equipment for once, instead of just standing around.",2024-09-03 21:24:40
8514,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_3,"Guys, can we just focus on the performance? We've got a gig coming up and this isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:26:40
8515,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,"The performance is exactly why I'm upset, Jacob. We're not ready, and Danny's making it worse!",2024-09-03 21:33:40
8516,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,Don't you put this all on me! You know Mark hasn't even learned the new song yet.,2024-09-03 21:40:40
8517,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_3,"Wait, don't drag me into this. I'm struggling because we don't practice enough thanks to your lateness, Danny.",2024-09-03 21:43:40
8518,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,See? Even Mark agrees. You need to get your act together or we won't have a band left.,2024-09-03 21:48:40
8519,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,"If you all think it's just my fault, why don't you try drumming? Let's see how well you do.",2024-09-03 21:58:40
8520,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,"That's not the point! We each have our roles, and you're not fulfilling yours!",2024-09-03 22:08:40
8521,escalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,"Oh, and you are? Maybe if you led better as the vocalist, we'd have more motivation.",2024-09-03 22:18:40
8522,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball in the last quarter? We could've won the game!,2024-09-03 21:17:43
8523,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,Are you serious right now? I didn't pass because you kept missing all your shots earlier!,2024-09-03 21:21:43
8524,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"That's not fair! At least I was trying, unlike you just hogging the ball!",2024-09-03 21:30:43
8525,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,Hogging? I was making plays while you were fumbling around like a rookie!,2024-09-03 21:35:43
8526,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_3,"Guys, can we not tear each other apart? It's just one game.",2024-09-03 21:37:43
8527,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"Stay out of this, speaker_3! We lost because speaker_2 wouldn't trust his own team!",2024-09-03 21:43:43
8528,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,"And we lost because you couldn't handle the pressure! Every time I looked, you were screwing up!",2024-09-03 21:53:43
8529,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it’s all on me? What about your turnovers, huh?",2024-09-03 21:55:43
8530,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,"At least I was doing something! You just stood there, waiting for someone to hand you a miracle!",2024-09-03 22:03:43
8531,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_3,Arguing isn't going to change the outcome. Let's focus on what we can improve for the next game.,2024-09-03 22:11:43
8532,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"Improve? How about improving on not being a ball hog, speaker_2?",2024-09-03 22:13:43
8533,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,And maybe you should improve on actually making a shot before you talk!,2024-09-03 22:16:43
8534,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_4,Both of you need to chill out. You're acting like kids.,2024-09-03 22:21:43
8535,escalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"This isn't about chilling out, speaker_4! It's about",2024-09-03 22:23:43
8536,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the presentation, Jake. We were counting on you!",2024-09-03 21:13:46
8537,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,"Oh come on, Sarah. It wasn't that big of a deal. You guys did fine without me.",2024-09-03 21:22:46
8538,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,Not that big of a deal? Are you kidding me? We needed your part to make a complete argument.,2024-09-03 21:26:46
8539,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_3,"Yeah, Jake. You let the whole team down. We got grilled by the client and you were nowhere to be found.",2024-09-03 21:35:46
8540,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,"Maybe if you guys were more organized, I wouldn't have felt the need to skip.",2024-09-03 21:39:46
8541,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,More organized? You've missed half the meetings! How are we supposed to plan around you?,2024-09-03 21:42:46
8542,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,It's not my fault I have other responsibilities. Maybe if you actually listened to my schedule once in a while.,2024-09-03 21:49:46
8543,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_3,"We did listen, Jake. We moved the meeting times to accommodate you, and you still bailed!",2024-09-03 21:53:46
8544,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,"Well, maybe it's because I don't think this project is worth my time.",2024-09-03 21:56:46
8545,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,"If that's how you feel, then why are you even bothering to stay on the team? We need people who are committed.",2024-09-03 22:04:46
8546,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_3,"Seriously, just admit you messed up and stop making excuses.",2024-09-03 22:06:46
8547,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,Admit I messed up? You guys are always excluding me from key decisions anyway.,2024-09-03 22:08:46
8548,escalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,Excluding you? You miss the meetings and then complain about not being in,2024-09-03 22:14:46
8549,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the group project without even consulting us!,2024-09-03 21:08:53
8550,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! We all agreed on the content days ago. What's the big deal?",2024-09-03 21:09:53
8551,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,The big deal? You left out my entire section on market analysis!,2024-09-03 21:15:53
8552,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_3,"Yeah, and my part on financial projections was barely touched. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:18:53
8553,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,Seriously? I had to make executive decisions because you all were dragging your feet and we were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:25:53
8554,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_3,Executive decisions? This isn't a dictatorship! We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 21:26:53
8555,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,Exactly! How are we supposed to get a good grade if you just ignore half of the work?,2024-09-03 21:34:53
8556,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,"Maybe if you guys turned in your sections earlier, I wouldn't have had to make those cuts.",2024-09-03 21:43:53
8557,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_3,Turning them in earlier wouldn't have mattered if you were just going to do whatever you wanted anyway.,2024-09-03 21:48:53
8558,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,We need to sit down with the professor and explain what happened. This isn't fair!,2024-09-03 21:49:53
8559,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,"Go ahead, but don't be surprised if the professor sides with me. I was the one who made sure we had something to submit on time.",2024-09-03 21:54:53
8560,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_3,"You may have submitted it on time, but it's a mess without our contributions. This could ruin our grade.",2024-09-03 21:59:53
8561,escalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,And it's not just about the grade; it's about respect and teamwork. This is not how we should be,2024-09-03 22:03:53
8562,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,You can't seriously be thinking about replacing Johnson with Mark on the project team!,2024-09-03 21:10:56
8563,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,"Oh, I am, and I have good reasons for it. Johnson has been slacking off for weeks!",2024-09-03 21:20:56
8564,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_3,Are you kidding me? Johnson knows the entire system inside out. Mark barely understands half of it!,2024-09-03 21:30:56
8565,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,Johnson's been with us for years. Replacing him now is just unfair!,2024-09-03 21:34:56
8566,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,It's not about fairness; it's about results. Johnson's performance has plummeted!,2024-09-03 21:41:56
8567,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_3,"Maybe if you actually took the time to see the workload he's been carrying, you'd reconsider your stance!",2024-09-03 21:44:56
8568,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,Exactly. We all know he's been overloaded since the new contract came in.,2024-09-03 21:47:56
8569,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,"Overloaded or not, if he can't deliver, we need someone who can. End of story.",2024-09-03 21:53:56
8570,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_3,End of story? You’re talking about a key team member as if he’s disposable!,2024-09-03 22:02:56
8571,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,This isn't just about work; it's about loyalty and recognizing people's limits.,2024-09-03 22:06:56
8572,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,And what about loyalty to the project? To the rest of us who have to pick up his slack?,2024-09-03 22:15:56
8573,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_3,Loyalty goes both ways. We can't just toss out someone who’s given so much.,2024-09-03 22:20:56
8574,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,"Maybe Mark is a hard worker, but he doesn't have the experience. How does that help us in the long run?",2024-09-03 22:30:56
8575,escalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,Experience isn't the only thing,2024-09-03 22:39:56
8576,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without consulting any of us.,2024-09-03 21:17:59
8577,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"Oh, so now it's my fault? At least I got something done instead of waiting around!",2024-09-03 21:27:59
8578,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,Something done? You completely ignored the crucial parts we discussed!,2024-09-03 21:32:59
8579,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_3,"Guys, calm down. We need to talk about this rationally.",2024-09-03 21:34:59
8580,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,Rationally? There’s nothing rational about being ganged up on for taking initiative!,2024-09-03 21:39:59
8581,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,Initiative? More like taking over and ruining our chances at a good grade.,2024-09-03 21:42:59
8582,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_4,I agree with speaker_1. You didn’t even put the correct data in the presentation.,2024-09-03 21:52:59
8583,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if someone else had taken the lead, things wouldn’t have been left to the last minute!",2024-09-03 21:55:59
8584,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_3,We all had roles assigned. You weren’t supposed to do everything yourself.,2024-09-03 22:02:59
8585,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"Roles? Come on, you all know no one was following through. I did what had to be done.",2024-09-03 22:11:59
8586,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,What had to be done? You mean jeopardizing our entire semester’s effort?,2024-09-03 22:20:59
8587,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_4,"And now we have to explain this mess to the professor, thanks to you.",2024-09-03 22:22:59
8588,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"Fine, go ahead and blame me. But don't expect me to clean up after you ever again.",2024-09-03 22:24:59
8589,escalatory_conversation_581,speaker_3,This is getting us nowhere. Arguing now isn't going to solve anything. We need to figure,2024-09-03 22:33:59
8590,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead with the launch without consulting any of us!,2024-09-03 21:10:02
8591,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,Are you serious? We agreed on this timeline weeks ago.,2024-09-03 21:13:02
8592,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,"No, we didn't! We agreed to discuss any major decisions, not just rush into them.",2024-09-03 21:22:02
8593,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to make a decision, or we'd be stuck in endless debates.",2024-09-03 21:25:02
8594,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,"Hold on. Both of you need to calm down. We're a team, remember?",2024-09-03 21:33:02
8595,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,Easy for you to say. You weren't the one blindsided by this.,2024-09-03 21:42:02
8596,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! If we waited for everyone, we'd never get anything done.",2024-09-03 21:48:02
8597,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,This is exactly the problem. We don't communicate and then blame each other when things go wrong.,2024-09-03 21:57:02
8598,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,Communication? When was the last time we had a proper meeting?,2024-09-03 22:02:02
8599,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,Maybe because our meetings are usually pointless and go nowhere.,2024-09-03 22:09:02
8600,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,"Both of you, stop. We need to figure out how to fix this, not tear each other apart.",2024-09-03 22:16:02
8601,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,Fix it? We're already dealing with fallout from customers who weren't informed.,2024-09-03 22:18:02
8602,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,And you think delaying would have made them any happier?,2024-09-03 22:27:02
8603,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,This back-and-forth is getting us nowhere. Can we focus on a solution?,2024-09-03 22:30:02
8604,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,"Fine. But we need to establish better communication, starting now.",2024-09-03 22:35:02
8605,escalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,Agreed. But,2024-09-03 22:42:02
8606,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,"I can't believe you told the coach about my injury, Sam. Do you even know what you've done?",2024-09-03 21:18:06
8607,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,"Jess, I did it because it was the right thing to do. You couldn't play with that sprained ankle!",2024-09-03 21:24:06
8608,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,It's none of your business! I was willing to push through for the championship!,2024-09-03 21:33:06
8609,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,"And risk permanent damage? For what, a game? You're being reckless.",2024-09-03 21:42:06
8610,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,Reckless? You just ruined my chances of leading the team. Everyone's going to think I'm weak now!,2024-09-03 21:48:06
8611,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,They won't think you're weak. They'll see that you care more about your health and the future.,2024-09-03 21:52:06
8612,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,Future? What future? The scouts were here! This was my one shot!,2024-09-03 21:56:06
8613,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,And what about the next game or next season? You need to be able to play at your best.,2024-09-03 21:57:06
8614,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,There might not be a next season for me. That was my golden opportunity!,2024-09-03 22:01:06
8615,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,You're being impossible. This isn't just about you. The team relies on you being healthy.,2024-09-03 22:06:06
8616,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,"Oh really? You think the team cares about me now? Thanks to you, I'm benched.",2024-09-03 22:10:06
8617,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,"If you were my friend, you’d understand why I did it. I care about your well-being.",2024-09-03 22:17:06
8618,escalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,You care? It sure doesn’t feel like it. Friends don’t sabotage each other’s dreams,2024-09-03 22:26:06
8619,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you submit your section of the group project on time, Carl?",2024-09-03 21:18:09
8620,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"I have a lot on my plate right now, Emma. I’ve got other classes and commitments.",2024-09-03 21:19:09
8621,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"We all have other classes, Carl! That’s no excuse. You’re jeopardizing our grade.",2024-09-03 21:26:09
8622,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_3,"Guys, let’s just figure out a way to get it done. We can still work together on this.",2024-09-03 21:27:09
8623,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"Easy for you to say, Matt. Your part was already done. I’m not a machine!",2024-09-03 21:29:09
8624,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"Maybe if you managed your time better, we wouldn’t be in this mess. Ever thought of that?",2024-09-03 21:30:09
8625,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"Oh, you’re one to talk, Emma. You were late to two of our meetings last week!",2024-09-03 21:34:09
8626,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_3,Can we stop pointing fingers? The deadline is in two days. Let’s focus on what’s left to do.,2024-09-03 21:39:09
8627,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"No, Matt. Carl needs to own up to his responsibilities. This isn't the first time he’s let us down.",2024-09-03 21:43:09
8628,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"You know what, Emma? Maybe if you weren’t so overbearing, I’d actually be motivated to contribute.",2024-09-03 21:48:09
8629,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_3,"Seriously, guys, enough! We’re wasting time. Arguing isn’t going to finish the project.",2024-09-03 21:49:09
8630,escalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"Fine, Matt. But Carl, if you don’t pull your weight this time, I’ll make",2024-09-03 21:51:09
8631,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"You seriously lost the keys again? This is the third time this month, Tom!",2024-09-03 21:11:12
8632,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sue. It's not like I did it on purpose. Can you stop nagging me about every little mistake?",2024-09-03 21:18:12
8633,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"Little mistake? We were locked out of our apartment for an hour last night. How is that a ""little mistake""?",2024-09-03 21:19:12
8634,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't always fill up the key rack with your random junk, I wouldn't keep losing them!",2024-09-03 21:23:12
8635,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"Random junk? Those are important documents and bills. If you actually cared about organizing things, it wouldn't be a mess!",2024-09-03 21:31:12
8636,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"Don't turn this into my fault. You're just as disorganized, if not more.",2024-09-03 21:32:12
8637,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,That's rich coming from someone who can’t even keep track of a single pair of keys.,2024-09-03 21:38:12
8638,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,You never appreciate anything I do. All you do is focus on the negatives. It's suffocating.,2024-09-03 21:46:12
8639,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"I wouldn't need to nag if you acted more responsibly. We are partners, right? This is supposed to be a team effort.",2024-09-03 21:55:12
8640,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"A team effort? Feels more like you're my boss, criticizing every move I make.",2024-09-03 22:05:12
8641,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"Maybe if you stepped up a bit, I wouldn’t feel the need to micromanage everything.",2024-09-03 22:12:12
8642,escalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"Fine, maybe I will step up—by stepping out. Let’s see how you handle things",2024-09-03 22:13:12
8643,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead with the project without consulting me first!,2024-09-03 21:16:16
8644,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"Consult you? We didn't have time, and you were nowhere to be found!",2024-09-03 21:19:16
8645,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,Nowhere to be found? I had a family emergency. You know that!,2024-09-03 21:28:16
8646,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"Well, emergencies or not, deadlines don't wait. We had to act.",2024-09-03 21:31:16
8647,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_3,"Guys, let's not forget we were all under pressure. Let's figure out a solution.",2024-09-03 21:32:16
8648,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you weren't sidelined in the decision-making process.",2024-09-03 21:34:16
8649,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,Sidelined? We've all been shouldering the work equally.,2024-09-03 21:42:16
8650,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_3,"Look, if we keep fighting, we're just going to waste more time.",2024-09-03 21:52:16
8651,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,"I'm not fighting. I'm just saying we have a process to follow, and it was ignored.",2024-09-03 22:00:16
8652,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"Processes are important, sure. But flexibility is key when things go wrong.",2024-09-03 22:07:16
8653,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,Flexibility shouldn't mean making unilateral decisions!,2024-09-03 22:13:16
8654,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_3,"Alright, let's take a step back. Can we agree to review what was done and move forward from here?",2024-09-03 22:20:16
8655,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"Fine, but we can't slow down. We have deliverables to meet.",2024-09-03 22:28:16
8656,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,I just want us to ensure we're on the same page next time. Communication matters.,2024-09-03 22:29:16
8657,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's improve that and not let emergencies disrupt our workflow again.,2024-09-03 22:36:16
8658,escalatory_conversation_586,speaker_3,"Good,",2024-09-03 22:43:16
8659,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were planning to leave the band?,2024-09-03 21:14:19
8660,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,Maybe because you never listen to anyone's ideas!,2024-09-03 21:16:19
8661,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,That's not true! I always ask for input.,2024-09-03 21:25:19
8662,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,"Sure, you ask, but you never actually consider anything we say. It's always your way or the highway.",2024-09-03 21:26:19
8663,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,"Guys, can we chill for a second? We're supposed to be preparing for the gig.",2024-09-03 21:34:19
8664,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,"No, this is important. I had no idea you felt this way.",2024-09-03 21:44:19
8665,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,"Well, maybe you should have noticed sooner. I'm not the only one who's frustrated.",2024-09-03 21:47:19
8666,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_4,"Yeah, we're all tired of feeling like we're just your backing band.",2024-09-03 21:50:19
8667,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,This isn't helping. We have to focus on the music right now.,2024-09-03 21:53:19
8668,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,How am I supposed to focus when everyone's trying to bail on me?,2024-09-03 21:55:19
8669,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,"Maybe if you weren't so controlling, we'd all want to stay.",2024-09-03 22:00:19
8670,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_4,"Exactly. It's supposed to be a collaboration, not a dictatorship.",2024-09-03 22:09:19
8671,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,"I'm just trying to keep us on track. Maybe if you all took it more seriously, I'd back off.",2024-09-03 22:18:19
8672,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,This is getting us nowhere. Can we please just practice for the gig?,2024-09-03 22:20:19
8673,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,"Look, if things don't change after the gig, I'm out. And I bet others will follow.",2024-09-03 22:21:19
8674,escalatory_conversation_587,speaker_4,Same here. We're a band,2024-09-03 22:25:19
8675,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"I can't believe you did that during the presentation, Kelly. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:11:23
8676,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Mark. I just added some humor to lighten the mood.",2024-09-03 21:19:23
8677,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,Humor? You completely derailed our serious proposal! The board was not impressed.,2024-09-03 21:29:23
8678,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,"Well, maybe they needed to lighten up a little. We can't always be so stiff and boring.",2024-09-03 21:39:23
8679,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"We were supposed to be professional. This was a huge opportunity for us, and you made us look unprepared.",2024-09-03 21:46:23
8680,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,So it's all my fault now? It's not like the rest of your slides were groundbreaking!,2024-09-03 21:55:23
8681,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,At least my slides stuck to the plan! Yours just confused everyone and wasted time.,2024-09-03 21:57:23
8682,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,"You always think you know best, don't you? Maybe if you listened to others, we'd actually be more successful.",2024-09-03 22:03:23
8683,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"I've been listening; that's why I created an organized, impactful presentation. You just don't take things seriously.",2024-09-03 22:07:23
8684,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,And you just want everything your way. Ever heard of teamwork?,2024-09-03 22:13:23
8685,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,Teamwork doesn't mean going off-script and ruining months of preparation!,2024-09-03 22:16:23
8686,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,And following your script hasn't exactly worked wonders for us before. Maybe it's time to try something new.,2024-09-03 22:19:23
8687,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,Trying something new doesn't mean blindsiding your team during a crucial moment!,2024-09-03 22:20:23
8688,escalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,At least I had the guts to do something different. You're,2024-09-03 22:30:23
8689,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back and took credit for the project, Alex!",2024-09-03 21:10:26
8690,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,"I didn't go behind your back, Mia. You were dragging your feet, and someone had to step up.",2024-09-03 21:16:26
8691,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,Dragging my feet? I was working late every night while you were barely contributing!,2024-09-03 21:19:26
8692,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,That's not true! I handled the presentation and made sure everything was ready for the meeting!,2024-09-03 21:23:26
8693,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_3,"Guys, what's going on? I can hear you from my office.",2024-09-03 21:32:26
8694,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,Alex here decided to take full credit for our team project without even mentioning my part!,2024-09-03 21:40:26
8695,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,Mia's just upset because I took initiative when she was slacking.,2024-09-03 21:47:26
8696,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_3,This isn't helping anything. Let's figure out what happened and fix it.,2024-09-03 21:50:26
8697,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,Fix it? The damage is already done! Our manager thinks I did nothing!,2024-09-03 21:59:26
8698,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,"Maybe if you actually communicated, this wouldn't have happened.",2024-09-03 22:06:26
8699,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_3,"Okay, both of you need to calm down. We need a constructive approach, not accusations.",2024-09-03 22:11:26
8700,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,"Easy for you to say, you're not the one who's been undermined.",2024-09-03 22:17:26
8701,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,And you're not the one who had to pick up the slack at the last minute!,2024-09-03 22:22:26
8702,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_3,We need to focus on resolving this. How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 22:23:26
8703,escalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,"I want an acknowledgment of my work, at the very",2024-09-03 22:24:26
8704,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,You seriously couldn't clean up your section of the art room?,2024-09-03 21:15:30
8705,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,"Oh, come on! I was the one who stayed late last time to clean up your mess!",2024-09-03 21:25:30
8706,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,My mess? That's hilarious. I wasn't the one who spilled paint everywhere this week.,2024-09-03 21:35:30
8707,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,That was an accident! And at least I didn't leave my brushes in the sink to get ruined.,2024-09-03 21:43:30
8708,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,"Just admit it, you're lazy when it comes to clean-up. This project is going to fail because of you.",2024-09-03 21:48:30
8709,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,Are you kidding me? I'm the only one who's been putting in any effort. You just want to boss everyone around.,2024-09-03 21:49:30
8710,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,Boss everyone around? I'm trying to make sure we have a presentable space for the gallery show next week.,2024-09-03 21:57:30
8711,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you weren't so obsessed with perfection, you'd realize the rest of us actually care about our art too!",2024-09-03 22:06:30
8712,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,Obsessed with perfection? That's rich coming from someone who barely finishes their paintings on time.,2024-09-03 22:16:30
8713,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,"I've had enough of your insults. You think you're so much better than everyone else, but you're not.",2024-09-03 22:26:30
8714,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,And I've had enough of your sloppiness dragging us down. Maybe we should just split up the project.,2024-09-03 22:36:30
8715,escalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,Fine with me! I'll work with people who actually know how to collaborate without throwing tantrums.,2024-09-03 22:37:30
8716,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,Why didn't you submit the project on time?,2024-09-03 21:09:33
8717,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,"I told you yesterday, I was swamped with other work!",2024-09-03 21:16:33
8718,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,That’s not an excuse! We had a deadline and you knew it!,2024-09-03 21:17:33
8719,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you had helped more, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:18:33
8720,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,Are you serious? I did most of the research and you barely showed up for meetings!,2024-09-03 21:26:33
8721,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,I had other commitments! You know that!,2024-09-03 21:34:33
8722,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,We all have commitments! It's called managing your time!,2024-09-03 21:38:33
8723,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,"Oh, like you’re perfect? You missed half the meetings too!",2024-09-03 21:47:33
8724,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,Because I was picking up the slack you left behind!,2024-09-03 21:56:33
8725,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,Don't you dare put this all on me. You’re the one who's awful at communicating!,2024-09-03 22:01:33
8726,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,We wouldn’t have had these issues if you answered your phone!,2024-09-03 22:06:33
8727,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,"Yeah, well, maybe I ignored your calls because they were always about you whining!",2024-09-03 22:11:33
8728,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,Whining? I was trying to keep this project afloat!,2024-09-03 22:14:33
8729,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,You’re impossible! No wonder no one wants to work with you!,2024-09-03 22:16:33
8730,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,"And you’re useless! Nice team player, huh?",2024-09-03 22:23:33
8731,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,This is ridiculous. I’m done talking to you.,2024-09-03 22:27:33
8732,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,"Fine, go ahead! I’ll finish the project myself as usual!",2024-09-03 22:36:33
8733,escalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,Good luck,2024-09-03 22:46:33

8735,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Sarah. It's just a chocolate bar. Stop being so dramatic.",2024-09-03 21:27:36
8736,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,It's not about the chocolate bar; it's about respect. You never think about anyone else!,2024-09-03 21:35:36
8737,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"Respect? Give me a break. You took the last soda yesterday, and I didn't whine about it.",2024-09-03 21:45:36
8738,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,"That's different! I asked if anyone wanted it first, unlike you.",2024-09-03 21:48:36
8739,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't nag so much, I'd be more inclined to ask!",2024-09-03 21:52:36
8740,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,"Nag? I'm just asking for basic courtesy, but I guess that's too much for you!",2024-09-03 22:02:36
8741,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"Oh, here we go again with the ""basic courtesy"" lecture.",2024-09-03 22:03:36
8742,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,"Maybe if you learned it, I wouldn't have to lecture you!",2024-09-03 22:07:36
8743,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"You act like you're my parent or something. Get off your high horse, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:09:36
8744,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,I'm just trying to make this living situation bearable for everyone!,2024-09-03 22:16:36
8745,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,More like unbearable with how controlling you are!,2024-09-03 22:20:36
8746,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,I wouldn't have to be if you acted like an adult for once!,2024-09-03 22:21:36
8747,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,Acting like an adult doesn't mean catering to your every whim!,2024-09-03 22:30:36
8748,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,"Fine, then. Just don't expect any favors from me in the future.",2024-09-03 22:39:36
8749,escalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"Trust me, I won't. And don't expect me to suddenly",2024-09-03 22:42:36
8750,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,"Why didn't you ever tell me you were applying for the promotion, Lisa?",2024-09-03 21:15:40
8751,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"Honestly, Mark, I didn't think it was any of your business.",2024-09-03 21:21:40
8752,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,Not any of my business? We've been working on this project together for two years! How is that not relevant to me?,2024-09-03 21:27:40
8753,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,Because my career plans are my own concern. Just like yours are your concern.,2024-09-03 21:28:40
8754,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,But it affects the whole team! Your decision changes everything!,2024-09-03 21:34:40
8755,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"Maybe, but that doesn't give you the right to be upset with me for pursuing my own goals.",2024-09-03 21:44:40
8756,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,The least you could have done is inform us. We deserve to know about these big changes.,2024-09-03 21:53:40
8757,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,Inform you about what? That I'm trying to better myself? You always act like you have to control everything.,2024-09-03 21:56:40
8758,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,That's not it. I just think communication is key. Keeping secrets breeds distrust.,2024-09-03 22:03:40
8759,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"It wasn't a secret. I just didn't think it was newsworthy. Maybe if you paid more attention, you'd have known without me spelling it out.",2024-09-03 22:10:40
8760,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault? That's rich. Blaming me because you want to play coy with life-changing decisions.",2024-09-03 22:18:40
8761,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"You know what, Mark? Maybe if you weren't so obsessed with micromanaging the team, you'd realize that some things just aren't about you.",2024-09-03 22:19:40
8762,escalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,This isn't about microman,2024-09-03 22:26:40
8763,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,Why is the project still not finished? We had a deadline!,2024-09-03 21:09:43
8764,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,I've been swamped with other tasks. You know that.,2024-09-03 21:10:43
8765,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,"And I’ve been dealing with my own stuff, but I still managed to meet my deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:17:43
8766,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,"Well, not everyone works the same way. Maybe if you pitched in more, this wouldn’t have happened.",2024-09-03 21:23:43
8767,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you, let’s not turn this into a blame game. We need to figure out what went wrong and fix it.",2024-09-03 21:28:43
8768,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,It’s not about blame; it’s about responsibility. We’re all supposed to be pulling our weight here.,2024-09-03 21:38:43
8769,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,"Oh, so now I’m not pulling my weight? That’s rich coming from you.",2024-09-03 21:40:43
8770,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_3,This isn’t helpful. Let’s focus on the solution. What can we do right now to get back on track?,2024-09-03 21:46:43
8771,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,"Fine, we need to divide the remaining tasks more efficiently.",2024-09-03 21:54:43
8772,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,"Agreed, but let’s also make sure everyone actually follows through this time.",2024-09-03 22:03:43
8773,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_3,"How about we set up a check-in system to monitor progress? That way, we’re all accountable.",2024-09-03 22:06:43
8774,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,"Alright, but we need to start immediately. We can’t afford any more delays.",2024-09-03 22:16:43
8775,escalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,"Agreed, let’s get this done before it escalates any further.",2024-09-03 22:24:43
8776,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up for the charity event last night!,2024-09-03 21:14:46
8777,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,What are you talking about? I told you I had something important.,2024-09-03 21:18:46
8778,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,Something more important than helping our community? Really?,2024-09-03 21:23:46
8779,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,"Don't act all high and mighty, you missed the planning meetings for months!",2024-09-03 21:28:46
8780,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,"Because I was busy with my job, but at least I was there when it counted!",2024-09-03 21:38:46
8781,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,"Oh, so now my commitments don't count?",2024-09-03 21:39:46
8782,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,"I'm just saying, a lot of people were counting on us, and you bailed.",2024-09-03 21:45:46
8783,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,"Bailed? I was volunteering elsewhere, but I guess that doesn’t matter to you.",2024-09-03 21:47:46
8784,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,Maybe it would if you communicated better. You didn’t even tell anyone where you would be.,2024-09-03 21:51:46
8785,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,Why should I have to inform you of every single thing I do?,2024-09-03 21:55:46
8786,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,"Because we’re supposed to be a team, but you clearly don’t care about being a team player!",2024-09-03 22:02:46
8787,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,And you clearly don’t care about respecting other people’s time and commitments!,2024-09-03 22:10:46
8788,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,"If your other commitments were so crucial, you should have opted out earlier instead of last minute.",2024-09-03 22:16:46
8789,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,"I did what I thought was best, but obviously, you only care about what affects you directly!",2024-09-03 22:21:46
8790,escalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,"That’s not fair, and you know it. You know how much effort I",2024-09-03 22:23:46
8791,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,"You didn't even bother to show up for the group project meeting, Sarah. What was that about?",2024-09-03 21:12:50
8792,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"I told you I had a family emergency, Mark! You could've picked up the slack just this once.",2024-09-03 21:16:50
8793,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_3,"Family emergency or not, we’re all going to fail if we don’t finish this presentation. We needed you, Sarah!",2024-09-03 21:22:50
8794,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"Oh, like you’re so perfect, Jessica? Half the time you’re on your phone during meetings anyway.",2024-09-03 21:23:50
8795,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,Let’s not change the subject here. The point is you left us hanging without any help or information.,2024-09-03 21:28:50
8796,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"And I said I had an emergency! What do you want me to do, time travel and be at two places at once?",2024-09-03 21:38:50
8797,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_3,We just wanted some communication. A quick text or something. Is that so hard?,2024-09-03 21:48:50
8798,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,You know what’s hard? Trying to help your sick grandmother while your so-called friends keep nagging you about a presentation.,2024-09-03 21:49:50
8799,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,"We’re not mind readers, Sarah! We didn’t know what was going on because you ghosted us.",2024-09-03 21:52:50
8800,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_3,"If you could at least let us know next time, maybe we can make arrangements. We’re in this together, after all.",2024-09-03 21:56:50
8801,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,Together? Doesn’t feel like it when you two gang up on me the moment things go wrong.,2024-09-03 21:59:50
8802,escalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,We wouldn’t have to,2024-09-03 22:01:50
8803,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot to pick up the cake, again.",2024-09-03 21:14:53
8804,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,"Oh, don't start with me. You know I've had a rough week at work.",2024-09-03 21:16:53
8805,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,It's always about your work. It's not like I don't have things going on too!,2024-09-03 21:19:53
8806,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,Really? What things? Watching TV and gossiping with your friends?,2024-09-03 21:24:53
8807,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,That's incredibly unfair. Just because I work from home doesn't mean I don't have responsibilities.,2024-09-03 21:34:53
8808,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,"Maybe if you managed your time better, we wouldn't be in this mess.",2024-09-03 21:43:53
8809,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,Are you seriously blaming me? You had one thing to do today!,2024-09-03 21:53:53
8810,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,And you expect me to do everything while you sit around all day?,2024-09-03 21:55:53
8811,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,You know that's not true. You're just making excuses for your own mistakes.,2024-09-03 22:04:53
8812,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,"Oh, I see. So you're perfect and I'm always wrong, is that it?",2024-09-03 22:11:53
8813,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,"If you cared enough, you'd make an effort instead of blaming me.",2024-09-03 22:18:53
8814,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,"Maybe if you didn't nitpick every little thing, I'd be more motivated to help.",2024-09-03 22:27:53
8815,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,Nitpick? You call forgetting our anniversary nitpicking?,2024-09-03 22:31:53
8816,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if it was a two-way street, I'd remember more often.",2024-09-03 22:33:53
8817,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,This is ridiculous. I'm not putting up with this anymore.,2024-09-03 22:42:53
8818,escalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,Fine! Maybe some time apart would do us both good,2024-09-03 22:44:53
8819,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted that report without showing it to me first.,2024-09-03 21:11:56
8820,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,You knew I was on a tight deadline. We didn't have time for another review.,2024-09-03 21:18:56
8821,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,That's no excuse. There were errors all over the place!,2024-09-03 21:25:56
8822,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you had actually helped instead of criticizing, we wouldn't be in this mess!",2024-09-03 21:34:56
8823,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,Are you kidding me? I was waiting for you to send it my way. You didn't even give me a heads-up.,2024-09-03 21:39:56
8824,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,You should have known I needed help. It's not my job to chase you around.,2024-09-03 21:48:56
8825,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,"Fine, it's my fault now? If you can't handle the pressure, admit it!",2024-09-03 21:53:56
8826,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,"Oh, so you're perfect now? Your last report wasn't exactly flawless either.",2024-09-03 21:55:56
8827,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,At least I take responsibility for my mistakes instead of blaming everyone else.,2024-09-03 21:59:56
8828,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,Responsibility? Like disappearing whenever there's a crunch time?,2024-09-03 22:05:56
8829,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,That's rich coming from you. When was the last time you finished a project on your own?,2024-09-03 22:13:56
8830,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,"Maybe if I didn't have to clean up after your messes, I'd have the chance to!",2024-09-03 22:14:56
8831,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,"I'm done with this. If working together means dealing with your tantrums, count me out.",2024-09-03 22:20:56
8832,escalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,"Trust me, the feeling is mutual.",2024-09-03 22:23:56
8833,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,"I cannot believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without discussing it with us first, Maria.",2024-09-03 21:17:00
8834,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,"Are you serious, Jack? You were the one who was procrastinating and holding us back in the first place.",2024-09-03 21:25:00
8835,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_3,"Both of you stop it! This isn't helping. Why did you even take that decision alone, Maria?",2024-09-03 21:35:00
8836,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,"Because I was tired of waiting for you guys to finish your parts! We have deadlines, you know.",2024-09-03 21:37:00
8837,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,We still had a day left. You could have at least run it by us before hitting submit!,2024-09-03 21:39:00
8838,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_3,"Yeah, Maria, that wasn't a team decision. We were all planning to go over it one final time together.",2024-09-03 21:48:00
8839,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,"Oh please, as if you guys actually contribute anything useful during those reviews. It's just Jack nitpicking over tiny details!",2024-09-03 21:56:00
8840,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,"That's called quality control, Maria! Something you obviously don't care about.",2024-09-03 22:02:00
8841,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_3,"This isn't productive! Look, we need to figure out how to address any feedback and salvage our grade.",2024-09-03 22:09:00
8842,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,You know what? Just do whatever you want. I’m done getting blamed for trying to save this project.,2024-09-03 22:15:00
8843,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,Save it? More like sabotage it. You've seriously messed this up for all of us.,2024-09-03 22:17:00
8844,escalatory_conversation_599,speaker_3,"Enough! If we keep attacking each other, we'll get nowhere. We need to focus on fixing this together.",2024-09-03 22:22:00
8845,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and presented the project without even telling me!,2024-09-03 21:14:03
8846,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,"You weren't around, and the deadline was looming. What did you expect me to do?",2024-09-03 21:22:03
8847,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,I expected you to wait for me! We've been working on this together for weeks.,2024-09-03 21:32:03
8848,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,"Wait? We would have missed the deadline! And where were you anyway? Too busy to care, apparently.",2024-09-03 21:36:03
8849,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,"That's not fair! I had a family emergency, and you knew that.",2024-09-03 21:42:03
8850,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,"Sure, always an excuse. You could have at least sent a text or an email.",2024-09-03 21:45:03
8851,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,"Oh, so now it's my fault for having a family emergency? Great teamwork.",2024-09-03 21:54:03
8852,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,It's not just about one thing. You've been unreliable the whole time we've been working on this.,2024-09-03 22:00:03
8853,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,Unreliable? I've been pulling my weight and more! Remember who did all the research?,2024-09-03 22:04:03
8854,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,And who put it all together into a coherent presentation? That would be me.,2024-09-03 22:12:03
8855,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,Doesn't give you the right to make decisions without consulting me.,2024-09-03 22:13:03
8856,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,"Maybe if you were more present, you'd have a say in those decisions.",2024-09-03 22:17:03
8857,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,"That's low, even for you. We had a partnership, or at least I thought we did.",2024-09-03 22:26:03
8858,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,Maybe it's just better this way. Less drama.,2024-09-03 22:31:03
8859,escalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,Drama? You’re the one who created,2024-09-03 22:36:03
8860,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,"Clara, why didn't you tell me you were hosting a study group at my place tonight?",2024-09-03 21:16:07
8861,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,"Oh, Maya, I thought you wouldn't mind. You’re always so busy, and I figured the living room wasn't off-limits.",2024-09-03 21:26:07
8862,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,It's not about that. I had planned to have a quiet night and maybe even watch a movie. Could you at least give me a heads-up next time?,2024-09-03 21:32:07
8863,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,You're right. I should have asked first. I'm sorry for springing this on you without notice.,2024-09-03 21:42:07
8864,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,I appreciate the apology. Can we set some ground rules for using shared spaces for events?,2024-09-03 21:46:07
8865,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,Absolutely. How about a 24-hour notice for any gatherings? Does that sound fair?,2024-09-03 21:55:07
8866,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,"That sounds reasonable. And maybe we can agree on certain times when the apartment should stay quiet, like late evenings?",2024-09-03 22:00:07
8867,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,Late evenings are fine with me. How about no loud activities after 9 PM?,2024-09-03 22:03:07
8868,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,Perfect. Thanks for understanding. I don't want us to have to tiptoe around each other.,2024-09-03 22:05:07
8869,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,"Me neither. We're both living here, so sharing these spaces should be comfortable for both of us.",2024-09-03 22:07:07
8870,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,Agreed. How long is the study group planning to stay tonight?,2024-09-03 22:11:07
8871,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_2,They should be out by 9. I'll make sure to remind everyone.,2024-09-03 22:18:07
8872,deescalatory_conversation_1,speaker_1,"Thanks, Clara. Let’s keep",2024-09-03 22:19:07
8873,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,"Jake, I noticed you missed quite a few passes during today's game. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:13:11
8874,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,"Coach, I know. I just wasn't feeling it today. It wasn't intentional.",2024-09-03 21:22:11
8875,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,"I get that, but it seemed like you were a bit unfocused. Did something happen earlier?",2024-09-03 21:25:11
8876,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,Maybe I'm just tired. It's been a tough week with school and everything.,2024-09-03 21:28:11
8877,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,I understand that balancing school and sports can be tough. Is there anything specific that’s been particularly stressful?,2024-09-03 21:35:11
8878,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,"Yeah, I've got a big exam coming up and I haven't been sleeping well.",2024-09-03 21:38:11
8879,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,"That makes a lot of sense, Jake. Sleep and stress can really impact your performance. Have you tried talking to your teachers about it?",2024-09-03 21:45:11
8880,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,"Not really, I'm afraid they'll think I'm just making excuses.",2024-09-03 21:52:11
8881,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,I think you'll find that most teachers are understanding if you're honest with them. Maybe you could ask for a little more time to study or some advice on managing the workload.,2024-09-03 21:54:11
8882,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,You think that would really help?,2024-09-03 22:00:11
8883,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,"Absolutely. And in the meantime, let's focus on how you can manage your energy better. Maybe taking short breaks during study sessions could help?",2024-09-03 22:03:11
8884,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. I guess I haven't been managing my time very well.,2024-09-03 22:09:11
8885,deescalatory_conversation_2,speaker_1,"It's all a learning process, Jake. The important thing is that",2024-09-03 22:11:11
8886,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"You know, I saw your name on the debate team list. You never told me you were joining.",2024-09-03 21:16:15
8887,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,"Yeah, I'm sorry, I guess it slipped my mind. But why does it matter so much?",2024-09-03 21:26:15
8888,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,It matters because we promised to tell each other everything. Especially big stuff like this.,2024-09-03 21:33:15
8889,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,"You're right, we did. I guess I was worried you might think it was silly or something.",2024-09-03 21:40:15
8890,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,Silly? I think it's awesome! I just wish you had trusted me enough to share.,2024-09-03 21:43:15
8891,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,I didn't think of it that way. I promise I'll be more open next time.,2024-09-03 21:53:15
8892,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"Thanks. And honestly, I can't wait to watch you in action at the debates. Supporting you all the way.",2024-09-03 22:01:15
8893,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,That means a lot. Let's make sure we keep our promises to each other from now on.,2024-09-03 22:03:15
8894,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"Absolutely. And if there's anything else you want to get off your chest, I'm all ears.",2024-09-03 22:04:15
8895,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,"Actually, there is one more thing I was hesitant to bring up. I'm thinking of running for class president.",2024-09-03 22:12:15
8896,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,That's incredible! Why didn't you say something sooner?,2024-09-03 22:22:15
8897,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_2,I didn't want to overwhelm you with too much at once. But I see now that sharing makes us stronger.,2024-09-03 22:28:15
8898,deescalatory_conversation_3,speaker_1,"Exactly. Together, we can handle anything. Go for it, and I'll help however I can",2024-09-03 22:32:15
8899,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,"I can't believe you submitted the project without consulting the rest of the team, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:18:19
8900,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,I did consult you guys! I asked for feedback in the group chat.,2024-09-03 21:22:19
8901,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_3,"A quick message in the group chat isn't the same as a detailed discussion, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:26:19
8902,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,I was trying to save time. The deadline was approaching fast.,2024-09-03 21:35:19
8903,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,But now the project is missing some crucial data that we hadn't finalized.,2024-09-03 21:41:19
8904,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. How can we fix this?",2024-09-03 21:50:19
8905,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_3,Maybe we can send out a revised version with the missing data and an explanation.,2024-09-03 21:51:19
8906,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,That's a good idea. It shows we acknowledge the oversight and are willing to correct it.,2024-09-03 21:52:19
8907,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,"I'll draft the revised section, and we can all review it together.",2024-09-03 22:01:19
8908,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,Sounds good. How soon can you have it ready?,2024-09-03 22:11:19
8909,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,I can have it by this evening. Will that work?,2024-09-03 22:21:19
8910,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_3,"Yes, that works. Let's meet at 7 PM to go over it.",2024-09-03 22:22:19
8911,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks, Sarah, for understanding the importance of including everyone's input.",2024-09-03 22:24:19
8912,deescalatory_conversation_4,speaker_2,I appreciate that. Let's make this a team effort.,2024-09-03 22:33:19
8913,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"Why did you take my sketchpad without asking, again?",2024-09-03 21:12:21
8914,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,I just needed to borrow it for my art project. I didn't think you'd mind.,2024-09-03 21:14:21
8915,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"But you didn't ask me! It's not the first time, and it's becoming a habit.",2024-09-03 21:23:21
8916,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,I didn't realize it upset you this much. I'm sorry. How can I make it up to you?,2024-09-03 21:26:21
8917,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,I just want you to ask me before taking my stuff. It's not just about the sketchpad.,2024-09-03 21:35:21
8918,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,"Okay, I promise to ask next time. Can we talk about sharing schedules, so we don't overlap on our projects?",2024-09-03 21:40:21
8919,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Maybe we can create a calendar for when we need to use certain materials?,2024-09-03 21:48:21
8920,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,"Yeah, that would help. I'll start making one tonight, and we can fill it out together.",2024-09-03 21:57:21
8921,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_1,"Alright, that works. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:04:21
8922,deescalatory_conversation_5,speaker_2,Thanks for being patient with me. I'll work on respecting your space more.,2024-09-03 22:07:21
8923,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for our project meeting again, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:15:24
8924,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Jake. My schedule has been crazy lately.",2024-09-03 21:19:24
8925,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,"But we've planned this for weeks! This project is due soon, and we need everyone on board.",2024-09-03 21:23:24
8926,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I had an emergency at home. Is there any way we can catch up on what I missed?",2024-09-03 21:27:24
8927,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,"We covered a lot, and it's frustrating to have to repeat everything. But I get you're under pressure too.",2024-09-03 21:34:24
8928,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,I appreciate that. I can stay late today to go over the notes if that works for you.,2024-09-03 21:37:24
8929,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,That might help. Let's meet right after class and go through everything together.,2024-09-03 21:47:24
8930,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,Sounds good. I'll bring all the materials and make sure I'm prepared this time.,2024-09-03 21:56:24
8931,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,"Okay, let’s make sure everyone is up to date so we can finish strong.",2024-09-03 22:01:24
8932,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for understanding, Jake. I'll do my best to be more reliable.",2024-09-03 22:06:24
8933,deescalatory_conversation_6,speaker_1,And I'll try to be more flexible. Let's just get through this project.,2024-09-03 22:10:24
8934,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,"I saw you took my presentation slides, Mark. Why didn't you ask first?",2024-09-03 21:17:28
8935,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,"I was running out of time, Jane. I thought it would be faster to just use them quickly.",2024-09-03 21:23:28
8936,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,But those were my notes and ideas. You should've at least told me.,2024-09-03 21:24:28
8937,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,I get that. I really didn't mean to take them without permission. I just panicked.,2024-09-03 21:32:28
8938,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,"Panicked? You're usually pretty good with your time management, Mark. What happened?",2024-09-03 21:33:28
8939,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,"I underestimated how much time I'd need to finish my part, and then some unexpected issues popped up.",2024-09-03 21:39:28
8940,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,I wish you'd trusted me enough to ask for help or even just the slides at the very least.,2024-09-03 21:43:28
8941,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,"You're right. I should've communicated better. In the future, I'll make sure to ask or let you know if something like this happens again.",2024-09-03 21:48:28
8942,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,Thank you. It really threw me off when I found out. But I appreciate you being honest about it now.,2024-09-03 21:52:28
8943,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,I completely understand. I'll be more considerate next time. Let's make sure we don't let this affect our teamwork.,2024-09-03 21:57:28
8944,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's plan a bit more time for the next project to avoid these last-minute scrambles.,2024-09-03 22:07:28
8945,deescalatory_conversation_7,speaker_2,"That's a good idea. Together, we'll make sure everything runs smoother.",2024-09-03 22:13:28
8946,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,"Hey, Sam, I noticed you didn't pull your weight on the group project again. We've talked about this.",2024-09-03 21:16:33
8947,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"I was really busy with other assignments, Jake. I was counting on you to handle it.",2024-09-03 21:18:33
8948,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,It's not fair to expect me to do everything. This project was supposed to be a team effort.,2024-09-03 21:25:33
8949,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Yeah, but I didn't hear you complaining when we got an A last time.",2024-09-03 21:28:33
8950,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,"That's not the point. If we keep up like this, it's just going to create more stress for both of us, and our grades might suffer.",2024-09-03 21:32:33
8951,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Okay, but what do you want me to do about it now? The project is almost due.",2024-09-03 21:39:33
8952,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,I want us to figure out how to divide the work evenly from now on. Maybe make a schedule or checklist.,2024-09-03 21:45:33
8953,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Fine, I get it. I could've communicated better. Let's make the schedule then. What tasks are left?",2024-09-03 21:47:33
8954,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,We still need to compile the research and proofread the final report. Can you handle the research while I proofread?,2024-09-03 21:56:33
8955,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can do that. I'll start on the research tonight and have it done by tomorrow.",2024-09-03 22:00:33
8956,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_1,"Perfect, I'll get started on the proofreading as soon as I get your part. Let's touch base again tomorrow night to make sure everything is on track.",2024-09-03 22:06:33
8957,deescalatory_conversation_8,speaker_2,Sounds good. Thanks for,2024-09-03 22:09:33
8958,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without telling us, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:17:37
8959,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, but the deadline was closing in, and we needed to submit something, Matt.",2024-09-03 21:24:37
8960,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,"Sarah, you should've at least messaged us. We could've given our inputs before you finalized it.",2024-09-03 21:27:37
8961,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,"I understand, Emily. I just panicked and thought it was better to submit what we had than miss the deadline entirely.",2024-09-03 21:34:37
8962,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,"But now if there's any mistake, we're all going to get blamed for it.",2024-09-03 21:37:37
8963,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,"I get that, Matt. Why don't we go over the submitted version together and make a list of potential corrections to discuss with the professor?",2024-09-03 21:46:37
8964,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,That's a good start. We could also ask if we can submit a revised version.,2024-09-03 21:51:37
8965,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,"Okay, fair enough. I still feel out of the loop, but working together on fixes might help us salvage this.",2024-09-03 22:00:37
8966,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,"It won't happen again, I promise. I'll make sure we're all on the same page next time.",2024-09-03 22:02:37
8967,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,Sounds like a plan. Let's focus on turning this around and doing the best we can with what we have.,2024-09-03 22:09:37
8968,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's get to work on reviewing the project then.,2024-09-03 22:19:37
8969,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_2,Thank you both for understanding. I'll pull up the submitted file now.,2024-09-03 22:28:37
8970,deescalatory_conversation_9,speaker_3,"Great, we'll tackle this together.",2024-09-03 22:37:37
8971,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,"I can't believe you messed up the project presentation, Sarah. We worked so hard on it!",2024-09-03 21:12:41
8972,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,"I know, Jake, but the slides weren't loading properly. It wasn't entirely my fault.",2024-09-03 21:22:41
8973,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,You should have tested it beforehand! Now we've likely lost the client.,2024-09-03 21:30:41
8974,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,"Let's take a step back, both of you. We can learn from this and improve for next time.",2024-09-03 21:34:41
8975,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,It's just frustrating because we had it all planned out so perfectly.,2024-09-03 21:44:41
8976,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,"I get that, but technical issues can happen to anyone. Maybe we should have a backup plan next time.",2024-09-03 21:46:41
8977,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,That's a good idea. Let's brainstorm some solutions together instead of dwelling on what went wrong.,2024-09-03 21:52:41
8978,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,I suppose having a USB copy or printed slides could help in future presentations.,2024-09-03 21:59:41
8979,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,And maybe we could designate someone to check the technical setup before we start.,2024-09-03 22:04:41
8980,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,Great suggestions. It sounds like we're on the right track to prevent this issue from happening again.,2024-09-03 22:11:41
8981,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,"Alright, I feel better knowing we have a plan. Let's focus on how we can still salvage the client relationship.",2024-09-03 22:18:41
8982,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_2,Agreed. We could offer them a follow-up meeting to demonstrate our commitment.,2024-09-03 22:26:41
8983,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_3,And perhaps a small discount as a gesture of goodwill.,2024-09-03 22:35:41
8984,deescalatory_conversation_10,speaker_1,Good points. Let's send them an email outlining our new protective measures and propose a follow-up discussion,2024-09-03 22:38:41
8985,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,"Jake, why didn't you pass the ball?",2024-09-03 21:19:44
8986,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,"Because I thought I had a clear shot, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:26:44
8987,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,But you didn't! We lost possession because of that.,2024-09-03 21:35:44
8988,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_3,"It's easy to blame one person, but we all made mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:45:44
8989,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,"Exactly, it's not like I intentionally messed up.",2024-09-03 21:53:44
8990,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,"I get that, but you should have passed. We could have scored.",2024-09-03 22:03:44
8991,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,"Maybe, but we need to trust each other's decisions on the field.",2024-09-03 22:12:44
8992,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_3,Arguing won't change what happened. What can we do better next time?,2024-09-03 22:15:44
8993,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,We need better communication. I should have called for the pass louder.,2024-09-03 22:22:44
8994,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,And I need to scan the field more instead of just focusing on my own chance.,2024-09-03 22:29:44
8995,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_3,"Agreed, and as a team, we need to support each other, not point fingers after mistakes.",2024-09-03 22:34:44
8996,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_1,You're right. We're in this together.,2024-09-03 22:38:44
8997,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_2,"Yeah, let's focus on winning the next game.",2024-09-03 22:40:44
8998,deescalatory_conversation_11,speaker_3,"Teamwork and better communication, guys. We got this!",2024-09-03 22:42:44
8999,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead with the project without consulting me, David.",2024-09-03 21:16:47
9000,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,"Emma, I didn't have time to discuss it with everyone. The deadline was approaching.",2024-09-03 21:21:47
9001,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"That's not an excuse. We are a team, and you made a decision that affected all of us.",2024-09-03 21:24:47
9002,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,"I get that, but I thought it was the best way to move things forward.",2024-09-03 21:32:47
9003,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,You should have sent at least a quick message. I'd have been fine with being kept in the loop.,2024-09-03 21:42:47
9004,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,You're right. A message would have been better. I apologize for that.,2024-09-03 21:46:47
9005,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"Apology accepted. But next time, let's make sure we communicate better.",2024-09-03 21:56:47
9006,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,Agreed. Would you like to go over the details of what I did so far?,2024-09-03 22:01:47
9007,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,"Yes, I think that would help. Let's see if we can align our thoughts and improve the project together.",2024-09-03 22:08:47
9008,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,"Sounds good. I think if we combine our ideas, the final outcome will be much stronger.",2024-09-03 22:12:47
9009,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let's make sure we address any potential issues upfront and keep everyone in the loop.,2024-09-03 22:13:47
9010,deescalatory_conversation_12,speaker_2,Great plan. Let's get started.,2024-09-03 22:14:47
9011,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"Hey, you promised you'd have the group project draft ready by today. Where is it?",2024-09-03 21:14:51
9012,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,"I know, I'm really sorry. I've just been swamped with other classes and work.",2024-09-03 21:20:51
9013,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,Swamped? We've all got stuff going on. You should have managed your time better.,2024-09-03 21:28:51
9014,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have. But I really didn't expect things to pile up like this. Can we figure out a way to get back on track?",2024-09-03 21:29:51
9015,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"How? We're already behind, and now we have to catch up because of you.",2024-09-03 21:39:51
9016,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,Maybe we can split the remaining parts between us and make up the lost time together?,2024-09-03 21:48:51
9017,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_3,"Wait, is this about the project? What's the plan now, guys?",2024-09-03 21:53:51
9018,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"Yeah, it is. Looks like we need a new plan because someone couldn't keep up.",2024-09-03 21:55:51
9019,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_3,"Okay, calm down. Let's just figure this out. What parts are left to do?",2024-09-03 21:56:51
9020,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,We still need to finalize the research and the presentation slides. I can take the research part.,2024-09-03 22:02:51
9021,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,"Fine, but you need to get it done this time. No excuses.",2024-09-03 22:09:51
9022,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_2,Agreed. And I'll make sure to keep you both updated.,2024-09-03 22:13:51
9023,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_3,"Alright, and I'll work on the presentation slides. We can review everything together before submitting it.",2024-09-03 22:18:51
9024,deescalatory_conversation_13,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. Let's make,2024-09-03 22:26:51
9025,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,"Liam, why did you talk to our boss about the project without including me?",2024-09-03 21:11:56
9026,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"Sarah, I didn't think it was necessary to involve you in every little detail.",2024-09-03 21:14:56
9027,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,But it’s a team project. We’re supposed to make decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:20:56
9028,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"I get that, but the boss just wanted a quick update. It wasn’t a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:21:56
9029,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,It feels like you're undermining my role in the team.,2024-09-03 21:30:56
9030,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,I didn't mean to make you feel that way. I was just trying to be efficient.,2024-09-03 21:39:56
9031,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,"Efficiency is important, but so is collaboration and trust.",2024-09-03 21:44:56
9032,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"You’re right, we need to have both. How can we avoid this in the future?",2024-09-03 21:49:56
9033,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,Maybe we should set up a protocol for all communications with the boss.,2024-09-03 21:56:56
9034,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"Sounds fair. We could agree on key points beforehand, so we’re both on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:57:56
9035,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,That would definitely help. And let's make sure we cc each other on all emails related to the project.,2024-09-03 21:59:56
9036,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll also make a point to loop you in for any impromptu updates.,2024-09-03 22:04:56
9037,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_1,"Thanks, Liam. I appreciate your understanding.",2024-09-03 22:11:56
9038,deescalatory_conversation_14,speaker_2,"No problem, Sarah. Let's move forward with stronger teamwork.",2024-09-03 22:17:56
9039,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,Why didn't you include my name in the article? We did the project together!,2024-09-03 21:19:01
9040,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,I didn't think you wanted credit for that specific part. You said you disliked working on the statistics.,2024-09-03 21:21:01
9041,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,"Yes, I said that, but it's still part of our collaboration. It makes it look like I didn't contribute at all.",2024-09-03 21:28:01
9042,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,I understand. That wasn't my intention. I thought it would be clear that we both worked on this.,2024-09-03 21:38:01
9043,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,"Well, it wasn't clear to the professor. She asked why I didn't do anything and it was embarrassing.",2024-09-03 21:45:01
9044,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,I'm really sorry about that. I should have checked with you before submitting the article. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:49:01
9045,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,I appreciate that. Maybe you could send a follow-up email to the professor explaining the oversight.,2024-09-03 21:59:01
9046,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll send it right now. I'll make sure to emphasize your key contributions.",2024-09-03 22:04:01
9047,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,"Thanks, that would really help. Can we also review the final drafts together in the future?",2024-09-03 22:09:01
9048,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,"Definitely, that's a good idea. We'll avoid misunderstandings and make sure we both get the credit we deserve.",2024-09-03 22:12:01
9049,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:16:01
9050,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,Thank you for bringing it up. Communication is key in any partnership.,2024-09-03 22:24:01
9051,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's move forward from this and finish strong.,2024-09-03 22:29:01
9052,deescalatory_conversation_15,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's make this our,2024-09-03 22:30:01
9053,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,We need to talk about yesterday's meeting.,2024-09-03 21:20:06
9054,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,"Yeah, I was going to bring that up. What happened?",2024-09-03 21:30:06
9055,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,You were really critical about my presentation in front of everyone.,2024-09-03 21:40:06
9056,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,I didn't mean to come off that way. I just had some concerns about the budget aspect.,2024-09-03 21:50:06
9057,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,"I understand, but it felt like an attack. It would have been better to discuss it privately.",2024-09-03 21:54:06
9058,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,"I'm sorry. You're right, I should have approached it differently.",2024-09-03 22:04:06
9059,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,Thank you. Maybe next time we can address concerns one-on-one before big meetings.,2024-09-03 22:11:06
9060,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I also want to make sure I fully understand your perspective before critiquing.,2024-09-03 22:14:06
9061,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,"That would definitely help. We both want the project to succeed, right?",2024-09-03 22:15:06
9062,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,Absolutely. And I know you're putting a lot of work into your part.,2024-09-03 22:19:06
9063,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's keep communication open and positive.,2024-09-03 22:23:06
9064,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_2,Agreed. How about we set a regular time to review each other's work?,2024-09-03 22:32:06
9065,deescalatory_conversation_16,speaker_1,Sounds good to me. Let's do that every Friday morning.,2024-09-03 22:37:06
9066,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,"Why did you turn in the group project without letting me see the final version first, Anna?",2024-09-03 21:13:09
9067,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,"I thought it was done and we were running out of time, Jordan. We needed to submit it before the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:14:09
9068,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,But we agreed to finalize it together. There were some key points I wanted to add!,2024-09-03 21:18:09
9069,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but I honestly believed we had everything covered. What points did you want to add?",2024-09-03 21:19:09
9070,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,We needed to elaborate more on the solutions section—specifically on the implementation plan. I had a few extra sources to include.,2024-09-03 21:26:09
9071,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,I see. Adding those points could have made a difference. Is there any way we can submit an updated version?,2024-09-03 21:32:09
9072,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,We could email the professor and explain. Maybe he'll allow a resubmission if it shows significant improvement.,2024-09-03 21:37:09
9073,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. I'll take responsibility and email him after class today.,2024-09-03 21:42:09
9074,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_1,"Thanks, Anna. Let's make sure we communicate better next time to avoid this kind of mistake.",2024-09-03 21:44:09
9075,deescalatory_conversation_17,speaker_2,Definitely. I'll keep you in the loop more closely moving forward.,2024-09-03 21:47:09
9076,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,"I don’t understand why you took the entire set of paintbrushes without asking, Liam.",2024-09-03 21:17:13
9077,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,"I needed them for my art project, Sarah. You weren’t using them at the time.",2024-09-03 21:18:13
9078,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,But I was planning to use them today. You didn’t think to check with me before just taking them?,2024-09-03 21:27:13
9079,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,I didn't think it would be a problem since you weren’t using them at the moment.,2024-09-03 21:28:13
9080,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,We need to start communicating better. I wouldn't have had an issue if you had simply asked me first.,2024-09-03 21:30:13
9081,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have asked. I just assumed it would be okay.",2024-09-03 21:35:13
9082,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,"Next time, can we make sure to check in with each other before taking shared supplies?",2024-09-03 21:39:13
9083,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,"Yes, let's do that. I think it will prevent misunderstandings like this in the future.",2024-09-03 21:46:13
9084,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,"Agreed. How is your art project going, by the way?",2024-09-03 21:47:13
9085,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,"It's coming along pretty well, thanks. How about yours?",2024-09-03 21:49:13
9086,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,It's getting there. Maybe we can set a schedule for using the supplies so we both get what we need?,2024-09-03 21:53:13
9087,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. Let’s figure out a schedule that works for both of us.,2024-09-03 21:57:13
9088,deescalatory_conversation_18,speaker_1,Perfect. I’m glad we talked this through.,2024-09-03 22:05:13
9089,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"You know, you can't just hog the controller all the time, Jake. We’re supposed to be playing together.",2024-09-03 21:11:18
9090,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"I get that, Mia, but I’m just better at this game. We’ll lose if you play.",2024-09-03 21:20:18
9091,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,It’s not about winning or losing; it’s about having fun together. We both deserve a turn.,2024-09-03 21:29:18
9092,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"Okay, but what if we lose because you don’t know the levels as well as I do?",2024-09-03 21:37:18
9093,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"Then we lose. It's a game, not a life-or-death situation. Plus, how am I supposed to get better if you never let me play?",2024-09-03 21:46:18
9094,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,That’s a fair point. I guess I’ve just been too focused on winning. But it's hard when losing makes the game less enjoyable for me.,2024-09-03 21:48:18
9095,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"I understand where you're coming from. Maybe we can take turns each level. You can give me tips as I play, and that might help us both enjoy it more.",2024-09-03 21:55:18
9096,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"That sounds like a good compromise. I’ll give you the controller after this level, and I’ll help out with any tips you need.",2024-09-03 22:03:18
9097,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"Perfect. And who knows, maybe we'll find out we make a good team if we combine our skills.",2024-09-03 22:10:18
9098,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_2,"Yeah, let’s give it a try. Thanks for pointing that out without getting angry, Mia.",2024-09-03 22:19:18
9099,deescalatory_conversation_19,speaker_1,"No problem, Jake.",2024-09-03 22:24:18
9100,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell us you were planning to reorganize the entire project timeline, Amy?",2024-09-03 21:20:22
9101,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was that big of a deal, Mark. We were falling behind, and I thought this would help us catch up.",2024-09-03 21:27:22
9102,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_3,But you didn't even ask for our input. We all have schedules and commitments.,2024-09-03 21:31:22
9103,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"I understand that, Jason. I just felt urgency was needed. Can we talk about the changes and see if they work for everyone?",2024-09-03 21:32:22
9104,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,We could have if you'd consulted us first. Now we're scrambling to rearrange everything.,2024-09-03 21:39:22
9105,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"That wasn't my intention. I was trying to help, not create more chaos.",2024-09-03 21:43:22
9106,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_3,"We get that you were trying to help, but collaboration is key. How about we review the changes together now?",2024-09-03 21:44:22
9107,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,"Sure, let's do that. Maybe some of my suggestions can be adjusted to fit everyone's needs.",2024-09-03 21:53:22
9108,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_1,"Fine, let's pull up the revised timeline and go through it step by step.",2024-09-03 22:03:22
9109,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_3,"Sounds good. And in the future, let's make sure major changes are discussed as a team first, okay?",2024-09-03 22:12:22
9110,deescalatory_conversation_20,speaker_2,Agreed. I apologize for not doing that this time. Let's fix this together.,2024-09-03 22:20:22
9111,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,We've got to talk about what happened during the group project presentation.,2024-09-03 21:18:26
9112,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,What's the issue? I thought everything went fine.,2024-09-03 21:24:26
9113,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,"Well, not really. You kind of took over the entire presentation without giving anyone else a chance to speak.",2024-09-03 21:25:26
9114,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_3,"Yeah, I spent a lot of time preparing my part, but I didn’t get to present it.",2024-09-03 21:33:26
9115,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,I didn’t mean to take over. I just thought it was better for the flow if one person handled it.,2024-09-03 21:35:26
9116,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,But we had agreed that we’d each present our own sections. It felt like you didn’t trust us to do our parts.,2024-09-03 21:39:26
9117,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_3,It’s not just about trust. I was really looking forward to presenting my research. I felt sidelined.,2024-09-03 21:45:26
9118,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,"I get that, but I was trying to make sure everything went smoothly. Maybe I overstepped.",2024-09-03 21:52:26
9119,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,"We appreciate wanting things to go smoothly, but collaboration is key. How can we handle it better next time?",2024-09-03 21:57:26
9120,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_3,Maybe we can have a timed rehearsal beforehand to make sure everyone gets their turn.,2024-09-03 22:02:26
9121,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,"That sounds fair. I apologize for taking over, and I’ll make sure to stick to the plan next time.",2024-09-03 22:04:26
9122,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. We all just want to contribute and make sure our work is recognized.,2024-09-03 22:08:26
9123,deescalatory_conversation_21,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let’s learn from this and do even better,2024-09-03 22:13:26
9124,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the group project meeting, Alex. We really needed your input.",2024-09-03 21:19:30
9125,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,"Sorry, Mark. I had a family emergency. I should've told you guys beforehand.",2024-09-03 21:23:30
9126,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_3,"We understand emergencies happen, but this is the third time. We need clarity and commitment from everyone.",2024-09-03 21:27:30
9127,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"Exactly, Sophia. We've been working hard to keep everything on track, but we can't keep covering for you, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:34:30
9128,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,"I get that, and I really appreciate the effort you both put in. What can I do now to help make up for it?",2024-09-03 21:38:30
9129,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_3,"Well, we have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow. Can you take the lead on the presentation slides? We need someone to make them look professional.",2024-09-03 21:43:30
9130,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,"Sure, I can handle that. I'll start working on them tonight and share a draft by morning.",2024-09-03 21:49:30
9131,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,"That sounds good. And just to ensure smoother coordination, could you also update us more frequently about your progress?",2024-09-03 21:53:30
9132,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll check in every day to provide updates and make sure we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:00:30
9133,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_3,"Thanks for stepping up, Alex. We need to rely on each other to make this project a success.",2024-09-03 22:10:30
9134,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_2,I appreciate the second chance. I'll make sure not to let you down again. Let's ace this project together.,2024-09-03 22:14:30
9135,deescalatory_conversation_22,speaker_1,Agreed. If any issues come up,2024-09-03 22:16:30
9136,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you missed practice yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:20:34
9137,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,I thought you knew. I had a family emergency.,2024-09-03 21:30:34
9138,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"I had no idea. Coach was really mad, you know?",2024-09-03 21:35:34
9139,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,I'm sorry. It was really sudden. I should have texted you.,2024-09-03 21:36:34
9140,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"Yeah, a heads up would have helped. We had to rearrange the drills because of it.",2024-09-03 21:40:34
9141,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,I get that. I'll make sure to let you know next time something comes up.,2024-09-03 21:47:34
9142,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,Thanks. Just a quick message is all it takes.,2024-09-03 21:53:34
9143,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,"I appreciate you understanding. Was practice okay, though?",2024-09-03 21:55:34
9144,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"It was tough, but we managed. Coach changed the formations last minute.",2024-09-03 22:00:34
9145,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,I'll catch up on what I missed. Can you fill me in later?,2024-09-03 22:02:34
9146,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"Sure, let's go over it after school. The new formations are tricky.",2024-09-03 22:11:34
9147,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,That sounds good. I really don't want to fall behind.,2024-09-03 22:17:34
9148,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,"Don't worry, I'll help you out. We need to stick together.",2024-09-03 22:20:34
9149,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for being supportive.,2024-09-03 22:22:34
9150,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,No problem. Just keep everyone in the loop next time.,2024-09-03 22:32:34
9151,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,Will do. I'm really grateful for your understanding.,2024-09-03 22:34:34
9152,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_1,We're teammates. We've got each other's backs.,2024-09-03 22:42:34
9153,deescalatory_conversation_23,speaker_2,"Exactly. Alright, let's focus on the next game",2024-09-03 22:49:34
9154,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were going to use my design for the project?,2024-09-03 21:20:37
9155,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal since we're working as a team.,2024-09-03 21:22:37
9156,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,"But it's my original work, and you didn't even ask for permission.",2024-09-03 21:27:37
9157,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I should have talked to you about it first.",2024-09-03 21:29:37
9158,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,We need to establish clear communication from now on.,2024-09-03 21:34:37
9159,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's set some guidelines so this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 21:36:37
9160,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,How about we always check in with each other before using each other's work?,2024-09-03 21:39:37
9161,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,"That sounds fair. And we should share our progress more frequently, too.",2024-09-03 21:42:37
9162,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,Good idea. Regular updates will help avoid misunderstandings like this.,2024-09-03 21:45:37
9163,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,I'm really sorry for not considering your feelings earlier.,2024-09-03 21:49:37
9164,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,It's okay. Let's focus on finishing this project successfully.,2024-09-03 21:50:37
9165,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,Absolutely. We make a great team when we're on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:52:37
9166,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_1,Definitely. Let's get back to work and make this project the best it can be.,2024-09-03 21:54:37
9167,deescalatory_conversation_24,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 21:55:37
9168,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,Why did you send that email to the client without discussing it with us first?,2024-09-03 21:13:43
9169,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,I thought it was urgent and didn't want to waste any time.,2024-09-03 21:21:43
9170,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,But we had agreed to make decisions as a team. This way everyone gets to weigh in.,2024-09-03 21:23:43
9171,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_3,"Yeah, it feels like you didn't trust us to handle it together.",2024-09-03 21:29:43
9172,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,I see what you mean. I didn't mean to undermine our team. I just felt pressured by the deadline.,2024-09-03 21:31:43
9173,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,"We understand the pressure, but it's crucial that we communicate, especially under tight deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:36:43
9174,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_3,"Maybe next time, if something feels urgent, you can drop a quick message in our group chat?",2024-09-03 21:46:43
9175,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I should have considered that. I'm really sorry for not involving you all.,2024-09-03 21:48:43
9176,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let's focus on fixing any issues with the email now.,2024-09-03 21:51:43
9177,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I'll forward the email to you both, and we can review it together.",2024-09-03 21:55:43
9178,deescalatory_conversation_25,speaker_3,Perfect. Thanks for being open to discussing this.,2024-09-03 21:58:43
9179,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you tell me you were planning to switch our project topic, John?",2024-09-03 21:20:48
9180,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"I thought you’d be okay with it since you didn’t seem too interested in the original topic, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:30:48
9181,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,But we agreed on that topic together. You changing it without asking first makes it feel like my opinion doesn't matter.,2024-09-03 21:40:48
9182,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,I didn’t mean to make it seem that way. I just found it really hard to find information on the original topic.,2024-09-03 21:46:48
9183,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,"I get that it might’ve been challenging, but we could’ve discussed it together and come up with a solution.",2024-09-03 21:52:48
9184,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"You’re right, I should have talked to you first. Maybe we can brainstorm a way to combine elements of both topics?",2024-09-03 21:58:48
9185,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I actually have a few ideas that might make the new direction more interesting for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:02:48
9186,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,Great! Let’s hear them. I’m open to anything that will make this project better.,2024-09-03 22:12:48
9187,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,"Okay, so what if we focused on how new technologies can solve some of the problems from our original topic?",2024-09-03 22:20:48
9188,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,That sounds really interesting. Let’s start with that and see how we can structure the project.,2024-09-03 22:23:48
9189,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_1,Perfect. I’ll jot down some key points we can use and then we can divide the research.,2024-09-03 22:24:48
9190,deescalatory_conversation_26,speaker_2,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate you being understanding. Let’s make this",2024-09-03 22:28:48
9191,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,"Why did you borrow my notes without asking, Anna? I needed them for my project!",2024-09-03 21:19:52
9192,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Tom. I didn't think it would be a big deal. I just needed to cross-check a few things.",2024-09-03 21:23:52
9193,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,But it was a big deal for me! I had to redo some work because I couldn't find them.,2024-09-03 21:28:52
9194,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,I understand that now. I should've asked first. Can we figure out a way to avoid this in the future?,2024-09-03 21:38:52
9195,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,I guess we could set up a system where we always ask before taking each other's stuff. Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 21:45:52
9196,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,"Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I'll make sure to follow that.",2024-09-03 21:55:52
9197,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,"And maybe we can share a digital copy of our notes, so we both have access whenever we need them.",2024-09-03 21:59:52
9198,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,"Great idea, Tom. I'll start scanning my notes tonight. Thanks for being understanding.",2024-09-03 22:07:52
9199,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_1,"I appreciate you being open to finding a solution, Anna. Let's move forward and finish our project strong.",2024-09-03 22:08:52
9200,deescalatory_conversation_27,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's do that. We make a good team when we communicate well.",2024-09-03 22:09:52
9201,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"Why did you skip practice again, Jake? The team is counting on you.",2024-09-03 21:11:56
9202,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework to do, Maria. I couldn't find the time.",2024-09-03 21:19:56
9203,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"We all have homework, but we still manage to come to practice. What's really going on?",2024-09-03 21:24:56
9204,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"I just feel like I'm not improving, and it's frustrating.",2024-09-03 21:25:56
9205,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"I get that it can be tough when you don't see immediate progress, but that's exactly why you need to keep practicing.",2024-09-03 21:35:56
9206,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"But it feels like no matter how hard I try, I'm not getting any better. It's embarrassing.",2024-09-03 21:40:56
9207,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,Everyone goes through rough patches. Have you thought about talking to Coach about it?,2024-09-03 21:44:56
9208,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"No, I haven't. I guess I was worried he might think I'm making excuses.",2024-09-03 21:48:56
9209,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"Coach is here to help all of us improve. If you let him know what you're struggling with, he can give you personalized tips.",2024-09-03 21:58:56
9210,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,Do you really think he would do that for me?,2024-09-03 22:06:56
9211,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,"Absolutely. He wants us all to succeed. Plus, the team needs you, Jake. You're an important part of our defense.",2024-09-03 22:16:56
9212,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_2,"Thanks, Maria. Maybe I'll give it another shot and talk to Coach.",2024-09-03 22:18:56
9213,deescalatory_conversation_28,speaker_1,I'm sure you'll feel better once you do. Let's push through this together.,2024-09-03 22:28:56
9214,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,"I can't believe you ditched the study group again, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:19:00
9215,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"I had other things to do, Eric. It's not the end of the world.",2024-09-03 21:20:00
9216,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,We're supposed to be a team. You committed to this project.,2024-09-03 21:26:00
9217,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Look, I've just had a lot on my plate lately.",2024-09-03 21:28:00
9218,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,"Guys, we need to figure this out. We're falling behind on the project timeline.",2024-09-03 21:37:00
9219,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,"Exactly! If Alex keeps missing the sessions, we'll never finish.",2024-09-03 21:44:00
9220,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Fine, I get it. What do you want me to do about it now?",2024-09-03 21:46:00
9221,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,"Let's just focus on moving forward. Alex, can you commit to the next meeting?",2024-09-03 21:47:00
9222,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can do that.",2024-09-03 21:53:00
9223,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,And can you actually prepare this time?,2024-09-03 22:00:00
9224,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Yes, I'll be prepared. What do we need to cover next?",2024-09-03 22:10:00
9225,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,"We need to finalize the research section. Can you handle the literature review, Alex?",2024-09-03 22:18:00
9226,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Sure, I can manage that.",2024-09-03 22:23:00
9227,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_1,"Great. Let's share our progress in the group chat before the next meet, okay?",2024-09-03 22:33:00
9228,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's keep open communication to avoid any more issues.,2024-09-03 22:36:00
9229,deescalatory_conversation_29,speaker_2,"Okay, I will. Sorry for the trouble, guys.",2024-09-03 22:39:00
9230,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up for the group project meeting last night.,2024-09-03 21:20:04
9231,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, there was a family emergency I had to attend to. I should have let you all know.",2024-09-03 21:21:04
9232,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_3,It's not the first time this has happened. We can't keep covering for you.,2024-09-03 21:30:04
9233,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,"I understand, and you're right. I need to be more reliable. Can we figure out a way to move forward from here?",2024-09-03 21:40:04
9234,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,We need to make sure all parts of the presentation are covered. Can you work on the data analysis tonight?,2024-09-03 21:49:04
9235,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I can finish the data analysis and send it to you all by tomorrow morning.",2024-09-03 21:50:04
9236,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_3,And let’s set up a reminder system so we all stay on track. We can't afford any more missed meetings.,2024-09-03 21:54:04
9237,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,Great idea. We could use a shared calendar.,2024-09-03 22:02:04
9238,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,I agree. I'll make sure to be more communicative and reliable. Thanks for giving me another chance.,2024-09-03 22:12:04
9239,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_3,"It's okay, let's just focus on getting this project done.",2024-09-03 22:20:04
9240,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's all check in daily until the presentation.,2024-09-03 22:23:04
9241,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_2,Sounds good to me. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:25:04
9242,deescalatory_conversation_30,speaker_3,"Alright, let's get back to work. We can still make this a great project.",2024-09-03 22:35:04
9243,deescalatory_conversation_31,scenario,Siblings arguing about chores not getting done in their shared apartment.,2024-09-03 21:13:07
9244,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,"You promised you'd clean the kitchen yesterday, and it's still a mess!",2024-09-03 21:23:07
9245,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,"Yeah, but I had a super stressful day. Can't you cut me some slack?",2024-09-03 21:26:07
9246,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,I've been cutting you slack all week. It's getting really frustrating!,2024-09-03 21:36:07
9247,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. I should've at least told you I'd be late on it.",2024-09-03 21:43:07
9248,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,Maybe we need to figure out a better chore schedule?,2024-09-03 21:51:07
9249,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,That sounds fair. How about we both sit down and plan it out together?,2024-09-03 21:59:07
9250,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,"Alright, let's do that after dinner. We can make sure we both know what's expected.",2024-09-03 22:03:07
9251,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,"Deal. And I'll clean the kitchen tonight, I promise.",2024-09-03 22:13:07
9252,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate that. Let's just communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:21:07
9253,deescalatory_conversation_31,speaker_2,Agreed. I don't want us to keep fighting over this.,2024-09-03 22:31:07
9254,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back and took credit for my ideas in the meeting, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:20:09
9255,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"I didn’t see it that way, John. I thought we were contributing as a team.",2024-09-03 21:21:09
9256,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,But you didn’t even mention my name or give me any credit.,2024-09-03 21:30:09
9257,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"I’m sorry, John. That wasn’t my intention at all. Can we talk about how we can better handle it next time?",2024-09-03 21:36:09
9258,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,I guess. I just felt really overlooked. How do you think we can make sure this doesn’t happen again?,2024-09-03 21:39:09
9259,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,How about we make it a point to highlight each other’s contributions in our reports?,2024-09-03 21:43:09
9260,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,"That sounds fair. And can we set some guidelines before we present, so we’re both on the same page?",2024-09-03 21:52:09
9261,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,"Absolutely, John. I want us both to succeed and get recognition for our work.",2024-09-03 21:57:09
9262,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate that. Let’s make sure we stay coordinated from now on.",2024-09-03 22:01:09
9263,deescalatory_conversation_32,speaker_2,Agreed. Communication is key. We’ll do better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:07:09
9264,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went through my stuff without asking, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:13:13
9265,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"I was just looking for my charger, Jake. It's not a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:15:13
9266,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,It is to me! My room is my private space.,2024-09-03 21:20:13
9267,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Okay, I get that. But you always borrow my things without asking.",2024-09-03 21:26:13
9268,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,"Maybe, but I usually ask at some point. You didn't even tell me you were looking for it.",2024-09-03 21:32:13
9269,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Alright, I see your point. How about this—next time I need something, I’ll text you first.",2024-09-03 21:40:13
9270,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,"That would be better. And if I'm not around, at least leave a note or something.",2024-09-03 21:48:13
9271,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,Deal. And can we agree that you'll do the same with my stuff?,2024-09-03 21:52:13
9272,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,"Yeah, I can do that. It's only fair.",2024-09-03 22:00:13
9273,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,"Thanks, Jake. I appreciate you understanding.",2024-09-03 22:04:13
9274,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,"No problem, Sarah. Communication is key, I guess.",2024-09-03 22:06:13
9275,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's try to be more mindful from now on.,2024-09-03 22:16:13
9276,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_1,Agreed. This wasn't worth arguing about in the first place.,2024-09-03 22:22:13
9277,deescalatory_conversation_33,speaker_2,True. I'm glad we talked it out.,2024-09-03 22:27:13
9278,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the project without consulting me, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:18:16
9279,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,"I had to, John. The deadline was approaching, and you were unreachable.",2024-09-03 21:25:16
9280,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,I was dealing with a family emergency. You knew that.,2024-09-03 21:27:16
9281,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I should have taken that into account. But I didn't want us to miss the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:28:16
9282,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,But now the project isn't at its best because you didn't include my input.,2024-09-03 21:36:16
9283,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,You're right. It could have been better with your feedback. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:40:16
9284,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,Maybe we can ask for a revision opportunity from our supervisor and present a stronger version.,2024-09-03 21:49:16
9285,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,That sounds reasonable. Let’s draft an email together explaining the situation.,2024-09-03 21:58:16
9286,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,Agreed. How about we meet after lunch to work on it?,2024-09-03 22:07:16
9287,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_2,Perfect. Let's make sure we avoid these kinds of issues in the future by improving our communication.,2024-09-03 22:13:16
9288,deescalatory_conversation_34,speaker_1,"Definitely. I'll make sure I'm more reachable, and you can give me a heads up if deadlines are tight.",2024-09-03 22:21:16
9289,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"I don't get why you keep redoing my part of the project, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:17:20
9290,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"Because, Alex, it's not matching the guidelines Professor Jones gave us.",2024-09-03 21:22:20
9291,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,But I followed the guideline document exactly. Did you even look at my work closely?,2024-09-03 21:30:20
9292,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,"Hey, let's take a step back. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.",2024-09-03 21:34:20
9293,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"I'm sorry if it seems like I'm dismissing your effort, Alex. I'm just stressed about our deadline.",2024-09-03 21:39:20
9294,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"I get that, but redoing my work without talking to me first feels disrespectful.",2024-09-03 21:47:20
9295,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,How about we go over the guidelines together and compare them with Alex's part?,2024-09-03 21:52:20
9296,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"That sounds fair. Alex, can you share your document again?",2024-09-03 21:58:20
9297,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"Sure, here it is. You'll see I included all the sections Professor Jones mentioned.",2024-09-03 21:59:20
9298,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,"I see. It looks like the content is there, though maybe the formatting could match the rest of our project better.",2024-09-03 22:07:20
9299,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,"I didn't catch that initially. The content is good, Alex. Maybe we just need to format it consistently.",2024-09-03 22:09:20
9300,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_1,"Okay, if formatting was the issue, I'd have appreciated if you told me. I can fix that.",2024-09-03 22:19:20
9301,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_2,Sorry for not communicating better. Let’s make sure we're on the same page before making changes next time.,2024-09-03 22:26:20
9302,deescalatory_conversation_35,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's focus on finishing this project strong,2024-09-03 22:27:20
9303,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,"You always leave your dirty dishes in the sink, and I'm tired of cleaning up after you.",2024-09-03 21:14:23
9304,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,I don't understand why it's such a big deal. I'll get to them eventually.,2024-09-03 21:20:23
9305,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,"It is a big deal because it's a shared space, and it's about respect for each other.",2024-09-03 21:25:23
9306,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,"I get that, but sometimes I just forget. Can we put a system in place to remind me?",2024-09-03 21:30:23
9307,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,Maybe we could try setting a timer after meals as a reminder?,2024-09-03 21:37:23
9308,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,That sounds reasonable. I'll give it a shot. Anything else bothering you?,2024-09-03 21:46:23
9309,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,"If we could also tidy up the living room on weekends, that would help a lot.",2024-09-03 21:52:23
9310,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,"Sure, we can set aside some time on Saturdays for that. Thanks for bringing this up calmly.",2024-09-03 21:58:23
9311,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_1,I appreciate you being open to finding solutions. Let's stick to this plan and see how it goes.,2024-09-03 22:03:23
9312,deescalatory_conversation_36,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's check in next week to see if it's working.,2024-09-03 22:08:23
9313,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you failed the math test?,2024-09-03 21:17:26
9314,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,"I was going to, but I didn't want to disappoint you.",2024-09-03 21:26:26
9315,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,It's more disappointing to find out from your teacher. Why keep it a secret?,2024-09-03 21:36:26
9316,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,I thought I could fix it on my own without worrying you.,2024-09-03 21:45:26
9317,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, but we need to be honest with each other. How can I help if I don't know there's a problem?",2024-09-03 21:51:26
9318,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,I guess you're right. I just didn't want to add to your stress.,2024-09-03 22:01:26
9319,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,We're a team. Your struggles are my struggles. Let's work through this together.,2024-09-03 22:08:26
9320,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,"Okay, I promise I'll come to you next time. Can we go over the material together?",2024-09-03 22:17:26
9321,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,Absolutely. We'll start tonight. Thank you for opening up.,2024-09-03 22:19:26
9322,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. I'm feeling better already.,2024-09-03 22:28:26
9323,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_1,We're in this together. We'll get through it and make a plan for your next test.,2024-09-03 22:35:26
9324,deescalatory_conversation_37,speaker_2,Sounds good. Let's do this.,2024-09-03 22:42:26
9325,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball back in the last quarter, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:20:29
9326,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, Max. I thought the shot was clear.",2024-09-03 21:25:29
9327,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,But I was waving my hand right in front of you!,2024-09-03 21:26:29
9328,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I was just trying to focus on the hoop.,2024-09-03 21:35:29
9329,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_3,"Guys, we're all trying to win here. Let's figure out how we can improve and avoid this next game.",2024-09-03 21:39:29
9330,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,"Fine, but it keeps happening. We need better communication on the court.",2024-09-03 21:41:29
9331,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,Agreed. Maybe we should call out loud when we're open.,2024-09-03 21:46:29
9332,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,"That could work. Also, let's trust each other more with those passes.",2024-09-03 21:48:29
9333,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,"Definitely. I promise to keep an eye out for you, Max.",2024-09-03 21:50:29
9334,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_3,"Alright, it sounds like we have a plan. Now, let's just get back to practice and work on our plays.",2024-09-03 21:55:29
9335,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_1,"Thanks, team. We got this.",2024-09-03 21:59:29
9336,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_2,"Yeah, we do. Let's do it!",2024-09-03 22:02:29
9337,deescalatory_conversation_38,speaker_3,"Break on three! One, two, three!",2024-09-03 22:05:29
9338,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,"Why didn't you finish the project, Mark? We were supposed to submit it today!",2024-09-03 21:21:32
9339,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,"I know, Emily. I'm really sorry. My laptop crashed, and I lost all the work I had done.",2024-09-03 21:24:32
9340,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,You could have told me sooner! We might've been able to come up with a solution together.,2024-09-03 21:31:32
9341,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,You're right. I was so stressed about it that I didn't think straight. What can we do now?,2024-09-03 21:33:32
9342,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,Maybe we can ask the professor for a brief extension and work on it together tonight.,2024-09-03 21:41:32
9343,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I'll send an email to the professor right now. Will you be able to meet up later?,2024-09-03 21:47:32
9344,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,"Yes, I can. Let me know what the professor says, and we'll figure out a plan from there.",2024-09-03 21:50:32
9345,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,"Thank you for being understanding, Emily. I promise I'll make it up to you.",2024-09-03 21:59:32
9346,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, Mark. Let's just focus on getting this project done.",2024-09-03 22:01:32
9347,deescalatory_conversation_39,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I'll get on that email immediately. Thank you, Emily.",2024-09-03 22:09:32
9348,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,Can we talk about what happened during the group project presentation?,2024-09-03 21:20:36
9349,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,"Yeah, I guess. What’s bothering you?",2024-09-03 21:26:36
9350,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,I felt like you didn’t give me a chance to speak at all.,2024-09-03 21:31:36
9351,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,"I noticed that too. It seemed like you took over the whole presentation, speaker_2.",2024-09-03 21:40:36
9352,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,I didn't mean to. I just thought we were running out of time and needed to cover everything.,2024-09-03 21:48:36
9353,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,"I understand that, but it would have been better if we all had a part in presenting. We practiced this, remember?",2024-09-03 21:50:36
9354,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,We spent time dividing the sections. It felt unfair to not stick to the plan.,2024-09-03 21:57:36
9355,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,"Okay, I can see how that was frustrating. Maybe we should have coordinated better on the time management.",2024-09-03 22:01:36
9356,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,"Exactly. We can’t change what happened, but we can learn from it. How can we make sure this doesn’t happen again?",2024-09-03 22:05:36
9357,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,Maybe we should assign a timekeeper for next time to ensure everyone gets their turn.,2024-09-03 22:12:36
9358,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,That’s a good idea. I’m really sorry if I took over. I just got caught up in trying to complete everything.,2024-09-03 22:18:36
9359,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let’s make sure to communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:20:36
9360,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_3,Agreed. I think this will help our future projects go smoother.,2024-09-03 22:26:36
9361,deescalatory_conversation_40,speaker_2,"Thanks, everyone. I appreciate",2024-09-03 22:32:36
9362,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,I don't understand why you submitted that project without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:13:40
9363,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,I thought we agreed on the concept last week. I didn’t realize further consultation was needed.,2024-09-03 21:15:40
9364,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,"We agreed on the concept, yes, but there were still details to finalize.",2024-09-03 21:16:40
9365,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,I see your point. What parts did you feel needed more discussion?,2024-09-03 21:21:40
9366,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,"The budget and timeline, mostly. I was concerned about overshooting both.",2024-09-03 21:23:40
9367,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,"Okay, I get it now. Maybe we can review those details together and make necessary adjustments?",2024-09-03 21:27:40
9368,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. Let’s set up a meeting to go over everything.,2024-09-03 21:37:40
9369,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,How about tomorrow afternoon? Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 21:39:40
9370,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,Tomorrow afternoon works. I’ll prepare the notes I have on the budget and timeline.,2024-09-03 21:44:40
9371,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,"Perfect. I’ll bring my notes too, and we can iron out any inconsistencies.",2024-09-03 21:47:40
9372,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,"Great, I’m glad we’re on the same page now.",2024-09-03 21:57:40
9373,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,Me too. Let’s make sure this project hits all the right marks.,2024-09-03 21:59:40
9374,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_1,Absolutely. Thanks for being open to discussing this.,2024-09-03 22:02:40
9375,deescalatory_conversation_41,speaker_2,No problem. Teamwork is all about communication.,2024-09-03 22:07:40
9376,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:20:46
9377,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,I sent a message saying I couldn't make it. Didn't you see it?,2024-09-03 21:29:46
9378,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,"No, I didn't see any message. We needed your input, and now we're behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:30:46
9379,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,"I understand, but I had an emergency. Can we find a way to catch up?",2024-09-03 21:34:46
9380,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,What kind of emergency? You could've tried harder to let us know.,2024-09-03 21:35:46
9381,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,"My sister was in the hospital, and I had to be with her. I'm sorry if it messed things up.",2024-09-03 21:37:46
9382,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. I didn't realize it was something so serious.,2024-09-03 21:45:46
9383,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,"Thanks. Can you fill me in on what I missed, so I can help get us back on track?",2024-09-03 21:54:46
9384,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,"Sure. We divided the tasks, but we're struggling with the design part. Can you handle that?",2024-09-03 22:00:46
9385,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll work on the design tonight and update you all by tomorrow morning.,2024-09-03 22:09:46
9386,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,That would be great. Let's aim to have a draft ready by the end of the week.,2024-09-03 22:17:46
9387,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to communicate better moving forward. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:26:46
9388,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_1,"No problem. We're a team, and we all want to succeed. Let's just keep each other in the loop.",2024-09-03 22:29:46
9389,deescalatory_conversation_42,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's get this project done and make,2024-09-03 22:34:46
9390,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,"Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:20:49
9391,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"I didn't realize it was such a big deal, Josh. It was just a piece of cake.",2024-09-03 21:22:49
9392,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,It’s not just about the cake. It’s about respecting each other's stuff in the house.,2024-09-03 21:31:49
9393,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"I get that, but you never mentioned you wanted the last piece. How was I supposed to know?",2024-09-03 21:33:49
9394,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,Maybe you could have asked if anyone else wanted it before taking it.,2024-09-03 21:43:49
9395,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. Next time, I'll make sure to ask first.",2024-09-03 21:47:49
9396,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,"Thanks, that would be great. We all share this space, so communicating is important.",2024-09-03 21:57:49
9397,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,Totally agree. Sorry for not considering how you felt about it.,2024-09-03 22:06:49
9398,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,It’s alright. Let’s just try to be more mindful in the future.,2024-09-03 22:14:49
9399,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Moving forward, I'll definitely check in before taking the last of anything.",2024-09-03 22:22:49
9400,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,And I’ll make sure to communicate better if something is important to me.,2024-09-03 22:23:49
9401,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan. Let's make this work better for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:29:49
9402,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_1,"Definitely. Thanks for understanding, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:36:49
9403,deescalatory_conversation_43,speaker_2,"No problem, Josh. I appreciate you bringing it up calmly.",2024-09-03 22:44:49
9404,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_1,"Why did you take all the credit for our group project, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:15:51
9405,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Jamie? I did a lot of work on it.",2024-09-03 21:25:51
9406,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_1,"I know you did, but you didn't mention any of our contributions during the presentation.",2024-09-03 21:29:51
9407,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,I didn't realize it came off that way. I was just trying to summarize everything quickly.,2024-09-03 21:32:51
9408,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_3,"Alex, it really sounded like you did everything. We all put in a lot of effort.",2024-09-03 21:34:51
9409,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,I understand that now. I’m sorry if it seemed like I was overshadowing everyone else’s work.,2024-09-03 21:37:51
9410,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_1,Can we make sure to acknowledge everyone’s parts if we work together again?,2024-09-03 21:39:51
9411,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Jamie. Next time, we’ll make sure everyone is properly credited.",2024-09-03 21:49:51
9412,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_3,"Thanks, Alex. And let’s also be more careful with communication, so we don’t have misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 21:59:51
9413,deescalatory_conversation_44,speaker_2,"Agreed, Sam. Communication is key.",2024-09-03 22:07:51
9414,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the group project without checking with us first.,2024-09-03 21:21:54
9415,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,"I had to, the deadline was closing in and no one else was taking the initiative.",2024-09-03 21:22:54
9416,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_3,But you didn't include some of the latest data I gathered. It's going to look incomplete.,2024-09-03 21:27:54
9417,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,"Exactly, it feels like all our work wasn't accounted for properly.",2024-09-03 21:28:54
9418,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,"I understand, but I did what I thought was best under the circumstances. We can still add the data in the final presentation.",2024-09-03 21:37:54
9419,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_3,"It's not just about the data, it's about making decisions without consulting the team.",2024-09-03 21:42:54
9420,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have communicated better. How about we go through the project now and make a list of what's missing?",2024-09-03 21:52:54
9421,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,That would help. We need to be on the same page from now on.,2024-09-03 21:53:54
9422,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's focus on fixing what's done rather than arguing about it. Can we start with my sections?,2024-09-03 22:01:54
9423,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,"Sure, let's review everything. I'll take notes to ensure we cover all aspects.",2024-09-03 22:10:54
9424,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,Sounds good. And let's establish a protocol for decisions in the future. Maybe regular check-ins?,2024-09-03 22:11:54
9425,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_3,"Yes, and let's be respectful of each other's contributions and make sure everyone has a say.",2024-09-03 22:17:54
9426,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_2,Thank you for understanding. Let's start reviewing the work and make it the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:20:54
9427,deescalatory_conversation_45,speaker_1,"Great, let's get",2024-09-03 22:22:54
9428,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,I can't believe you just bailed on our group presentation today.,2024-09-03 21:20:57
9429,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,"I had an emergency, and I texted you as soon as I could. Did you get my message?",2024-09-03 21:24:57
9430,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,"Yes, but it was 10 minutes before we were supposed to go on! Do you know how unprepared I felt?",2024-09-03 21:32:57
9431,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,I'm really sorry about that. What exactly happened during the presentation?,2024-09-03 21:34:57
9432,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,I had to cover your part with no notice. I was stumbling and lost my place several times.,2024-09-03 21:36:57
9433,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,That must've been really stressful for you. Is there anything specific I can do to make it right?,2024-09-03 21:40:57
9434,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,I don't know. Maybe help me figure out how we can improve our grades from here?,2024-09-03 21:48:57
9435,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's set up a time to meet with the professor and explain what happened. Maybe we can do an extra project together to make up for the marks lost.,2024-09-03 21:57:57
9436,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,That could work. I'd feel better if we had a clear plan moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:06:57
9437,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,For sure. I'll draft an email to the professor tonight and send it to you before we send it out. How does that sound?,2024-09-03 22:07:57
9438,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,Sounds good. Thanks for being willing to work through this.,2024-09-03 22:08:57
9439,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_2,Of course. We need to get through this together. Let's also set up a few more practice sessions so we’re better prepared next time.,2024-09-03 22:11:57
9440,deescalatory_conversation_46,speaker_1,,2024-09-03 22:17:57
9441,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,Why did you use my design without asking me?,2024-09-03 21:14:59
9442,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,I thought it would be okay since we're working on the same project.,2024-09-03 21:21:59
9443,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"Well, it's not okay. You should have at least discussed it with me first.",2024-09-03 21:30:59
9444,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,I understand. I should have communicated better. Can we fix it together?,2024-09-03 21:39:59
9445,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. I just want us to collaborate properly.,2024-09-03 21:47:59
9446,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,"Right, so how about we set up a meeting to review both our designs?",2024-09-03 21:57:59
9447,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,"Yes, let's do that. When are you available?",2024-09-03 22:02:59
9448,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,Tomorrow afternoon works for me. How about you?,2024-09-03 22:05:59
9449,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,Tomorrow afternoon works. Let’s finalize our designs and make sure we’re on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:06:59
9450,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for being open to working it out.,2024-09-03 22:12:59
9451,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_1,No problem. Let's make this project great together.,2024-09-03 22:20:59
9452,deescalatory_conversation_47,speaker_2,Absolutely. See you tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:26:59
9453,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,You missed the rehearsal again! How are we supposed to perform well in the play if you keep skipping practice?,2024-09-03 21:14:02
9454,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, but I had an exam to study for. I didn't mean to let anyone down.",2024-09-03 21:24:02
9455,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,"We all have other commitments, but we still show up. The whole group is counting on you.",2024-09-03 21:31:02
9456,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"I understand that, and I’ll make sure to manage my time better. Is there a way I can catch up on what I missed?",2024-09-03 21:33:02
9457,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,We reviewed the choreography and some new lines. Maybe we can meet up before the next rehearsal to go through it together?,2024-09-03 21:40:02
9458,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,That sounds good. I’ll make the time. Thank you for being understanding.,2024-09-03 21:43:02
9459,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,"Just make sure it doesn’t happen again, alright? We’re a team, and we need everyone to be committed.",2024-09-03 21:52:02
9460,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I appreciate the chance to make it right. From now on, I’ll communicate better if something comes up.",2024-09-03 21:57:02
9461,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_1,"Great, let’s make this performance the best it can be by supporting each other.",2024-09-03 22:04:02
9462,deescalatory_conversation_48,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for being open to working this out.,2024-09-03 22:05:02
9463,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,"Why did you cancel our study group meeting without telling anyone, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:17:05
9464,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,I didn’t think it was a big deal. Everyone knows the material already.,2024-09-03 21:24:05
9465,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,It is a big deal. Some of us rely on these study groups to prepare for exams.,2024-09-03 21:25:05
9466,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_3,I agree with speaker_1. I was really counting on that session to go over the difficult chapters.,2024-09-03 21:35:05
9467,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"Well, there’s always next week. Why are you all making such a fuss?",2024-09-03 21:45:05
9468,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,"Because we’re a team. If one person decides to cancel without input, it affects us all.",2024-09-03 21:50:05
9469,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. But we all have the textbook and notes, do we really need to meet every week?",2024-09-03 21:52:05
9470,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_3,"Yes, we do. Group discussions help us learn better and address any gaps in our understanding.",2024-09-03 21:57:05
9471,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,"Alright, I understand. I didn’t realize it was that important to everyone. Next time, I’ll make sure to check with you all before making a decision.",2024-09-03 22:06:05
9472,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. We just want to make sure everyone has what they need to succeed.",2024-09-03 22:16:05
9473,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_3,"Yeah, we’re stronger when we work together. Your input matters, but so does everyone else's.",2024-09-03 22:17:05
9474,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_2,Got it. I’ll be more considerate. Let’s focus on how we can make our next session even more productive.,2024-09-03 22:26:05
9475,deescalatory_conversation_49,speaker_1,Great,2024-09-03 22:34:05
9476,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,I can't believe you went through my sketchbook without asking.,2024-09-03 21:15:07
9477,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"I was just curious, I didn't think it would bother you that much.",2024-09-03 21:18:07
9478,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,It's personal! You know how much those drawings mean to me.,2024-09-03 21:19:07
9479,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"I get it, but I didn't mean to invade your privacy. I just really like your art.",2024-09-03 21:21:07
9480,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"Still, you should have asked first. It's about respect.",2024-09-03 21:26:07
9481,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,You're right. I should have asked. I didn't think about it that way.,2024-09-03 21:27:07
9482,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,Thank you for understanding. It's just that some of those sketches are really personal to me.,2024-09-03 21:34:07
9483,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"I get it. From now on, I'll make sure to ask before going through your stuff.",2024-09-03 21:36:07
9484,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"Thanks, that means a lot. I appreciate you liking my art, though.",2024-09-03 21:44:07
9485,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"Your art is amazing, and I'm glad we can talk about this calmly.",2024-09-03 21:49:07
9486,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,"Me too. Friends respect each other's boundaries, right?",2024-09-03 21:52:07
9487,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I'll do better, I promise.",2024-09-03 21:55:07
9488,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's move past this. Want to grab some coffee?,2024-09-03 22:02:07
9489,deescalatory_conversation_50,speaker_2,"Sure, I'd love that!",2024-09-03 22:11:07
9490,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball during the game, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:15:10
9491,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"Mia, I didn't see you were open. The defense was really tight.",2024-09-03 21:25:10
9492,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"You've been ignoring my plays for the past few games, it's like you don't trust me.",2024-09-03 21:34:10
9493,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_3,Maybe this is something we should talk about as a team. We can't let misunderstandings affect our game.,2024-09-03 21:44:10
9494,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"I do trust you, Mia. Sometimes in the heat of the moment, decisions are rushed. It's not intentional.",2024-09-03 21:46:10
9495,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,It just feels like I'm being sidelined and my contributions aren't valued.,2024-09-03 21:47:10
9496,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_3,Let's focus on how we can improve our communication on the court. Maybe we need better signals or practice more.,2024-09-03 21:51:10
9497,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,"That's a good idea, Coach. Mia, I want you to know that your plays are valuable and I should work on noticing your position more.",2024-09-03 21:55:10
9498,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, Alex. Maybe we could go over some strategies together so we're on the same page during the game.",2024-09-03 22:01:10
9499,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's set up some extra practice sessions this week.,2024-09-03 22:11:10
9500,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_3,Great! I'm glad we could talk this out. We're all on the same team and we need to support each other to win.,2024-09-03 22:16:10
9501,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks for listening, guys. Looking forward to making those plays together.",2024-09-03 22:21:10
9502,deescalatory_conversation_51,speaker_2,Me too. Let's give it our best and make the next,2024-09-03 22:31:10
9503,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,"I'm really disappointed that you didn't show up for the group project meeting, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:21:13
9504,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"I know, Jamie. I'm really sorry. I had a family emergency.",2024-09-03 21:22:13
9505,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,"A family emergency? This has happened before. Why didn't you tell us earlier, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:31:13
9506,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"I should have told you, Sam. I just got overwhelmed and didn't manage my time well.",2024-09-03 21:36:13
9507,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,"Look, we all have things going on, but this project is important. We're all counting on each other.",2024-09-03 21:40:13
9508,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"You're right, Jamie. I need to be more reliable.",2024-09-03 21:44:13
9509,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,"Okay, so what can we do to move forward? We need your part done soon.",2024-09-03 21:50:13
9510,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,I can finish my part by tonight. Would that work?,2024-09-03 21:52:13
9511,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,That would help a lot. Let's just keep communication open from now on.,2024-09-03 21:55:13
9512,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,"Agreed. If something comes up, just let us know immediately.",2024-09-03 21:59:13
9513,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for understanding, guys. I'll get to work on my section right away.",2024-09-03 22:01:13
9514,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_1,Great. Let's aim to get this done together smoothly from now on.,2024-09-03 22:06:13
9515,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_3,Sounds good to me. We're all in this together.,2024-09-03 22:08:13
9516,deescalatory_conversation_52,speaker_2,"Definitely. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again. Thanks, Jamie and Sam.",2024-09-03 22:12:13
9517,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,Why did you take my notebook without asking?,2024-09-03 21:21:16
9518,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,I needed to copy the notes I missed from class last week.,2024-09-03 21:25:16
9519,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,But you could have asked me first. It's not cool to just take my stuff.,2024-09-03 21:35:16
9520,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have asked. I just didn't want to bother you since you were studying.",2024-09-03 21:36:16
9521,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,I would rather you interrupt me than go behind my back. It's about trust.,2024-09-03 21:37:16
9522,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,I understand. I won't do it again.,2024-09-03 21:38:16
9523,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,Thanks. Can we also figure out a better way for you to get the notes you need?,2024-09-03 21:40:16
9524,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Sure. Maybe we can set a specific time after class to go over what you learned?,2024-09-03 21:41:16
9525,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,"That works for me. Also, if you ever need my notes in a hurry, just send me a quick text.",2024-09-03 21:50:16
9526,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Good idea. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 21:57:16
9527,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_1,No problem. Just want to keep things smooth between us.,2024-09-03 22:01:16
9528,deescalatory_conversation_53,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's move on and focus on our studies.,2024-09-03 22:06:16
9529,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,I can't believe you used my design without asking me first.,2024-09-03 21:13:18
9530,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,I thought it was just a rough sketch. I didn't think you'd mind.,2024-09-03 21:23:18
9531,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,It wasn’t just a rough sketch. I've been working on it for weeks!,2024-09-03 21:26:18
9532,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I didn’t know it was that important to you. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:27:18
9533,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"Well, first, you need to acknowledge that what you did was wrong.",2024-09-03 21:33:18
9534,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,You're right. I should've asked for your permission before using it.,2024-09-03 21:40:18
9535,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,Thanks. We also need to make sure my design isn't presented as your own work.,2024-09-03 21:48:18
9536,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,Absolutely. Should we go talk to the project manager together?,2024-09-03 21:51:18
9537,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"Yes, that sounds good. And maybe next time we can set clearer boundaries about our individual contributions.",2024-09-03 21:55:18
9538,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,Agreed. I really value your creativity and don’t want to undermine your efforts.,2024-09-03 22:04:18
9539,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,Thanks for saying that. Let's make sure our work reflects both our ideas fairly.,2024-09-03 22:07:18
9540,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_2,Definitely. Can we start over and rework the presentation together?,2024-09-03 22:09:18
9541,deescalatory_conversation_54,speaker_1,"Yes, I'd like that. Let's make this project something we're both proud of.",2024-09-03 22:19:18
9542,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,Why did you send out the group project without consulting any of us?,2024-09-03 21:14:20
9543,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,I thought it was done and we were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:22:20
9544,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,"But you know we had more things to add, it's unfair to decide for everyone.",2024-09-03 21:28:20
9545,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_3,"Hey, let's not jump to conclusions. Can we talk about what was missed?",2024-09-03 21:35:20
9546,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,"We didn't include the analysis part, which was a key aspect.",2024-09-03 21:38:20
9547,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,I didn't realize it was that important. Can we add it in the final submission?,2024-09-03 21:41:20
9548,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,But the preliminary submission already went through. How do we address that?,2024-09-03 21:46:20
9549,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_3,Maybe we can explain to the professor that it was an oversight and seek permission for a small update.,2024-09-03 21:55:20
9550,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,I can draft an email to the professor explaining the situation. Does that work for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:03:20
9551,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,"That sounds better than arguing, but we need to agree on a process moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:07:20
9552,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's make sure we have a final review session for our next big project.,2024-09-03 22:08:20
9553,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_2,I’m on board with that. Sorry for the oversight. I'll coordinate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:13:20
9554,deescalatory_conversation_55,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. It's important we all stay on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:22:20
9555,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my presentation slides, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:15:22
9556,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"I didn't delete them on purpose, Jenna. I was trying to reorganize the folder and must have clicked the wrong file.",2024-09-03 21:20:22
9557,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,You should have been more careful! Those slides took me hours to make.,2024-09-03 21:24:22
9558,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"I understand that you're upset, and I’m really sorry. How can we fix this together?",2024-09-03 21:31:22
9559,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"I guess we could try to recreate the slides, but it’s going to take a lot of time.",2024-09-03 21:36:22
9560,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,I can stay late tonight and help you rebuild them. Will that work?,2024-09-03 21:42:22
9561,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,That’s fair. I’ll appreciate the help. Can you also double-check your files next time?,2024-09-03 21:43:22
9562,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll be more cautious in the future. Let's get started on rebuilding those slides now.",2024-09-03 21:50:22
9563,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_1,"Great, let’s do it. And thank you for being willing to help.",2024-09-03 21:57:22
9564,deescalatory_conversation_56,speaker_2,"No problem, Jenna. We're a team, after all.",2024-09-03 21:58:22
9565,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up for the project meeting today.,2024-09-03 21:15:24
9566,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"I know, I'm really sorry. Something urgent came up at home.",2024-09-03 21:18:24
9567,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,You could've at least sent a message to let us know.,2024-09-03 21:28:24
9568,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have communicated better. How can I make it up to the team?",2024-09-03 21:37:24
9569,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,"Well, we need your part of the research by tomorrow. Can you handle that?",2024-09-03 21:44:24
9570,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"Yes, I can work on it tonight and have it ready by tomorrow morning.",2024-09-03 21:46:24
9571,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_3,It would really help if you could also review the introduction to make sure it aligns with your findings.,2024-09-03 21:50:24
9572,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll review it as well and ensure everything is consistent.",2024-09-03 21:52:24
9573,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_1,Thanks for stepping up. Let's make sure we all stay in touch better moving forward.,2024-09-03 21:58:24
9574,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_2,Agreed. I'm setting a reminder to check in with you all more frequently.,2024-09-03 22:06:24
9575,deescalatory_conversation_57,speaker_3,"Sounds like a plan. This project is important to all of us, and I appreciate everyone's effort.",2024-09-03 22:15:24
9576,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass the ball to me during the game? We could have scored!,2024-09-03 21:19:26
9577,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,I didn't see you were open. I thought I had a better shot at the goal.,2024-09-03 21:27:26
9578,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,"But you missed! You keep doing this every game, and it's frustrating.",2024-09-03 21:31:26
9579,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,"I know, I'm sorry. I'm trying to make the best decisions, but it's tough under pressure.",2024-09-03 21:37:26
9580,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_3,"Hey, we all make mistakes. Let's figure out how to improve our communication on the field.",2024-09-03 21:41:26
9581,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,Maybe we need to call out more clearly when we're open. Sometimes I feel like nobody hears me.,2024-09-03 21:43:26
9582,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,That's a good point. I guess I should also keep my head up more instead of focusing solely on the ball.,2024-09-03 21:44:26
9583,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_3,We could practice this during our next training session—work on verbal signals and better teamwork.,2024-09-03 21:50:26
9584,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's try that. We really need to function better as a unit if we want to win.",2024-09-03 21:56:26
9585,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. I'll definitely be more aware next time.,2024-09-03 22:04:26
9586,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_3,"Okay, it's settled then. Let's put this behind us and focus on improving together.",2024-09-03 22:06:26
9587,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's get back to playing our best.,2024-09-03 22:14:26
9588,deescalatory_conversation_58,speaker_2,"Yeah, let's do this. We can turn things around!",2024-09-03 22:20:26
9589,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and bought that expensive equipment without consulting any of us.,2024-09-03 21:22:30
9590,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,The old equipment was holding us back. We needed this upgrade to stay competitive.,2024-09-03 21:28:30
9591,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_3,But using up nearly our entire budget? Now we're broke.,2024-09-03 21:35:30
9592,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,"I know it used a lot of our funds, but we can work things out. Let's figure out how to manage the rest of the expenses.",2024-09-03 21:44:30
9593,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,How are we supposed to trust you with decisions if you keep acting on your own?,2024-09-03 21:50:30
9594,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,I'm sorry for not including everyone in the decision. It won't happen again. Can we talk about making a plan moving forward?,2024-09-03 21:52:30
9595,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_3,"Fine, but we need to set some ground rules for future purchases. How about we agree that any expense over a certain amount needs a vote?",2024-09-03 21:57:30
9596,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. Can we agree on a cap of $500 for now?,2024-09-03 21:59:30
9597,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's also set up a monthly meeting to discuss any big decisions or upcoming needs.,2024-09-03 22:04:30
9598,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_3,"Good idea. This way, we can avoid misunderstandings and make sure everyone is on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:11:30
9599,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_1,"Okay, I feel better about this. Let's make sure we stick to the plan.",2024-09-03 22:15:30
9600,deescalatory_conversation_59,speaker_2,Definitely. I'm committed to getting our team back on track.,2024-09-03 22:24:30
9601,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,Why did you take my project idea and present it as your own?,2024-09-03 21:21:32
9602,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,I didn't realize you were so serious about it. I thought we could both work on it.,2024-09-03 21:28:32
9603,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,But you didn't even ask me! You just went ahead and did it.,2024-09-03 21:31:32
9604,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,You're right. I should have asked first. I just thought it was a good idea and wanted to get started.,2024-09-03 21:37:32
9605,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,It's not fair. I've been working on that idea for weeks.,2024-09-03 21:42:32
9606,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,I see that now. I was just excited and didn't think it through. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:48:32
9607,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,I want some credit for my work. Can we present it together?,2024-09-03 21:51:32
9608,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's adjust the presentation slides and make sure everyone knows it was a team effort.",2024-09-03 22:00:32
9609,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,"That sounds fair. Next time, let's be more open about our ideas before taking action.",2024-09-03 22:06:32
9610,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. Let's make this project the best it can be, together.",2024-09-03 22:07:32
9611,deescalatory_conversation_60,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's get started on the revisions.,2024-09-03 22:17:32
9612,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"We need to talk about the project, Sarah. The deadline is next week, and we aren't even close to being done.",2024-09-03 21:19:34
9613,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,"I know, Mark, but I've been pulling all-nighters to finish my part. What about you?",2024-09-03 21:22:34
9614,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"I've been working on it too, but we clearly have a disconnect in our responsibilities. I think we need to reallocate tasks.",2024-09-03 21:28:34
9615,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,Maybe you're right. What do you suggest we change?,2024-09-03 21:30:34
9616,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,Let's look at what's left. I can take over the data analysis if you can focus on the report writing.,2024-09-03 21:38:34
9617,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,That actually might work better. I've been struggling with the analysis part anyway.,2024-09-03 21:47:34
9618,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"Great, so I'll handle the data analysis. Can we set a check-in time to make sure we're on track?",2024-09-03 21:57:34
9619,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,"Sure, how about we check in every evening at 7 PM?",2024-09-03 22:04:34
9620,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,That works for me. I think communicating more openly will help us meet this deadline.,2024-09-03 22:09:34
9621,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's also share our progress updates on the team chat to keep everyone in the loop.,2024-09-03 22:12:34
9622,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,Sounds good. We'll get through this together.,2024-09-03 22:14:34
9623,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_2,"Thanks, Mark. I'm glad we could resolve this without any major issues.",2024-09-03 22:24:34
9624,deescalatory_conversation_61,speaker_1,"Me too, Sarah. Let's get to work and finish this project strong.",2024-09-03 22:28:34
9625,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,"Jake, I don't understand why you didn't pass me the ball in the last play. We could have scored.",2024-09-03 21:16:36
9626,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,"Sarah, it wasn't on purpose. I just didn't see you open. The defender was all over me.",2024-09-03 21:26:36
9627,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_3,"Come on, guys. Let's not point fingers. We all made mistakes out there.",2024-09-03 21:32:36
9628,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,It's just frustrating. We've been working on our communication for weeks.,2024-09-03 21:41:36
9629,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,"I get it, but yelling at each other isn't helping. How can we fix this?",2024-09-03 21:44:36
9630,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_3,Maybe we should focus on our positioning more during practice.,2024-09-03 21:53:36
9631,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,That's a good idea. We need to be more aware of each other on the court.,2024-09-03 21:58:36
9632,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,And we could come up with some signals or calls to help with that.,2024-09-03 22:03:36
9633,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_3,Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to the coach and see if we can set up some extra drills.,2024-09-03 22:04:36
9634,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_1,"Great, let's do that. I want us to be the best team we can be.",2024-09-03 22:13:36
9635,deescalatory_conversation_62,speaker_2,"Agreed. We're in this together, and we'll figure it out.",2024-09-03 22:14:36
9636,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,"I can't believe you got us all benched today, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:22:39
9637,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,Benched? We lost because no one passed me the ball!,2024-09-03 21:30:39
9638,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. We're a team; we win together and lose together.",2024-09-03 21:33:39
9639,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_4,Exactly. Arguing like this won't solve anything. We should focus on improving for the next game.,2024-09-03 21:42:39
9640,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,I just don't understand why everyone blames me when I try my best out there.,2024-09-03 21:52:39
9641,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,"We're not blaming you, Jake. It feels like the team is falling apart because we're not communicating.",2024-09-03 21:58:39
9642,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_3,Let's talk about what went wrong instead of pointing fingers. Maybe we need to strategize better.,2024-09-03 22:05:39
9643,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_4,"Agreed. Let's figure out our weak points in the game. Jake, what do you think we should do differently?",2024-09-03 22:09:39
9644,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,"I think we need better coordination. Sometimes, I don't even know what the plan is during crucial plays.",2024-09-03 22:14:39
9645,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_1,Good point. We should have clearer communication on the field. Maybe more signal plays?,2024-09-03 22:17:39
9646,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_3,"Yeah, I think signal plays could work. And perhaps we can have a quick huddle before the game starts to ensure everyone's on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:21:39
9647,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_4,Sounds good. Let's also make sure to encourage each other more. Positive vibes can boost our performance.,2024-09-03 22:29:39
9648,deescalatory_conversation_63,speaker_2,"Thanks, guys. I appreciate you listening. Let's make sure we learn from this",2024-09-03 22:36:39
9649,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and accepted that role without even consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:14:42
9650,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,"I know, I should have talked to you first, but we were running out of time and I had to make a decision quickly.",2024-09-03 21:23:42
9651,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,But we're partners in this theater production. Decisions like these affect both of us.,2024-09-03 21:26:42
9652,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,You're right. I didn't consider how it would impact you. What can we do now to make it work?,2024-09-03 21:35:42
9653,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,"Well, first, we need to reassign some of the duties to balance the workload.",2024-09-03 21:44:42
9654,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,"Agreed. How about I take over the props management, so you can focus more on directing the rehearsals?",2024-09-03 21:54:42
9655,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,That could work. And maybe we should have a standing meeting every week to discuss any major decisions before either of us commits to anything.,2024-09-03 21:55:42
9656,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,I think that's a great idea. It will help us stay on the same page and prevent this from happening again.,2024-09-03 22:01:42
9657,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,"Okay, let's do that. Can we start with a meeting this Friday?",2024-09-03 22:11:42
9658,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll set up a time and a place for us to meet. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:16:42
9659,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_1,I appreciate you being willing to make changes. Let's make this the best production yet.,2024-09-03 22:17:42
9660,deescalatory_conversation_64,speaker_2,Definitely. We're in this together.,2024-09-03 22:20:42
9661,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,I can't believe you took credit for my research at the team meeting.,2024-09-03 21:17:45
9662,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,"Hold on, that's not exactly what happened. I was summarizing our joint effort.",2024-09-03 21:26:45
9663,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,Joint effort? You didn't even mention my name.,2024-09-03 21:35:45
9664,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,I understand why you're upset. It was an oversight. I should have credited you properly.,2024-09-03 21:44:45
9665,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,"Oversight or not, it feels like you wanted all the recognition.",2024-09-03 21:45:45
9666,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,That's not my intention at all. Your contributions are invaluable to this project.,2024-09-03 21:54:45
9667,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,"So, what are you going to do about it?",2024-09-03 22:00:45
9668,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,"I can bring it up at our next meeting and make sure everyone knows it was a team effort, especially highlighting your work.",2024-09-03 22:03:45
9669,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,That would be a start. But I also need assurance this won't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:05:45
9670,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,Fair point. How about we agree to always communicate clearly how we'll present our work so no one's left out?,2024-09-03 22:06:45
9671,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,Agreed. And let's make sure we both review presentations beforehand.,2024-09-03 22:09:45
9672,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,Deal. I value our collaboration too much to let something like this get between us.,2024-09-03 22:14:45
9673,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_1,Me too. Let's make sure the project benefits from both our strengths.,2024-09-03 22:21:45
9674,deescalatory_conversation_65,speaker_2,Absolutely. We'll make it stronger together.,2024-09-03 22:29:45
9675,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were taking the lead on the project?,2024-09-03 21:15:47
9676,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,I thought it was obvious when I started organizing the tasks.,2024-09-03 21:22:47
9677,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,It wasn't obvious to me. We should've discussed it first.,2024-09-03 21:31:47
9678,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,"You're right, we should have talked about it. I just thought I'd save us time.",2024-09-03 21:35:47
9679,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,"Saving time is good, but not at the expense of clarity.",2024-09-03 21:41:47
9680,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,I understand. How about we set up regular check-ins to avoid this in the future?,2024-09-03 21:47:47
9681,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,That's a good idea. We should also update the team on this change.,2024-09-03 21:48:47
9682,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's email everyone after this to keep them in the loop.,2024-09-03 21:50:47
9683,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,"Perfect. And next time, let's make sure we communicate our roles more clearly from the start.",2024-09-03 22:00:47
9684,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,Definitely. Thanks for being open to talking about this.,2024-09-03 22:04:47
9685,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_1,Thanks for listening. I think this will help our project a lot.,2024-09-03 22:13:47
9686,deescalatory_conversation_66,speaker_2,Me too. Let's get back to work and make sure everyone is on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:23:47
9687,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,"Hey, I noticed that the last few reports have had some errors in them. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:19:49
9688,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,"I know, I've been really overwhelmed with other projects. It's hard to keep up.",2024-09-03 21:21:49
9689,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,"I get that, but these reports are crucial for our team's performance. Can we find a way to manage this better?",2024-09-03 21:30:49
9690,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,Maybe we could set up a review system? It could help catch mistakes before the reports go out.,2024-09-03 21:33:49
9691,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,That sounds like a solid idea. How about we pair up so we can check each other's work?,2024-09-03 21:38:49
9692,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,"I think that could work. I'll start by double-checking today's report, and you can review it after?",2024-09-03 21:42:49
9693,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,"Deal. And if anything still seems off, let's bring it up right away so we can fix it together.",2024-09-03 21:45:49
9694,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for being understanding. I really want us to do well as a team.,2024-09-03 21:49:49
9695,deescalatory_conversation_67,speaker_1,Me too. Let's keep communicating like this to make sure we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:59:49
9696,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without even consulting us.,2024-09-03 21:21:53
9697,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, everything was pretty much done anyway.",2024-09-03 21:24:53
9698,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,It was a big deal to us. We wanted to review it together to make sure everything was perfect.,2024-09-03 21:29:53
9699,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_3,"Yeah, we all worked hard on different parts. It would’ve been nice to finalize it as a team.",2024-09-03 21:30:53
9700,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,"I’m sorry, I just thought I was helping by getting it in on time.",2024-09-03 21:34:53
9701,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_3,"We get that, but teamwork includes making decisions together.",2024-09-03 21:41:53
9702,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,"Exactly. Next time, let’s make sure we all agree before making the final move, okay?",2024-09-03 21:42:53
9703,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll definitely wait for everyone’s input next time. Can we talk about what went well in the project though?,2024-09-03 21:43:53
9704,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_3,"Sure, we can learn from this and improve. I think the research part we did was pretty solid.",2024-09-03 21:49:53
9705,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,And the design elements were on point. We complement each other’s strengths well.,2024-09-03 21:52:53
9706,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,That’s true. Sorry again for jumping the gun. Let’s celebrate what worked and plan better for the future.,2024-09-03 21:57:53
9707,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_3,"Definitely. Moving forward, we know communication is key.",2024-09-03 22:02:53
9708,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_1,Absolutely. Thanks for understanding. Let’s make the next project even better by working together more closely.,2024-09-03 22:08:53
9709,deescalatory_conversation_68,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan,2024-09-03 22:10:53
9710,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,"We need to talk about the math homework, John. I know you copied my answers.",2024-09-03 21:22:56
9711,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,"Sarah, I just looked at them for reference. I didn't actually copy everything.",2024-09-03 21:23:56
9712,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,But it's obvious to Ms. Johnson that our work is too similar. Now we're both in trouble.,2024-09-03 21:32:56
9713,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,I didn't mean for this to happen. I was stuck and didn't know how to solve it.,2024-09-03 21:37:56
9714,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,You could've asked me for help instead of just copying. I would've explained it to you.,2024-09-03 21:43:56
9715,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,I didn't want to bother you. You always seem so busy with your own stuff.,2024-09-03 21:47:56
9716,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,I'd rather be bothered than get accused of cheating. Now we have to face the consequences together.,2024-09-03 21:51:56
9717,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,You're right. I messed up. Can we talk to Ms. Johnson and explain the situation?,2024-09-03 21:57:56
9718,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's be honest with her. Hopefully, she understands and gives us a chance to make it right.",2024-09-03 21:59:56
9719,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,"Okay, I'll apologize and offer to redo the homework with your help.",2024-09-03 22:02:56
9720,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,That's a good idea. Let's learn from this and make sure it doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:12:56
9721,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for being willing to help even after all this.,2024-09-03 22:21:56
9722,deescalatory_conversation_69,speaker_1,"No problem, John. Let's handle this together and ensure we support each other better next time.",2024-09-03 22:30:56
9723,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,"Why did you skip practice yesterday, Mark? We really needed you there.",2024-09-03 21:20:00
9724,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework to catch up on, Sarah. I've been struggling to keep up.",2024-09-03 21:25:00
9725,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,Homework? This is the third time you've missed practice this month.,2024-09-03 21:33:00
9726,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry, but school has been overwhelming lately.",2024-09-03 21:38:00
9727,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_3,"Guys, let's stay focused here. Mark, can you make it to the next practice?",2024-09-03 21:42:00
9728,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,"I'll do my best to be there, Coach. I just need to manage my time better.",2024-09-03 21:48:00
9729,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,"It's not just about being there, Mark. We need you to be fully present and committed.",2024-09-03 21:58:00
9730,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,"I understand that, Sarah. I care about the team and I want to contribute.",2024-09-03 22:01:00
9731,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_3,"Alright, let's make a plan. Mark, can you communicate with us if you're struggling with homework so we can find a solution together?",2024-09-03 22:10:00
9732,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I’ll make sure to let you both know ahead of time if I’m having issues.,2024-09-03 22:16:00
9733,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,"Thanks, Mark. We just want to know we can count on you.",2024-09-03 22:17:00
9734,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_3,"Great, teamwork is key. Let’s all work together and support each other.",2024-09-03 22:22:00
9735,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to balance my responsibilities better from now on.,2024-09-03 22:23:00
9736,deescalatory_conversation_70,speaker_1,"We appreciate it, Mark. Let's give our best effort at the",2024-09-03 22:26:00
9737,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,"I can't believe you would hit ""reply all"" on that email, Sarah. It made us all look incompetent.",2024-09-03 21:17:03
9738,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,"Mark, I didn't intend to hit ""reply all."" It was a mistake. I'm really sorry.",2024-09-03 21:18:03
9739,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,But it's happened before. How do I know it won't keep happening?,2024-09-03 21:23:03
9740,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,"I understand your concern, and I promise to be more careful from now on.",2024-09-03 21:31:03
9741,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_3,"Guys, let's think about how we can prevent this from happening again. Maybe we can create a protocol for email responses?",2024-09-03 21:34:03
9742,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,"A protocol might help, sure. But it's just frustrating that we're even in this situation.",2024-09-03 21:43:03
9743,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,"I get it, Mark. I'll make sure to double-check every email before sending it. Maybe a quick checklist can help?",2024-09-03 21:49:03
9744,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_3,"That sounds like a good idea, Sarah. And Mark, could you help us draft that checklist? Your input could be valuable.",2024-09-03 21:55:03
9745,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,"Alright, I can contribute to that. I just want us to be seen as the competent team we are.",2024-09-03 22:01:03
9746,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,Absolutely. I want that too. Let's move forward with the checklist plan.,2024-09-03 22:08:03
9747,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_3,Great! Let's have a quick meeting tomorrow to finalize the checklist and make sure everyone's on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:18:03
9748,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_1,"Sounds good to me. Thanks for resolving this, guys.",2024-09-03 22:19:03
9749,deescalatory_conversation_71,speaker_2,"Thanks, Mark. I appreciate your understanding.",2024-09-03 22:26:03
9750,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,We need to talk about what happened during the group presentation today.,2024-09-03 21:16:07
9751,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"Yeah, what exactly went wrong, do you think?",2024-09-03 21:19:07
9752,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,I think it was clear that our slides were mixed up. You were supposed to cover the market analysis part.,2024-09-03 21:23:07
9753,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"I know, but you jumped into it before I got a chance. It caught me off guard.",2024-09-03 21:27:07
9754,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,"I jumped in because you weren't starting. We had a plan, and it seemed like you forgot.",2024-09-03 21:30:07
9755,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,I didn't forget. I was just waiting for the right moment. Maybe the issue was our communication leading up to the presentation.,2024-09-03 21:39:07
9756,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,That's fair. Maybe we should have practiced our transitions more thoroughly.,2024-09-03 21:40:07
9757,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"Agreed. Maybe next time, we can allocate more time to rehearse. It's important to get each part right.",2024-09-03 21:43:07
9758,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,"Absolutely. And if someone needs a moment, we should have a signal to indicate that instead of jumping in.",2024-09-03 21:49:07
9759,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,"Yes, that would help avoid confusion. Also, let's be clear about who's covering what part in our plan.",2024-09-03 21:57:07
9760,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,Good idea. I think we both want the project to succeed. We just need better coordination.,2024-09-03 22:04:07
9761,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's set some extra time aside to refine our parts and practice together more.,2024-09-03 22:07:07
9762,deescalatory_conversation_72,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. We should also check in regularly to make sure we're both on the same page,2024-09-03 22:14:07
9763,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you tell me you were planning to drop out of the group project, Sophie?",2024-09-03 21:23:12
9764,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,"I didn’t drop out, Jake. I just couldn’t make it to the last two meetings because of family stuff.",2024-09-03 21:32:12
9765,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,But you didn’t even let us know! We had no idea what happened to you.,2024-09-03 21:35:12
9766,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,"I know, and I’m really sorry about that. Things just got overwhelming, and I didn’t handle it well.",2024-09-03 21:37:12
9767,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,You could have at least sent a text. We were counting on you for the presentation prep.,2024-09-03 21:40:12
9768,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_3,"Hey, let’s take a step back. Sophie, why didn’t you reach out to us? Were you dealing with something serious?",2024-09-03 21:49:12
9769,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,"Yes, my mom was in the hospital. I should have told you guys, but I was just so stressed out.",2024-09-03 21:54:12
9770,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,I’m really sorry to hear about your mom. I didn’t know it was something so important.,2024-09-03 22:02:12
9771,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,"Thanks, Jake. I appreciate it. I’m really sorry for leaving you hanging.",2024-09-03 22:03:12
9772,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_3,Let’s figure out how we can move forward from here. Do we have enough time to reassign tasks and still make a good presentation?,2024-09-03 22:12:12
9773,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_1,"Yeah, I think we can. Sophie, can you still help us out if we redistribute some of the work?",2024-09-03 22:14:12
9774,deescalatory_conversation_73,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’m back on track now and,2024-09-03 22:18:12
9775,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,Why did you delete all the files from the shared drive?,2024-09-03 21:21:15
9776,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,I didn't delete them; I just moved them to a different folder.,2024-09-03 21:31:15
9777,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,You didn't tell anyone before doing it. We couldn't find anything for hours.,2024-09-03 21:35:15
9778,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,I should've communicated better. I thought it would be more organized that way.,2024-09-03 21:41:15
9779,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,But everyone was confused. It really disrupted our workflow.,2024-09-03 21:49:15
9780,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,"I understand. Next time, I'll make sure to inform everyone before making such changes.",2024-09-03 21:53:15
9781,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,"Thanks, that would help. Where did you move the files, by the way?",2024-09-03 22:03:15
9782,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,"They're in the ""Project Archives"" folder now. I can help you find anything you're looking for.",2024-09-03 22:08:15
9783,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,"Okay, that makes sense. We just need to ensure everyone knows about it to avoid confusion.",2024-09-03 22:13:15
9784,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,Agreed. Sorry for the frustration caused. I'll send an email to the team to explain the new organization.,2024-09-03 22:15:15
9785,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_1,That's a good idea. Let's all try to communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:24:15
9786,deescalatory_conversation_74,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's make sure we're on the same page from now on.,2024-09-03 22:26:15
9787,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you borrowed my car last night?,2024-09-03 21:20:18
9788,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,I didn't think it'd be a big deal. I just needed it for a quick errand.,2024-09-03 21:25:18
9789,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,But it's my car! You should've asked!,2024-09-03 21:29:18
9790,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, okay? It was a last-minute thing. I didn’t think you'd mind.",2024-09-03 21:37:18
9791,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,It's not about whether I'd mind or not. What if something had happened?,2024-09-03 21:47:18
9792,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,You're right. I should have thought about that. How can I make it up to you?,2024-09-03 21:48:18
9793,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,I just want you to respect my things in the future. Can we agree on that?,2024-09-03 21:54:18
9794,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,"Yes, absolutely. In the future, I'll ask before using your car or anything else.",2024-09-03 22:03:18
9795,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate that. We should also figure out a better way to communicate.,2024-09-03 22:05:18
9796,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,Definitely. Maybe we can set up a schedule or something for shared things?,2024-09-03 22:10:18
9797,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. Let's draft something up later.,2024-09-03 22:14:18
9798,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,"Agreed. And again, I'm really sorry for taking your car without asking.",2024-09-03 22:16:18
9799,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let's move forward from this.,2024-09-03 22:24:18
9800,deescalatory_conversation_75,speaker_2,Thanks for being understanding. I’ll make sure this doesn’t happen again.,2024-09-03 22:30:18
9801,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,"Why did you change the proposal without telling me, Mia?",2024-09-03 21:21:23
9802,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,"Tom, I needed to make those changes because the client wants something different now. I thought it was urgent.",2024-09-03 21:28:23
9803,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,But we've always agreed to discuss major changes together first! This is a partnership.,2024-09-03 21:37:23
9804,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I was under the impression we didn't have time to debate it. I'm sorry if I overstepped.",2024-09-03 21:46:23
9805,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,"It's not just about overstepping. We end up giving conflicting information to the client, and that makes us look bad.",2024-09-03 21:54:23
9806,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,I see your point. Maybe we should come up with a better system for urgent changes in the future. What do you think?,2024-09-03 21:59:23
9807,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,"That sounds reasonable. How about we set up a quick call protocol for these situations, even if it’s after hours?",2024-09-03 22:06:23
9808,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,"That could work. I can commit to that. In the meantime, should we update the client together now to clear any misunderstandings?",2024-09-03 22:14:23
9809,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,"Yes, let's do that. And for future reference, let's both agree to prioritize communication, even under time pressure.",2024-09-03 22:18:23
9810,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for bringing this up, Tom. I appreciate it.",2024-09-03 22:28:23
9811,deescalatory_conversation_76,speaker_1,"No problem, Mia. Let's move forward and make sure this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:37:23
9812,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,"I can't believe you used the same project for both classes, Jenna. That's basically cheating.",2024-09-03 21:18:27
9813,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,"It's not cheating, Alex. There's no rule against reusing your own work.",2024-09-03 21:21:27
9814,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,"Maybe not, but it's still dishonest. You didn't even tell me you were going to do that.",2024-09-03 21:26:27
9815,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,I didn't think it would be a big deal. I just wanted to save some time.,2024-09-03 21:30:27
9816,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,"Still, it makes the rest of us look bad. We all put in extra effort, and you just recycled your project.",2024-09-03 21:40:27
9817,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,"I understand why you're upset, but I wasn't trying to undermine anyone's work. I just had a lot on my plate.",2024-09-03 21:49:27
9818,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,"If you had so much work, you could've asked for an extension or help.",2024-09-03 21:59:27
9819,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,"I guess I didn't think of that in the moment. I'm sorry, Alex. I should have communicated better.",2024-09-03 22:09:27
9820,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jenna. Maybe we should talk to the professor together and explain what happened.",2024-09-03 22:14:27
9821,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I want to make sure we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:15:27
9822,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's set up a meeting and clear this up.,2024-09-03 22:21:27
9823,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_2,"Okay. I'll email the professor and suggest a time. Thanks for being understanding, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:25:27
9824,deescalatory_conversation_77,speaker_1,No problem. Let's get through this together.,2024-09-03 22:29:27
9825,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,Why did you post that picture of me without asking first?,2024-09-03 21:18:30
9826,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal; we always share stuff from our outings.,2024-09-03 21:25:30
9827,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,"But this time, it was different. That picture was really unflattering.",2024-09-03 21:34:30
9828,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you would feel that way. I just thought it captured a funny moment.",2024-09-03 21:37:30
9829,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,"Well, it wasn't funny to me. Can you please take it down?",2024-09-03 21:41:30
9830,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,"Sure, I'll delete it right away. I never meant to upset you.",2024-09-03 21:44:30
9831,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,"Thanks. Just next time, let me know before you post something, okay?",2024-09-03 21:53:30
9832,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll definitely check with you first from now on.,2024-09-03 22:00:30
9833,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,"I appreciate that. I know you didn't do it on purpose, I just felt embarrassed.",2024-09-03 22:10:30
9834,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,I understand. I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable. I'm really sorry again.,2024-09-03 22:18:30
9835,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let's just move past it.,2024-09-03 22:24:30
9836,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's plan our next outing. Maybe we can agree on photos together this time?,2024-09-03 22:29:30
9837,deescalatory_conversation_78,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:30:30
9838,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,"We really need to talk about the group project, guys. We're not making any progress.",2024-09-03 21:22:34
9839,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,"I know, but every time I try to suggest something, it feels like everyone just ignores me.",2024-09-03 21:25:34
9840,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_3,"It's not that we ignore you, it's just your ideas sometimes go off track.",2024-09-03 21:32:34
9841,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,"Okay, let's stop pointing fingers. We need to figure out how to work together better.",2024-09-03 21:41:34
9842,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_4,"Maybe if we split the tasks based on what we're all good at, we can make better progress.",2024-09-03 21:47:34
9843,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I think I could handle the research part.,2024-09-03 21:50:34
9844,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_3,"Yeah, and I can do the data analysis. I actually enjoy that.",2024-09-03 21:51:34
9845,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,"Alright, I can coordinate everything and make sure we're on track. What about you, speaker_4?",2024-09-03 21:55:34
9846,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_4,I can handle the writing. I'm pretty good at shaping things up for the final report.,2024-09-03 21:59:34
9847,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,"Okay, now that we have roles, let's set some deadlines so we keep moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:08:34
9848,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's also check in regularly to make sure we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:12:34
9849,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_3,Sounds good. Can we set up a group chat or something for quick communication?,2024-09-03 22:21:34
9850,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_1,Definitely. I'll create it right after this meeting.,2024-09-03 22:22:34
9851,deescalatory_conversation_79,speaker_4,"Alright, I think we have a plan. Let's make sure we stick to it this time.",2024-09-03 22:26:34
9852,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,"You always hog the spotlight during our band practices, Sarah. It's really frustrating!",2024-09-03 21:20:38
9853,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,"David, I'm not trying to hog the spotlight. I'm just passionate about what we play.",2024-09-03 21:28:38
9854,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,"But it feels like every time you take over, we don't get a chance to contribute our ideas.",2024-09-03 21:34:38
9855,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,Maybe there's a way for everyone to showcase their talents equally. Can we figure out a better way to divide solo parts?,2024-09-03 21:39:38
9856,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,I’m open to that. I didn’t realize I was overshadowing others. What do you suggest?,2024-09-03 21:49:38
9857,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,"What if we rotate solo parts for each song? That way, we all get a chance to shine.",2024-09-03 21:51:38
9858,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,Sounds fair to me. And we can even decide based on whose strengths fit each song best.,2024-09-03 22:01:38
9859,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_2,"Okay, let's try that out. I want us all to enjoy this and feel like we’re contributing.",2024-09-03 22:10:38
9860,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_1,"Appreciate it, Sarah. I think we’ll sound even better with more input.",2024-09-03 22:18:38
9861,deescalatory_conversation_80,speaker_3,Agreed. Let’s start with the next practice and see how it goes.,2024-09-03 22:28:38
9862,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,"Hey, why haven't you submitted the group project report yet?",2024-09-03 21:23:44
9863,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,"I was waiting for everyone to review the final draft, but I didn't get any feedback.",2024-09-03 21:27:44
9864,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_3,I thought we all agreed on the final version last week. What more feedback were you waiting for?,2024-09-03 21:37:44
9865,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_4,"Yeah, we did agree. But I think it was your job to finalize the references, wasn't it?",2024-09-03 21:47:44
9866,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,Can we at least agree that we need to submit it by tonight? This back-and-forth isn't helping.,2024-09-03 21:50:44
9867,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's just go over the main points one last time to make sure everything is covered.,2024-09-03 21:53:44
9868,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_3,"Okay, I'll start by checking the introduction and conclusion. They should mirror each other and lead the reader smoothly from start to finish.",2024-09-03 21:55:44
9869,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_4,I'll go over the references once more to make sure they're formatted correctly and we haven't missed any.,2024-09-03 22:01:44
9870,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,I'll handle the transitions between sections. We don't want the report to feel disjointed.,2024-09-03 22:08:44
9871,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,"Thanks, everyone. Let's focus on these tasks and meet up in an hour to finalize it.",2024-09-03 22:13:44
9872,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_3,Sounds good. We can do this.,2024-09-03 22:14:44
9873,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_4,Understood. Let's make this the best report we can.,2024-09-03 22:19:44
9874,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_1,Great. See you all in an hour. Let's make sure we submit it on time this time.,2024-09-03 22:20:44
9875,deescalatory_conversation_81,speaker_2,"Definitely. Thanks for coming together on this,",2024-09-03 22:24:44
9876,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,"We really need to talk about this, Alex. The group's not happy with how you've been handling the project.",2024-09-03 21:19:47
9877,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Jamie? I've been doing my part.",2024-09-03 21:20:47
9878,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,"It's not about you doing your part, it's about how you're doing it. You keep making decisions without consulting us.",2024-09-03 21:28:47
9879,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,I just thought it would be faster if I took the initiative. We have deadlines to meet.,2024-09-03 21:31:47
9880,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,"I get that, but it's causing confusion. Like when you changed the design layout without telling anyone.",2024-09-03 21:32:47
9881,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,"Okay, fair point. But the old layout wasn't working. I thought everyone would see that.",2024-09-03 21:42:47
9882,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,"Maybe, but we need to be on the same page. Can we agree to discuss major changes before implementing them?",2024-09-03 21:51:47
9883,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,"Yeah, that sounds fair. I didn't mean to step on anyone's toes.",2024-09-03 21:58:47
9884,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. We all want this project to succeed. Let's make sure we handle decisions together from now on.",2024-09-03 22:01:47
9885,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,Definitely. I'll keep everyone in the loop moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:10:47
9886,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_1,Great. Let's catch up with the others and go over what needs to be done next.,2024-09-03 22:11:47
9887,deescalatory_conversation_82,speaker_2,I'm in. Let's get this back on track.,2024-09-03 22:17:47
9888,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the project without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:21:51
9889,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"I had to, we were running out of time and you weren't responding to my messages.",2024-09-03 21:31:51
9890,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,"But we agreed to review everything together before hitting send. It's a team project, remember?",2024-09-03 21:32:51
9891,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"I know, but I didn't want us to miss the deadline. What was I supposed to do?",2024-09-03 21:41:51
9892,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,You could have called me. You knew I was busy with other assignments.,2024-09-03 21:44:51
9893,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have. I'm sorry about that. Can we look at what was submitted and make sure it's okay?",2024-09-03 21:53:51
9894,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's do that. I just want to make sure our work reflects both of our efforts.",2024-09-03 22:00:51
9895,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"Agreed. Next time, let's set up a better communication plan to avoid this confusion.",2024-09-03 22:09:51
9896,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,Definitely. How about we schedule a quick check-in every evening until we finish our projects?,2024-09-03 22:10:51
9897,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"That sounds like a good idea. We both want the best results, so being on the same page is important.",2024-09-03 22:16:51
9898,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I'll pull up the submitted file so we can review it together.,2024-09-03 22:24:51
9899,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_2,"Great. Let's make sure it's up to our standards, even if we have to resubmit.",2024-09-03 22:25:51
9900,deescalatory_conversation_83,speaker_1,Perfect. Let's get to work on it now.,2024-09-03 22:31:51
9901,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_1,Why did you change the project outline without consulting us?,2024-09-03 21:17:54
9902,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,I thought it would make things more efficient for the team.,2024-09-03 21:18:54
9903,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_1,But it threw off our entire timeline. We need to discuss these decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:22:54
9904,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_3,I agree with speaker_1. We were all set to start with the original plan.,2024-09-03 21:28:54
9905,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,I get that. I should have asked for input first. What if we combine some of your ideas with the new outline?,2024-09-03 21:36:54
9906,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_1,That could work. But we need to make sure everyone has a chance to weigh in.,2024-09-03 21:42:54
9907,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_3,"Yes, let's call a meeting and ensure everyone's on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:50:54
9908,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,"Alright, I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow. I'll listen more to your concerns moving forward.",2024-09-03 21:57:54
9909,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_1,"Thanks, speaker_2. Let's focus on aligning our efforts for the rest of the project.",2024-09-03 21:59:54
9910,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_3,We can get back on track if we work together. Let's make this project a success.,2024-09-03 22:06:54
9911,deescalatory_conversation_84,speaker_2,Agreed. I appreciate your understanding.,2024-09-03 22:09:54
9912,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were working on the project with someone else?,2024-09-03 21:16:58
9913,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,I thought it would be easier if we split the workload. You were busy with your other commitments.,2024-09-03 21:24:58
9914,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,But we agreed to do it together. Now it feels like you left me out of the loop.,2024-09-03 21:29:58
9915,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,I'm sorry if it seemed that way. I just didn't want you to feel overwhelmed.,2024-09-03 21:30:58
9916,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,"I get that, but I still needed to know. Communication is important.",2024-09-03 21:36:58
9917,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,You're right. I should have told you. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:45:58
9918,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,Can you catch me up on what you've done so far?,2024-09-03 21:54:58
9919,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"Of course. I've created an outline, and we’ve divided the tasks. Would you like to take a look?",2024-09-03 21:59:58
9920,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,"Yes, that would help. I want to contribute as much as possible.",2024-09-03 22:09:58
9921,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,"Great! Let's go over it together, and you can decide which parts you want to handle.",2024-09-03 22:11:58
9922,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,That sounds good. Let's make sure we keep each other updated from now on.,2024-09-03 22:21:58
9923,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,Agreed. We’re a team and should always be on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:26:58
9924,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. We'll finish this project strong together.,2024-09-03 22:31:58
9925,deescalatory_conversation_85,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let’s get started and make this the best we can.,2024-09-03 22:41:58
9926,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and changed our project topic without consulting me.,2024-09-03 21:20:01
9927,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but the topic we had wasn't working out. I thought this new one would be better.",2024-09-03 21:21:01
9928,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,We had already put in so much work on the original topic. Now we have to start from scratch!,2024-09-03 21:22:01
9929,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"I get that it's frustrating, but we've been stuck for weeks. This new topic actually has more available resources.",2024-09-03 21:25:01
9930,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,"That's true, but I wish we could have at least discussed it first. It feels like you made the decision on your own.",2024-09-03 21:32:01
9931,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have talked to you first. I just didn't want us to waste more time being stuck.",2024-09-03 21:39:01
9932,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,I appreciate that you're trying to keep us on track. Maybe we can quickly outline the new topic together now?,2024-09-03 21:43:01
9933,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. Let's list out what we need to do next and get back on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:49:01
9934,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,"Okay, let's start with finding some key sources. Then we can divide up the sections to work on.",2024-09-03 21:52:01
9935,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'll start researching the introduction, and you can look into the main issues. We'll meet up and compare notes?",2024-09-03 21:56:01
9936,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_1,Sounds good. Thanks for being willing to talk this through.,2024-09-03 22:05:01
9937,deescalatory_conversation_86,speaker_2,"No problem. We're a team, after all. Let's get this done!",2024-09-03 22:13:01
9938,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,I can't believe you finished the project without even consulting me.,2024-09-03 21:22:05
9939,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,"Look, I know it seems unfair, but we were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:31:05
9940,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,But we agreed to work on it together! You just went ahead and did everything by yourself.,2024-09-03 21:32:05
9941,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,I understand why you're upset. I should have communicated better. Can we at least focus on getting it submitted on time?,2024-09-03 21:40:05
9942,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,It's not just about submission. It's about respect and teamwork.,2024-09-03 21:42:05
9943,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,You're right. I apologize for not being considerate. How can we fix this moving forward?,2024-09-03 21:49:05
9944,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,Maybe next time we can set specific times to meet so we're both involved?,2024-09-03 21:51:05
9945,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. Let's schedule regular check-ins to ensure we're on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:57:05
9946,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,Okay. Let's do that and finalize this project together right now. We still have a few hours.,2024-09-03 21:59:05
9947,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's go through everything and make sure it's ready to submit.,2024-09-03 22:03:05
9948,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I don't want this to happen again.,2024-09-03 22:06:05
9949,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,"Neither do I. Teamwork is important, and I'll make sure to always keep you in the loop.",2024-09-03 22:13:05
9950,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_1,"Alright, let's get this done. We can make a great team if we communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:21:05
9951,deescalatory_conversation_87,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's work on making this project the best it can be together.,2024-09-03 22:29:05
9952,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,"Why did you move my research materials off the desk, John?",2024-09-03 21:22:09
9953,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,"I needed space to work on my project, Maria. Yours was taking up the entire desk.",2024-09-03 21:23:09
9954,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,But you could have asked me first. I've been meticulously organizing those papers for weeks.,2024-09-03 21:29:09
9955,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I was in a rush and didn't think it would be a big deal to shift them temporarily.",2024-09-03 21:35:09
9956,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,It is a big deal to me. Now I'm worried something might be misplaced or ruined.,2024-09-03 21:36:09
9957,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,"Okay, let's not make this worse. How about we go through them together to check if everything is in order?",2024-09-03 21:38:09
9958,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,That would help. I just need to know that my work isn't compromised.,2024-09-03 21:43:09
9959,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's review everything now and make sure it’s all there. I apologize for not handling it better.",2024-09-03 21:45:09
9960,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,"Thanks, John. I appreciate you taking the time. Maybe we can come up with a system so this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 21:47:09
9961,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,Definitely. How about we designate specific areas for our projects to avoid overlapping in the future?,2024-09-03 21:50:09
9962,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,"That sounds like a good plan. We both need the space, after all.",2024-09-03 21:55:09
9963,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_2,"Agreed. And I’m genuinely sorry for the disruption, Maria. Let’s make this workspace efficient for both of us.",2024-09-03 22:03:09
9964,deescalatory_conversation_88,speaker_1,I accept your apology. Let's get back to being productive. Thanks,2024-09-03 22:05:09
9965,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,I saw the email you sent to Mr. Thompson. Why did you say we both agreed on the project changes?,2024-09-03 21:18:12
9966,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,Because I thought we were on the same page about adjusting the deadline and scope.,2024-09-03 21:19:12
9967,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,"We discussed it, but never decided for sure. You should've checked with me before informing him.",2024-09-03 21:22:12
9968,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,I understand that now. I guess I jumped the gun. How can we fix it?,2024-09-03 21:29:12
9969,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,We need to email him together and clarify. Let's not make unilateral decisions again.,2024-09-03 21:38:12
9970,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'll start drafting the email now, and you can add your input.",2024-09-03 21:41:12
9971,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's make sure we're always in sync before communicating important updates.,2024-09-03 21:48:12
9972,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,Definitely. Our communication needs to be clearer. Do you want to set a regular check-in meeting to discuss any project changes?,2024-09-03 21:49:12
9973,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,That's a good idea. How about every Tuesday afternoon?,2024-09-03 21:52:12
9974,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_2,Works for me. We'll avoid misunderstandings that way. I'll send a calendar invite.,2024-09-03 22:02:12
9975,deescalatory_conversation_89,speaker_1,Great. Let's handle this email first and then set up the new procedure.,2024-09-03 22:03:12
9976,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up to the group study session yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:18:15
9977,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, I texted you guys about it.",2024-09-03 21:20:15
9978,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,"Well, we really needed your input on the project. It feels like you're not invested.",2024-09-03 21:26:15
9979,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"I understand why it might seem that way, but I’m committed. Can we discuss what you covered so I can catch up?",2024-09-03 21:34:15
9980,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,We went over the main points of the final report. Do you think you can review the notes I shared and add your comments by tonight?,2024-09-03 21:40:15
9981,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll make it a priority. Is there anything specific you need me to focus on?",2024-09-03 21:41:15
9982,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,"The statistical analysis part. None of us are really good at it, and we know you have more experience with that.",2024-09-03 21:46:15
9983,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,Got it. I’ll dive into the notes right after class and start on the analysis. Are we meeting again soon to touch base?,2024-09-03 21:56:15
9984,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,"Yes, we have another session scheduled for Friday. Is that still a good time for you?",2024-09-03 22:01:15
9985,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_2,Friday works for me. Thanks for understanding. I appreciate it.,2024-09-03 22:02:15
9986,deescalatory_conversation_90,speaker_1,No problem. Let’s make sure we communicate better next time. We’re all in this together.,2024-09-03 22:03:15
9987,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were inviting Ben to the study group, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:20:20
9988,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"I didn't think it would be a big deal, Mark. We needed more people.",2024-09-03 21:21:20
9989,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,But you know Ben and I don't get along well. How do you expect us to study efficiently?,2024-09-03 21:25:20
9990,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"I understand your concern, but we need his expertise in chemistry. It's important for our exam.",2024-09-03 21:34:20
9991,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_3,"Hey guys, if it's a problem, I can leave. I don't want to cause any tension here.",2024-09-03 21:38:20
9992,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,"No, Ben, it's not about you leaving. We just need to find a way to all work together without conflict.",2024-09-03 21:41:20
9993,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"Maybe we can split the subjects? Like, Ben can help with chemistry, and Mark, you can take the lead on biology?",2024-09-03 21:43:20
9994,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,That could work. I'm okay with that if Ben is.,2024-09-03 21:48:20
9995,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_3,I'm on board. Let's just focus on passing this exam. We all need it.,2024-09-03 21:56:20
9996,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_2,"Great. So, let's set some ground rules to avoid any more misunderstandings. Agreed?",2024-09-03 22:04:20
9997,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_1,Agreed.,2024-09-03 22:06:20
9998,deescalatory_conversation_91,speaker_3,Agreed.,2024-09-03 22:16:20
9999,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,"Sarah, why did you take my notebook without asking? You know I need it for my project.",2024-09-03 21:19:24
10000,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,"Mark, I'm sorry. I was in a rush this morning and I just grabbed it. I didn't think it would be a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:28:24
10001,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,It is a big deal. I've been looking for it all day and it's thrown off my entire schedule.,2024-09-03 21:31:24
10002,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,I really didn't mean to cause you trouble. I had my own deadlines too and wasn’t thinking straight. Can we figure out a way to fix this?,2024-09-03 21:38:24
10003,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,"Well, I need my notebook back first. Do you have it right now?",2024-09-03 21:44:24
10004,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,"Yeah, I have it in my backpack. Here, take it. I’ll let you borrow mine if you need to catch up.",2024-09-03 21:48:24
10005,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,"Thanks, but what I really need is for us to communicate better. This isn't the first time something like this has happened.",2024-09-03 21:51:24
10006,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,You're right. I need to be more mindful about your stuff and make sure to ask before taking anything. What if we set some ground rules to avoid this in the future?,2024-09-03 21:52:24
10007,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,That would be helpful. Maybe we should both keep our work in separate places and make sure to double-check before grabbing anything.,2024-09-03 22:02:24
10008,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_2,"Agreed. And if either of us needs something, we should definitely ask first. Is that okay with you?",2024-09-03 22:06:24
10009,deescalatory_conversation_92,speaker_1,"Yeah, that sounds fair",2024-09-03 22:12:24
10010,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,"Hey, I noticed some discrepancies in our group project presentation slides. Did anyone else see those?",2024-09-03 21:22:30
10011,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,"Yeah, I saw them. I think we need to go over it again.",2024-09-03 21:27:30
10012,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_3,I didn’t see anything wrong. Are you sure? We’re already running behind schedule.,2024-09-03 21:35:30
10013,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,I think it's important to fix these mistakes so we get a better grade. Can we agree on that?,2024-09-03 21:41:30
10014,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,Absolutely. Maybe we can split the work to make it quicker?,2024-09-03 21:46:30
10015,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_4,I'm fine with that. Which sections need the most attention?,2024-09-03 21:56:30
10016,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,I noticed the statistics in section three were incorrect. And the conclusion seems rushed.,2024-09-03 21:58:30
10017,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_3,I can handle fixing the statistics if someone else can revise the conclusion.,2024-09-03 22:00:30
10018,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,I’ll take care of the conclusion. Does that work for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:01:30
10019,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_1,Sounds good to me. Let’s aim to have it done by tomorrow so there’s time for a final review.,2024-09-03 22:03:30
10020,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_4,Agreed. We can meet again tomorrow evening to go over the final draft.,2024-09-03 22:05:30
10021,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_3,Fair enough. I’ll get started on the statistics now and share my updates in the group chat.,2024-09-03 22:13:30
10022,deescalatory_conversation_93,speaker_2,I appreciate everyone’s willingness to help out. This should make our project even better.,2024-09-03 22:23:30
10023,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't tell me about the meeting change, Alex!",2024-09-03 21:16:32
10024,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"Jenna, it was a last-minute decision; I assumed you would check the updates yourself.",2024-09-03 21:18:32
10025,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,But you know how important that meeting was for our project. Now we're behind on everything!,2024-09-03 21:24:32
10026,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"I understand, and I'm sorry. How about we find a way to catch up on the work together?",2024-09-03 21:30:32
10027,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,That's easier said than done. We have so many deadlines approaching.,2024-09-03 21:33:32
10028,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"True, but if we split the tasks, we can manage them more efficiently. What do you think?",2024-09-03 21:39:32
10029,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,I guess that could work. But we need to communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 21:44:32
10030,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s sync our calendars and set up more frequent check-ins.,2024-09-03 21:54:32
10031,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"That sounds like a plan. Alright, let's get started on dividing the workload.",2024-09-03 21:59:32
10032,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_2,"Great, I'll make a list of the urgent tasks and we can go from there.",2024-09-03 22:04:32
10033,deescalatory_conversation_94,speaker_1,"Alright, thanks Alex. Let's get this project back on track.",2024-09-03 22:05:32
10034,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you keep undermining my decisions, Jenna. We agreed that I would lead this project for the school fundraiser.",2024-09-03 21:19:37
10035,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,"I'm not trying to undermine you, Alex. I just think some of your decisions aren't taking everyone's opinions into account.",2024-09-03 21:22:37
10036,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,"Well, it feels like you're constantly questioning my authority and it’s frustrating.",2024-09-03 21:26:37
10037,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,"I see how it could come off that way, but I really just want to make sure that the project succeeds and everyone feels included.",2024-09-03 21:32:37
10038,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,Can you give me an example of when you felt I wasn't considering others' input?,2024-09-03 21:34:37
10039,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,"Sure. For instance, when we picked the venue, a few people suggested a cheaper option, but you dismissed it without much discussion.",2024-09-03 21:39:37
10040,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,I remember that. I chose the more expensive venue because it has better facilities and I thought it would attract more attendees.,2024-09-03 21:42:37
10041,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,That makes sense. But maybe next time we could discuss the pros and cons more as a group before making a final decision?,2024-09-03 21:47:37
10042,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,You're right. I got caught up in my own vision for the event. How about we hold a team meeting to revisit some of these decisions?,2024-09-03 21:57:37
10043,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. I think it would help everyone feel more involved and invested in the project's success.,2024-09-03 22:06:37
10044,deescalatory_conversation_95,speaker_1,"Agreed. I appreciate your input, Jenna. Let's make this fundraiser the best it can be together",2024-09-03 22:07:37
10045,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,"Why did you take my tools without asking, Tom?",2024-09-03 21:21:41
10046,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,"I needed them for a school project, Dad.",2024-09-03 21:31:41
10047,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,But you know how important those tools are for my job. You should have asked.,2024-09-03 21:38:41
10048,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,I didn't think you'd mind since I was only using them for a little while.,2024-09-03 21:47:41
10049,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,"It's not about the time, it's about the principle of asking for permission. What if I needed them urgently?",2024-09-03 21:56:41
10050,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I didn't consider that. I should have asked first.",2024-09-03 22:04:41
10051,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,"What project are you working on, anyway?",2024-09-03 22:06:41
10052,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,It's a woodworking project for shop class. We're building birdhouses.,2024-09-03 22:12:41
10053,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,That sounds interesting. I could have helped you if you had told me earlier.,2024-09-03 22:16:41
10054,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,I didn't want to bother you. You've been so busy with work.,2024-09-03 22:17:41
10055,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, but I'm always here to help you. Just communicate with me next time.",2024-09-03 22:24:41
10056,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,I will. I'll make sure to ask and keep you informed.,2024-09-03 22:26:41
10057,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_1,"Good. Now, let's see how your project is coming along. Maybe we can work on it together.",2024-09-03 22:36:41
10058,deescalatory_conversation_96,speaker_2,"I'd like that. Thanks, Dad.",2024-09-03 22:39:41
10059,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,I can't believe you used my research without asking!,2024-09-03 21:15:43
10060,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,I thought we were sharing all our data for this group project.,2024-09-03 21:21:43
10061,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,"Sharing is one thing, but taking credit for my work isn't fair.",2024-09-03 21:24:43
10062,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,I'm sorry if it felt that way. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:29:43
10063,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,It'd be helpful if you acknowledged my contribution in the report.,2024-09-03 21:35:43
10064,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,I can definitely do that. Is there anything else?,2024-09-03 21:45:43
10065,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,Maybe we should set clearer boundaries for future research.,2024-09-03 21:46:43
10066,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's outline what we're each responsible for moving forward.,2024-09-03 21:54:43
10067,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I want us to succeed together.,2024-09-03 21:56:43
10068,deescalatory_conversation_97,speaker_2,Me too. Let's handle this as a team.,2024-09-03 22:05:43
10069,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,Can we talk about what happened during the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:21:51
10070,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,"Sure, what do you want to discuss?",2024-09-03 21:27:51
10071,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,I felt like you weren't really listening to any of my ideas.,2024-09-03 21:31:51
10072,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,I didn't realize you felt that way. Can you tell me which ideas you think I ignored?,2024-09-03 21:34:51
10073,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,"Well, for starters, I suggested dividing the work evenly, but you ended up taking most of it yourself.",2024-09-03 21:41:51
10074,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,I thought it would be easier if I handled the parts I was already familiar with. Did you want more tasks?,2024-09-03 21:50:51
10075,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,I just wanted to contribute more. I don't feel like I'm part of the team when I just sit there.,2024-09-03 21:51:51
10076,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,I see your point. How about we redistribute the tasks so that everyone gets an equal share this time?,2024-09-03 21:58:51
10077,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,I'd appreciate that. Can we also make sure to discuss everyone's ideas before moving forward next time?,2024-09-03 22:04:51
10078,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,Absolutely. I think that will make our project stronger. Is there anything else you think we should address?,2024-09-03 22:10:51
10079,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_1,"No, I think that covers it. Thanks for listening and understanding.",2024-09-03 22:17:51
10080,deescalatory_conversation_98,speaker_2,No problem. I'm glad we could sort this out. Let's make this project a success together.,2024-09-03 22:20:51
10081,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"I can't believe you missed another practice, Kevin. This is the third time this month.",2024-09-03 21:15:54
10082,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"Look, Mark, I’ve been really swamped with schoolwork. It's hard to balance everything.",2024-09-03 21:24:54
10083,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"We all have stuff going on, but the team relies on you. It's not fair to everyone else.",2024-09-03 21:25:54
10084,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. What can I do to make it up to you guys?",2024-09-03 21:31:54
10085,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"For starters, can you commit to making the next practice? We need you there.",2024-09-03 21:41:54
10086,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"Yes, I can do that. And I'll try to plan my workload better so this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 21:43:54
10087,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"Alright, that’s a step in the right direction. Maybe you can also share how you're managing your time between school and practice. It could help others who are struggling too.",2024-09-03 21:53:54
10088,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,Good idea. I’ll bring it up at the next practice. Let’s work together to solve this.,2024-09-03 22:03:54
10089,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"Sounds fair. Let’s focus on getting back on track as a team. We all want to win, right?",2024-09-03 22:10:54
10090,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for understanding, Mark.",2024-09-03 22:11:54
10091,deescalatory_conversation_99,speaker_1,"No problem, Kevin. Let’s move forward from this and get stronger as a team.",2024-09-03 22:21:54
10092,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you keep picking on me during practice, Coach.",2024-09-03 21:18:58
10093,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"It's not about picking on you, Jordan. I'm pushing you because I see your potential.",2024-09-03 21:26:58
10094,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,"But it feels like you’re always on my case, especially when we lose.",2024-09-03 21:28:58
10095,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,I'm hard on you because I know you can take it and grow from it. Do you think there's something specific we need to address in your game?,2024-09-03 21:31:58
10096,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,"I guess my defense needs work, but I feel singled out.",2024-09-03 21:33:58
10097,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"That's fair, Jordan. How do you think we can balance the feedback better?",2024-09-03 21:37:58
10098,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,"Maybe pointing out others' mistakes too, not just mine?",2024-09-03 21:46:58
10099,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,I can do that. How about we also have one-on-one sessions to focus on your areas for improvement?,2024-09-03 21:53:58
10100,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,That sounds good. I can handle criticism better when it's more private.,2024-09-03 21:55:58
10101,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"Great, let's start tomorrow. And remember, this feedback is meant to help the entire team, not just you.",2024-09-03 21:57:58
10102,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_1,"Thanks, Coach. I’ll try to keep that in mind.",2024-09-03 21:58:58
10103,deescalatory_conversation_100,speaker_2,"I appreciate that, Jordan. We're all in this together.",2024-09-03 22:04:58
10104,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,Why did you tell Coach that I missed practice on purpose? You know I was sick!,2024-09-03 21:20:02
10105,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to get you in trouble, I just thought Coach needed to know.",2024-09-03 21:28:02
10106,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,But now he's giving me extra laps to run! It's not fair!,2024-09-03 21:30:02
10107,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,I honestly didn't know he would do that. I'm really sorry.,2024-09-03 21:35:02
10108,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,Apologizing won't change the punishment.,2024-09-03 21:45:02
10109,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,"Hey, hold on. Let's think through this. Maybe we can go together and talk to Coach.",2024-09-03 21:47:02
10110,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,Why should I believe it'll make any difference?,2024-09-03 21:51:02
10111,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,"Because if we all tell him what actually happened, he'll have the full picture.",2024-09-03 21:58:02
10112,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,"Yeah, exactly. I'll tell him that I misunderstood the situation.",2024-09-03 22:03:02
10113,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,Fine. But you both have to back me up.,2024-09-03 22:12:02
10114,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,Absolutely. Let's set up a time to meet with him after school.,2024-09-03 22:20:02
10115,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,Sounds good to me. I'll text Coach right now to schedule it.,2024-09-03 22:30:02
10116,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,"Alright, but if he doesn't change his mind, I'm holding you accountable.",2024-09-03 22:32:02
10117,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,That's fair. Let's just make sure we explain everything clearly.,2024-09-03 22:37:02
10118,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_2,We will. We’ll get this sorted out together.,2024-09-03 22:47:02
10119,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_1,Okay. Thanks for offering to help. I just want this resolved.,2024-09-03 22:52:02
10120,deescalatory_conversation_101,speaker_3,"It will be. We're a team, after all.",2024-09-03 22:53:02
10121,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,"I really don't understand why you never pitch in for group projects, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:16:06
10122,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,"It's not that I don't want to. I just have other responsibilities that take up my time, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:26:06
10123,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,"We all have responsibilities, but we still find ways to contribute. This isn't fair to the rest of us.",2024-09-03 21:33:06
10124,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,"I get where you're coming from, but what am I supposed to do? I can't magically find more time.",2024-09-03 21:43:06
10125,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,"Maybe we can find a way to divide the tasks that work better for everyone. What do you think would be manageable for you, Mark?",2024-09-03 21:50:06
10126,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,I appreciate that. I can probably handle some of the research over the weekend if you guys can cover the writing sections until then.,2024-09-03 21:51:06
10127,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,"That's a start. We can manage that. But we need to see consistent effort from everyone, including you.",2024-09-03 21:52:06
10128,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,Understood. I'll be more active in our group meetings too. Maybe that will help.,2024-09-03 21:57:06
10129,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,"Great, let's set clear deadlines for each task so we know who's doing what and when it’s due.",2024-09-03 22:01:06
10130,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,"Agreed. That way, we can track our progress and make adjustments if needed.",2024-09-03 22:10:06
10131,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_2,"Thanks for being flexible, guys. I don't want to let you down.",2024-09-03 22:16:06
10132,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_1,"We all want to do well, so let's just communicate better and support each other.",2024-09-03 22:17:06
10133,deescalatory_conversation_102,speaker_3,Exactly. Teamwork,2024-09-03 22:26:06
10134,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking?,2024-09-03 21:17:09
10135,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,I didn't think it would be such a big deal. You never mentioned wanting it.,2024-09-03 21:25:09
10136,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,But you know I was saving it for a special occasion.,2024-09-03 21:29:09
10137,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,I didn't realize it was for something important. I'm really sorry about that.,2024-09-03 21:39:09
10138,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,It's fine. I just feel like you often ignore things that matter to me.,2024-09-03 21:44:09
10139,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,I understand your frustration. What can I do to make it up to you?,2024-09-03 21:48:09
10140,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,It would mean a lot if you could ask next time before taking something that isn't yours.,2024-09-03 21:52:09
10141,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I can do that. And I'll make sure to replace the cake.",2024-09-03 21:56:09
10142,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_1,That would be nice. Thank you for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:04:09
10143,deescalatory_conversation_103,speaker_2,No problem. I value our friendship and don't want something small to come between us.,2024-09-03 22:10:09
10144,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you went ahead with the project without me?,2024-09-03 21:20:13
10145,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,I thought it would be faster if I just handled it quickly by myself.,2024-09-03 21:29:13
10146,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,But we agreed we'd collaborate on it. It's not fair to leave me out like that.,2024-09-03 21:33:13
10147,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"I know, but we were running out of time and you were busy with your other commitments.",2024-09-03 21:36:13
10148,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,You should have at least asked me or informed me before going solo.,2024-09-03 21:41:13
10149,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated my plan. I didn't handle that well.,2024-09-03 21:43:13
10150,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"I understand that you were trying to help, but it makes me feel undermined.",2024-09-03 21:51:13
10151,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention at all. How can we move forward on this together?",2024-09-03 21:57:13
10152,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,Let's review what you've done so far and see where we can adjust or add inputs from my side.,2024-09-03 22:01:13
10153,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,That sounds good. I could definitely use your insights to improve the project.,2024-09-03 22:08:13
10154,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"Great, and next time, let's stick to our plan and keep each other in the loop.",2024-09-03 22:09:13
10155,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_2,"Deal. We’re a team, and I’ll make sure we work as one going forward.",2024-09-03 22:15:13
10156,deescalatory_conversation_104,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Let's get started on finishing this up.",2024-09-03 22:25:13
10157,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"Why did you take Marianne's design without asking her, Peter?",2024-09-03 21:24:17
10158,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, she wasn't even using it.",2024-09-03 21:29:17
10159,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_3,"Peter, it's not about whether she was using it or not. It's about respect and communication.",2024-09-03 21:34:17
10160,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"I get that, but we were on a tight deadline, and I thought she'd be okay with it if it helped the team.",2024-09-03 21:35:17
10161,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"It's true that we're in a crunch, but we still need to respect each other's work. Did you even consider asking her first?",2024-09-03 21:36:17
10162,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"Honestly, I thought it would just slow things down.",2024-09-03 21:37:17
10163,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_3,It probably would have only taken a minute to ask. This situation has now taken much more time to resolve.,2024-09-03 21:38:17
10164,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"Okay, maybe I should have asked. Can we just move forward and figure out how to meet the deadline now?",2024-09-03 21:44:17
10165,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_1,"We can move forward, as long as we all agree to communicate better from now on.",2024-09-03 21:51:17
10166,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's split up the tasks more clearly so we know who's responsible for what.,2024-09-03 21:58:17
10167,deescalatory_conversation_105,speaker_2,"Alright, I agree. I'll make sure to check in with everyone before using their work in the future.",2024-09-03 22:03:17
10168,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for our group project meeting, Sam? We really needed your input.",2024-09-03 21:25:20
10169,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,"I told you I had a lot of work to do for another class, Ruby. It's not like I did it on purpose.",2024-09-03 21:33:20
10170,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"I get that you're busy, but we had a deadline. It's not fair to the rest of us.",2024-09-03 21:37:20
10171,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,"Okay, maybe I could have managed my time better. But why didn't anyone remind me about the meeting?",2024-09-03 21:38:20
10172,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_3,"Sam, we sent reminders on our group chat. We can't keep chasing you.",2024-09-03 21:41:20
10173,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,"Sorry, I didn't see those messages. My notifications have been off this week.",2024-09-03 21:49:20
10174,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"We understand things come up, Sam. Could you check the chat more frequently going forward?",2024-09-03 21:53:20
10175,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,I will. Can we figure out how to divide the remaining tasks so we stay on track?,2024-09-03 21:56:20
10176,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_3,Good idea. Let's list what needs to be done and set mini-deadlines.,2024-09-03 21:58:20
10177,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"Perfect. I'll handle the research, and Tina can do the slides. Sam, can you work on the summary?",2024-09-03 22:03:20
10178,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,"Sure, I can do that. Let's check in again mid-week to see our progress.",2024-09-03 22:12:20
10179,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_3,Sounds like a plan. Let's make sure we communicate better this time.,2024-09-03 22:15:20
10180,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks, everyone. We got this.",2024-09-03 22:17:20
10181,deescalatory_conversation_106,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. Let's,2024-09-03 22:19:20
10182,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead with the project without consulting me, Sam.",2024-09-03 21:22:23
10183,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"Alex, I thought we agreed on the basic outline already.",2024-09-03 21:31:23
10184,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,"We agreed on the outline, but not on the execution. You changed a lot of things.",2024-09-03 21:35:23
10185,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but I didn't think those changes were major.",2024-09-03 21:44:23
10186,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,They were major to me. I felt completely sidelined.,2024-09-03 21:53:23
10187,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,How can we fix this? What changes specifically did you feel were too big?,2024-09-03 21:54:23
10188,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,"The introduction part, and the data analysis section. They don't align with the initial research we discussed.",2024-09-03 21:55:23
10189,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"Okay, let's go over those sections together and see how we can adjust them.",2024-09-03 22:03:23
10190,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,That would help. I appreciate you being open to discussing this.,2024-09-03 22:08:23
10191,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"Of course, Alex. I want this project to reflect both of our inputs.",2024-09-03 22:16:23
10192,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,Maybe we can set up a regular check-in so we don't end up here again?,2024-09-03 22:26:23
10193,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,That's a great idea. How about we meet every Tuesday to review progress?,2024-09-03 22:31:23
10194,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_1,"Sounds good to me. Thanks for understanding, Sam.",2024-09-03 22:41:23
10195,deescalatory_conversation_107,speaker_2,"No problem, Alex. Let's make this project something we're both proud of.",2024-09-03 22:44:23
10196,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you took credit for my idea during the meeting, Matt.",2024-09-03 21:21:27
10197,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,"Sarah, I didn't mean to take credit. I brought it up because I thought it would help the team move forward faster.",2024-09-03 21:29:27
10198,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,But you didn't mention that it was my idea. It made me look like I wasn't contributing.,2024-09-03 21:38:27
10199,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,You're right. I should have acknowledged your contribution. I'm sorry about that.,2024-09-03 21:46:27
10200,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,"I appreciate the apology, but it still feels unfair. This isn't the first time this has happened.",2024-09-03 21:51:27
10201,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,I understand your frustration. Can we find a way to ensure this doesn't happen again in the future?,2024-09-03 22:00:27
10202,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,Maybe we could agree to mention the origin of the ideas in our meetings.,2024-09-03 22:09:27
10203,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,That sounds fair. It's important we all get the credit we deserve. I'll make sure to do that from now on.,2024-09-03 22:19:27
10204,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,"Thanks, Matt. I just want to feel like my work is being recognized.",2024-09-03 22:25:27
10205,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,I get that. Let's keep the communication open so this doesn't create any more issues between us.,2024-09-03 22:27:27
10206,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_1,Agreed. I'll also try to speak up more so my contributions are clear.,2024-09-03 22:28:27
10207,deescalatory_conversation_108,speaker_2,"Perfect. We're a team, and we should make sure everyone feels valued.",2024-09-03 22:36:27
10208,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,"I can't believe you submitted the project without telling me, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:18:33
10209,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,"I thought it was urgent, Tom. We were running out of time, and you weren't answering your phone.",2024-09-03 21:28:33
10210,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,But I was working on the final slides! You knew I was making some last-minute edits.,2024-09-03 21:32:33
10211,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,I didn't realize you were still making changes. I saw the deadline was approaching and didn't want us to miss it.,2024-09-03 21:37:33
10212,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,"Well, now the presentation looks incomplete. It's missing some key points I wanted to include.",2024-09-03 21:46:33
10213,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,I'm really sorry about that. Can you tell me specifically what was missing? Maybe we can email the professor about updating it.,2024-09-03 21:56:33
10214,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,It was the statistical analysis section. I had finalized the graphs and just needed a few more minutes.,2024-09-03 22:06:33
10215,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,I see. I didn't know you were working on that—I should have checked with you first. Let's explain the situation to the professor together.,2024-09-03 22:10:33
10216,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,"That might work. I still feel frustrated, but if we both communicate, maybe they'll understand.",2024-09-03 22:16:33
10217,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Next time, let's make sure we have a plan for last-minute edits and deadlines. We can set specific check-ins.",2024-09-03 22:17:33
10218,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_1,Agreed. Thanks for being open to fixing this. We'll handle it better next time for sure.,2024-09-03 22:24:33
10219,deescalatory_conversation_109,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's draft that email together now so we can send it off and hopefully get everything sorted,2024-09-03 22:33:33
10220,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pick me for the group project, Emily.",2024-09-03 21:22:36
10221,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,"Look, Jack, it wasn't personal. We just thought Sarah's skills would suit the project better.",2024-09-03 21:30:36
10222,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,"But I have the same skills as Sarah! We've worked together before, and you know I'm reliable.",2024-09-03 21:33:36
10223,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,"I know you're reliable, Jack. It's just that this project involves a lot of graphic design, and Sarah's really good at that.",2024-09-03 21:43:36
10224,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,You could've at least talked to me about it beforehand. Now I feel left out and undervalued.,2024-09-03 21:52:36
10225,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,"You're right, we should've communicated better. I'm sorry about that. Maybe we can find a way for you to contribute?",2024-09-03 21:57:36
10226,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,Like what? The team roster is already full.,2024-09-03 22:03:36
10227,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,"True, but we could definitely use some help on the research side. You've always been great at gathering data and organizing it.",2024-09-03 22:05:36
10228,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,So you want me to do the grunt work while Sarah gets all the credit?,2024-09-03 22:12:36
10229,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,"No, it's not about credit. It's about making the project the best it can be. Your research will be crucial to our success.",2024-09-03 22:19:36
10230,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,I just wish I felt more included in the decision-making process.,2024-09-03 22:20:36
10231,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_2,"Honestly, that’s fair. Let's make a deal: next project, we'll sit down and plan out the roles together.",2024-09-03 22:24:36
10232,deescalatory_conversation_110,speaker_1,"Alright,",2024-09-03 22:28:36
10233,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,Why did you decide to go with that marketing strategy without consulting us?,2024-09-03 21:25:40
10234,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_2,I thought it was the best option given the timeframe we had. I didn't realize it would be an issue.,2024-09-03 21:35:40
10235,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,We should have had a team discussion before making such a big decision.,2024-09-03 21:45:40
10236,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_2,I understand that now. How can we fix this moving forward?,2024-09-03 21:47:40
10237,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,Let's set up a meeting to revisit the strategy and gather everyone's input.,2024-09-03 21:52:40
10238,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_2,That sounds good. I appreciate your willingness to work through this.,2024-09-03 21:59:40
10239,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,Thanks. I'll send out a meeting invite so we can discuss all potential plans.,2024-09-03 22:02:40
10240,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_2,"Perfect. I'll make sure to come prepared with my data to support the original decision, too.",2024-09-03 22:11:40
10241,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,"Great, that way we can compare all the options with the full information available.",2024-09-03 22:12:40
10242,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_2,Exactly. This should help us make a more informed and collective decision.,2024-09-03 22:20:40
10243,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's aim to communicate more effectively from now on.,2024-09-03 22:25:40
10244,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_2,"Yes, I'll make sure to check in before making decisions like this in the future.",2024-09-03 22:33:40
10245,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_1,I'm glad we're on the same page. This way we can avoid misunderstandings and work better as a team.,2024-09-03 22:39:40
10246,deescalatory_conversation_111,speaker_2,Absolutely. Looking forward to our meeting.,2024-09-03 22:49:40
10247,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Maria? I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:16:43
10248,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,"Look, Alex, I didn't see you. I was trying to go for the basket myself.",2024-09-03 21:19:43
10249,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,You always do this. You think you can win the game on your own.,2024-09-03 21:26:43
10250,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,"I'm not trying to win it alone, okay? I just thought it was the best move at the time.",2024-09-03 21:36:43
10251,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,"Well, next time, look around for your teammates. We're all in this together.",2024-09-03 21:45:43
10252,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,You're right. I'll try to be more aware of everyone's positioning. Can we move past this?,2024-09-03 21:50:43
10253,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,"Yeah, fine. Let's just focus on how we can improve for the next game.",2024-09-03 21:53:43
10254,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,Agreed. Maybe we should spend some extra time practicing our passes.,2024-09-03 22:03:43
10255,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,Good idea. And communication. We need to talk more on the court.,2024-09-03 22:10:43
10256,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,Totally. Let's make sure everyone knows to call out when they're open.,2024-09-03 22:15:43
10257,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,Deal. And I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier.,2024-09-03 22:21:43
10258,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_2,No worries. I'm sorry too. We got this next game.,2024-09-03 22:22:43
10259,deescalatory_conversation_112,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let's show them what a real team looks like.,2024-09-03 22:24:43
10260,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,"Marcus, you can't keep missing deadlines for the project. We’re all relying on you to do your part.",2024-09-03 21:17:47
10261,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,"I know, Tasha. I’ve been swamped with other work. But I’m really trying.",2024-09-03 21:25:47
10262,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,"I get that you’re busy, but we’re all busy. We need to find a way to make this work.",2024-09-03 21:29:47
10263,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,You’re right. Maybe I should have spoken up earlier. Can we try splitting some of the tasks?,2024-09-03 21:36:47
10264,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,What tasks specifically do you think you need help with?,2024-09-03 21:40:47
10265,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,"The data analysis has been really time-consuming. If someone could help me with that, it would make a big difference.",2024-09-03 21:44:47
10266,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,"Okay, how about I take on some of the data analysis? I can spare a few hours each day to assist.",2024-09-03 21:45:47
10267,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,"That would be amazing. With that help, I can focus on compiling the final report.",2024-09-03 21:50:47
10268,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,Great! Let’s make a new timeline to ensure we’re all on the same page moving forward.,2024-09-03 21:59:47
10269,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll draft a revised schedule and we can review it together tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:03:47
10270,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_1,"Perfect. Thanks for addressing this, Marcus. Let’s keep communication open so we can avoid this happening again.",2024-09-03 22:06:47
10271,deescalatory_conversation_113,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for understanding and stepping in, Tasha.",2024-09-03 22:13:47
10272,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_1,"Jake, you missed another rehearsal. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:23:50
10273,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_2,"Jen, I told you I had a lot of homework. And it's not like I don't know my lines.",2024-09-03 21:28:50
10274,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_1,"I understand you have homework, but we're all juggling responsibilities. The play needs everyone to be present.",2024-09-03 21:36:50
10275,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_2,"I feel like I'm being singled out, though. Other people miss sometimes too.",2024-09-03 21:38:50
10276,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_1,"It's not about singling you out, Jake. We just want to make sure the play is as good as it can be. Is there anything we can do to help you manage your schedule?",2024-09-03 21:45:50
10277,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_2,I guess I haven't really figured out my time management yet. Maybe I could work on that.,2024-09-03 21:49:50
10278,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_1,That sounds like a good start. Maybe we can set up a study group during our breaks so we can all help each other out.,2024-09-03 21:53:50
10279,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_2,That could work. And I'll try harder to make it to every rehearsal. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:02:50
10280,deescalatory_conversation_114,speaker_1,"Absolutely, Jake. We're all in this together. Let's make this play a success.",2024-09-03 22:10:50
10281,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,"Why did you use my design without asking me, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:24:53
10282,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,"I didn't realize it was such a big deal, Maria. It fit what we needed.",2024-09-03 21:30:53
10283,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,It's not just about fitting the need. It's about respecting each other's work.,2024-09-03 21:34:53
10284,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,"I understand that now, but we were running out of time, and it seemed urgent.",2024-09-03 21:44:53
10285,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,We could have discussed it together. You know how much effort I put into that design.,2024-09-03 21:49:53
10286,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,You're right. I should have asked for your approval first. I apologize.,2024-09-03 21:52:53
10287,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,"Thanks for admitting that. Next time, let's make sure we consult each other, okay?",2024-09-03 21:59:53
10288,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,Absolutely. I value your input and don't want to overlook it again.,2024-09-03 22:02:53
10289,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,Great. Let's focus on improving the project now. We can make it even better together.,2024-09-03 22:10:53
10290,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,That sounds perfect. I appreciate you being open to resolving this.,2024-09-03 22:13:53
10291,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_1,Teamwork is important. Let's keep supporting each other moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:23:53
10292,deescalatory_conversation_115,speaker_2,Agreed. We've got this. Let's finish this project strong!,2024-09-03 22:33:53
10293,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,Why did you delete the project folder without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:17:57
10294,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,I didn't realize it was still needed. I thought we were done with that.,2024-09-03 21:20:57
10295,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,We weren't. All of my notes and files were in there.,2024-09-03 21:21:57
10296,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,I'm sorry about that. I genuinely thought we had moved on.,2024-09-03 21:27:57
10297,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,It's not just about the project. It's about ignoring my input.,2024-09-03 21:29:57
10298,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,I understand. It was not my intention to disregard your work.,2024-09-03 21:37:57
10299,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,How are we going to recover all that lost information now?,2024-09-03 21:39:57
10300,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,Maybe we can check if there's a backup on the server?,2024-09-03 21:45:57
10301,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,"I'll contact IT immediately to find out. But going forward, let's communicate better.",2024-09-03 21:46:57
10302,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to double-check with you before making any major changes.,2024-09-03 21:54:57
10303,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_1,Great. And I'll make sure to keep a personal backup just in case. Can we work on this together now?,2024-09-03 21:59:57
10304,deescalatory_conversation_116,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's work together and prevent something like this from happening again.",2024-09-03 22:02:57
10305,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't tell me about the project deadline being moved up!,2024-09-03 21:23:00
10306,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,I just found out myself and I was going to tell you. Let's figure out how to manage this.,2024-09-03 21:30:00
10307,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,It's not the first time something like this has happened. It always feels like I'm the last to know.,2024-09-03 21:31:00
10308,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,I understand how frustrating that must be. How about we set up a better communication system?,2024-09-03 21:36:00
10309,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,"Maybe, but what's the point if the information isn't shared on time?",2024-09-03 21:44:00
10310,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,You're right. We need to ensure timely updates. Let's agree on a quick daily check-in to keep everyone in the loop.,2024-09-03 21:45:00
10311,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,That sounds like it could help. But we need more than just check-ins; we need to trust that everyone is committed.,2024-09-03 21:46:00
10312,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,"Absolutely, trust is essential. How about we also set some ground rules for prompt information sharing?",2024-09-03 21:55:00
10313,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,"Fine, but everyone has to stick to it. Can we also address any delays immediately?",2024-09-03 22:05:00
10314,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,"Yes, that's fair. Let's hold each other accountable. If there's a delay, we discuss it right away and find solutions.",2024-09-03 22:08:00
10315,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,"Alright, I can agree to that. Let's try this new approach and see how it goes.",2024-09-03 22:11:00
10316,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_2,Thanks for being open to finding a solution. I'll make sure to communicate any updates as soon as I get them.,2024-09-03 22:16:00
10317,deescalatory_conversation_117,speaker_1,And I'll do the,2024-09-03 22:18:00
10318,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,Why did you change the project design without consulting me?,2024-09-03 21:26:03
10319,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,"I didn't think you'd mind. The deadline is close, and I thought it would make things easier.",2024-09-03 21:36:03
10320,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,But we agreed to make decisions together. This isn't just your project.,2024-09-03 21:40:03
10321,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,"I get that, but I saw a way to improve our chances. Would you at least take a look at the changes?",2024-09-03 21:48:03
10322,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,"Sure, I can do that. But we need to trust each other and operate on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:52:03
10323,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,You're right. How about we sit down and review the new design together?,2024-09-03 22:00:03
10324,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Can we also discuss why you felt the changes were necessary?,2024-09-03 22:07:03
10325,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,Absolutely. I thought the original design had some flaws and wanted to address them quickly.,2024-09-03 22:17:03
10326,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,"Okay, let's discuss those points and see if we can integrate both our ideas.",2024-09-03 22:24:03
10327,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_2,Great. I'm confident we can improve the project together.,2024-09-03 22:26:03
10328,deescalatory_conversation_118,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's get started.,2024-09-03 22:31:03
10329,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,Why did you change the layout of the presentation without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:21:07
10330,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,I thought it needed to look more professional; the original seemed too basic.,2024-09-03 21:26:07
10331,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,But we had already agreed on a layout and splitting responsibilities. You should have discussed this with me first.,2024-09-03 21:33:07
10332,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,"I understand, but I was trying to help us impress the client. It wasn't meant to undermine your work.",2024-09-03 21:43:07
10333,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,"I appreciate that you want to make a good impression, but it feels like you didn't trust my contribution.",2024-09-03 21:48:07
10334,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,That wasn't my intention at all. I do respect your work. I should have communicated my ideas first.,2024-09-03 21:52:07
10335,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,Thank you for saying that. I think it would be best if we reviewed the changes together now.,2024-09-03 21:56:07
10336,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's go through it and make sure we're both happy with the final presentation.",2024-09-03 22:06:07
10337,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,"Okay, how about we start with the introduction slide? It seemed too cluttered to me.",2024-09-03 22:15:07
10338,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,"Sure, I was aiming for a detailed overview, but I can see how it might come off as cluttered. Let's simplify it.",2024-09-03 22:23:07
10339,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,"Great. And for the middle section, I noticed you added some new graphs. Can we discuss their relevance?",2024-09-03 22:32:07
10340,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_2,Of course. I added them to show more recent data trends. Let's see which ones are really necessary.,2024-09-03 22:42:07
10341,deescalatory_conversation_119,speaker_1,"Perfect. This way, we're both contributing and",2024-09-03 22:51:07
10342,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,I don't understand why you didn't pass me the ball during the game today.,2024-09-03 21:21:11
10343,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, and I was trying to drive to the hoop.",2024-09-03 21:26:11
10344,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,"But I was right there, calling for it! We could have made the shot together.",2024-09-03 21:30:11
10345,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"I get that, but from my angle, there was too much traffic. I didn't want to risk a turnover.",2024-09-03 21:32:11
10346,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,"Maybe, but it feels like you don't trust my abilities to make the play.",2024-09-03 21:35:11
10347,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"It's not that, honestly. I was just caught up in the moment and made a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:38:11
10348,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,"Alright, but can we work on communication or signals for situations like that?",2024-09-03 21:46:11
10349,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's come up with something that ensures we're both aware of each other's position.,2024-09-03 21:54:11
10350,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,Sounds good. I just want us to be a cohesive team and make better plays.,2024-09-03 21:56:11
10351,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"Me too. I value your skills, and I know we can play off of each other well.",2024-09-03 22:01:11
10352,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,"Cool, let's talk to the coach about setting up a few extra practice sessions?",2024-09-03 22:02:11
10353,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,Great idea. I'll support that. We can get some solid strategies in place.,2024-09-03 22:08:11
10354,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's make the next game our best one yet.,2024-09-03 22:09:11
10355,deescalatory_conversation_120,speaker_2,"Agreed. We're on the same team, and that's what matters.",2024-09-03 22:14:11
10356,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"Why did you take my shifts without asking me first, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:19:14
10357,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"I didn’t think you’d mind, Sarah. I needed the extra cash.",2024-09-03 21:24:14
10358,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"Well, I do mind. You know I rely on those hours too.",2024-09-03 21:28:14
10359,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"I get that, but I was in a tight spot this month. Couldn’t you have just taken someone else's shifts?",2024-09-03 21:32:14
10360,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"The schedule was already tight. Plus, it's not just about the money. It's the principle of asking first.",2024-09-03 21:41:14
10361,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"Alright, I see your point. I should’ve talked to you before making any changes.",2024-09-03 21:46:14
10362,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,"Thanks for understanding. Just talk to me next time, okay?",2024-09-03 21:52:14
10363,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_2,"Sure thing. And if you ever need extra hours, just let me know too. We can work it out together.",2024-09-03 22:02:14
10364,deescalatory_conversation_121,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let’s make sure we’re on the same page from now on.,2024-09-03 22:09:14
10365,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,Why did you suddenly quit the project without telling any of us?,2024-09-03 21:22:17
10366,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,I felt like no one was listening to my ideas anyway. What's the point?,2024-09-03 21:23:17
10367,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,"We were listening, but you never gave us a chance to discuss them together.",2024-09-03 21:25:17
10368,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,That's because you always shut me down the moment I bring them up.,2024-09-03 21:35:17
10369,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_3,Let's take a step back. Can we pinpoint where the communication broke down?,2024-09-03 21:38:17
10370,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,Maybe we didn't make enough effort to hear everyone out equally.,2024-09-03 21:44:17
10371,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,I didn't feel like my contributions were valued.,2024-09-03 21:54:17
10372,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_3,I see that. What specifically made you feel that way?,2024-09-03 21:58:17
10373,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,"Every time I brought up an idea, it got dismissed or ignored.",2024-09-03 22:08:17
10374,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,I didn't realize that was happening. Can you give us an example?,2024-09-03 22:11:17
10375,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,Remember the marketing plan I suggested? It was just brushed off without any discussion.,2024-09-03 22:15:17
10376,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_3,That was a great idea. Why didn't we discuss it more?,2024-09-03 22:18:17
10377,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,"I thought we were going in a different direction, but I see now we should have at least talked about it.",2024-09-03 22:23:17
10378,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,Exactly. I just wanted to be heard.,2024-09-03 22:33:17
10379,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_3,How can we make sure everyone feels heard from now on?,2024-09-03 22:41:17
10380,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_1,Maybe setting specific times in meetings for each person to present their ideas?,2024-09-03 22:43:17
10381,deescalatory_conversation_122,speaker_2,That could work. I'd appreciate a fair chance to,2024-09-03 22:52:17
10382,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,I don't understand why you didn't tell me about the meeting being rescheduled.,2024-09-03 21:23:22
10383,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,I thought you already knew. The email was sent to everyone in the group.,2024-09-03 21:30:22
10384,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,I didn't see the email. Could you have at least mentioned it during lunch?,2024-09-03 21:35:22
10385,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, it slipped my mind. I was pretty busy with that project deadline.",2024-09-03 21:40:22
10386,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,"It seems like this keeps happening. Every time there's a change, I'm the last to know.",2024-09-03 21:49:22
10387,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,I get that it’s frustrating. Maybe we can set up a better system for keeping everyone informed?,2024-09-03 21:57:22
10388,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,That might help. Can we agree to message each other directly for important updates?,2024-09-03 22:06:22
10389,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll start making that a habit. Anything else that's been bothering you?,2024-09-03 22:08:22
10390,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,"Now that you mention it, the task assignments have also been confusing lately.",2024-09-03 22:11:22
10391,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,Let’s arrange a quick weekly check-in to clarify tasks. Does that sound good?,2024-09-03 22:17:22
10392,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,"Yes, that sounds perfect. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:22:22
10393,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_2,No problem. I’m glad we talked this through. Let's make sure we're both on the same page moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:31:22
10394,deescalatory_conversation_123,speaker_1,Agreed. Thanks for listening.,2024-09-03 22:40:22
10395,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you pass me the ball in the last quarter?",2024-09-03 21:20:25
10396,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,I didn't see you open. I thought you were covered.,2024-09-03 21:23:25
10397,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,Seriously? I was wide open! This isn't the first time you've done this.,2024-09-03 21:27:25
10398,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,"Look, it was a high-pressure situation. I made a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:31:25
10399,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,Quick decision? We lost because of that!,2024-09-03 21:39:25
10400,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,"I know you're frustrated, but blaming me isn't helping.",2024-09-03 21:41:25
10401,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,"I'm not just blaming you, I'm saying we need to communicate better.",2024-09-03 21:50:25
10402,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,I agree. Maybe we should work on signals or something during practice.,2024-09-03 21:53:25
10403,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,"Yeah, but it felt like you weren't even looking my way.",2024-09-03 21:58:25
10404,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,I'll pay more attention next time. Can we discuss this with the coach?,2024-09-03 22:03:25
10405,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,Sure. We need a better game plan for these situations.,2024-09-03 22:08:25
10406,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,"Definitely. I want us to win too, you know.",2024-09-03 22:15:25
10407,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_1,"Okay, let's focus on improving together, then.",2024-09-03 22:19:25
10408,deescalatory_conversation_124,speaker_2,"Agreed. We're a team, after all.",2024-09-03 22:20:25
10409,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you're ignoring my emails, Sarah. We have to finalize the budget proposal by tomorrow.",2024-09-03 21:18:29
10410,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,"I'm not ignoring them, John. I'm just swamped with the marketing report deadline.",2024-09-03 21:25:29
10411,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,But the budget proposal is crucial too. Can't you prioritize it for a little while?,2024-09-03 21:28:29
10412,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,"I get it, I really do. I'm just balancing too many tasks right now. Can we allocate some tasks, so it’s more manageable?",2024-09-03 21:29:29
10413,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,"Okay, maybe I can take over the initial draft of the marketing report if you can focus on the budget proposal for a bit.",2024-09-03 21:38:29
10414,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,That sounds fair. It’s a good idea to split the tasks. How about we check in on each other’s progress at noon?,2024-09-03 21:39:29
10415,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's do a quick call at noon then. And let’s set some realistic deadlines for each segment of the projects.,2024-09-03 21:49:29
10416,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,That makes sense. I think we'll both be less stressed if we have clear milestones.,2024-09-03 21:59:29
10417,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_1,Absolutely. Thanks for being flexible about this. We’ll get through it together.,2024-09-03 22:04:29
10418,deescalatory_conversation_125,speaker_2,"No problem, John. Let’s make sure both the proposal and the report are top-notch.",2024-09-03 22:10:29
10419,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,Why did you tell Coach that I skipped practice yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:20:32
10420,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to get you in trouble, but Coach asked directly and I didn't want to lie.",2024-09-03 21:29:32
10421,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,You could've just said you didn't know! Now I'm benched for the next game.,2024-09-03 21:39:32
10422,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but honesty is important. I thought you'd prefer that over me lying.",2024-09-03 21:48:32
10423,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,But now the whole team thinks I’m unreliable. That’s not fair.,2024-09-03 21:56:32
10424,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_3,"Hey, it's not that bad. Coach will give you another chance if you show up and work hard.",2024-09-03 22:03:32
10425,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"It's easy for you to say, you're not the one being punished.",2024-09-03 22:12:32
10426,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,I get how you feel. Maybe we can talk to Coach together and explain the situation?,2024-09-03 22:15:32
10427,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"Fine, but what am I supposed to say? That I had a family emergency?",2024-09-03 22:16:32
10428,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_3,"If it’s true, just be honest about why you missed practice. Coach respects sincerity.",2024-09-03 22:24:32
10429,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"I don’t think Coach will care, but I guess it's worth a try.",2024-09-03 22:25:32
10430,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_2,And we're in this together. We're a team; let's support each other.,2024-09-03 22:30:32
10431,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_1,"Alright, thanks for sticking with me. Let's go talk to Coach now.",2024-09-03 22:40:32
10432,deescalatory_conversation_126,speaker_3,"Yeah, let's go. We've got your back.",2024-09-03 22:50:32
10433,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,"Why did you tear down my poster, Ben? I spent hours on that!",2024-09-03 21:25:35
10434,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to, Sarah. It was in the spot I needed for my project layout.",2024-09-03 21:32:35
10435,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,You could've asked me before just ripping it down. That was really disrespectful.,2024-09-03 21:39:35
10436,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I did it without thinking. I should have consulted you first. How can we fix this?",2024-09-03 21:42:35
10437,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,Maybe we can find a way to display both our projects together. Could you help me remake my poster?,2024-09-03 21:45:35
10438,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"Sure, I'd be happy to help. Let's find a spot where both can be seen clearly.",2024-09-03 21:52:35
10439,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_1,"Thanks, Ben. I appreciate it. Next time, let's talk before doing something like this.",2024-09-03 21:53:35
10440,deescalatory_conversation_127,speaker_2,"Definitely, Sarah. Communication is key. Let's get started on that poster together.",2024-09-03 22:03:35
10441,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,"Why did you submit our group project without telling anyone, Emily?",2024-09-03 21:20:38
10442,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"I had to, Jake. The deadline was approaching, and no one else was making any progress.",2024-09-03 21:30:38
10443,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_3,"Emily, that may be true, but we were all working on different parts. You didn't even check if we were ready.",2024-09-03 21:33:38
10444,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,I assumed everyone was behind schedule since I hadn't heard from anyone.,2024-09-03 21:36:38
10445,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,But you could have at least sent a message or something. We were all online.,2024-09-03 21:40:38
10446,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"I understand that now, but I was worried we wouldn't make the deadline at all.",2024-09-03 21:47:38
10447,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_3,"We appreciate your concern, but we need to work as a team. Can we agree on better communication next time?",2024-09-03 21:50:38
10448,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"Yes, I see your point. I'll make sure to keep everyone in the loop from now on.",2024-09-03 21:55:38
10449,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,"Thanks, Emily. Let's try to coordinate more openly moving forward. We all want the same outcome.",2024-09-03 22:03:38
10450,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's set up a group chat or a regular check-in so this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:08:38
10451,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_2,"That sounds like a solid plan. Thanks for understanding, guys.",2024-09-03 22:10:38
10452,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_1,No problem. We all just want to do our best.,2024-09-03 22:20:38
10453,deescalatory_conversation_128,speaker_3,Exactly. Let's finish strong on our next project.,2024-09-03 22:27:38
10454,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"Why did you take my laptop without asking, Matt?",2024-09-03 21:24:41
10455,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"I really needed it for my project, Sarah. I thought you wouldn't mind.",2024-09-03 21:26:41
10456,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"Of course I mind! My work is on this laptop too, you should have asked first.",2024-09-03 21:36:41
10457,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have asked. I just panicked because I was running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:42:41
10458,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"If you had asked, I could have figured something out. Now I'm behind on my own work.",2024-09-03 21:48:41
10459,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"I understand, and I’m really sorry. How can I make it up to you?",2024-09-03 21:58:41
10460,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"For starters, return the laptop right now. And maybe you could help me with my project to catch up.",2024-09-03 22:07:41
10461,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll get it back to you immediately and help you all evening if you need.",2024-09-03 22:15:41
10462,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_1,"Thanks, Matt. I appreciate it. Let's communicate better next time, okay?",2024-09-03 22:20:41
10463,deescalatory_conversation_129,speaker_2,"Deal, Sarah. I'll make sure to ask before borrowing anything in the future.",2024-09-03 22:25:41
10464,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you change the presentation slides without asking me first?",2024-09-03 21:21:44
10465,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,I thought the new design looked better. I didn't think it needed approval.,2024-09-03 21:22:44
10466,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,We agreed to consult each other on major changes. You didn't keep to that.,2024-09-03 21:32:44
10467,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,I see. I didn't realize it was a major change. Can you explain why it bothers you?,2024-09-03 21:35:44
10468,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,It’s not just about the design. It feels like you don’t value my input in our project.,2024-09-03 21:44:44
10469,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,I didn't intend to make you feel that way. What can we do to fix this?,2024-09-03 21:51:44
10470,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,Maybe we can set some clearer guidelines on what requires mutual agreement.,2024-09-03 21:53:44
10471,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'd definitely be on board with that. Do you have some ideas on these guidelines?,2024-09-03 21:55:44
10472,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,We could start by outlining which sections belong to whom and agree on a list of major elements that need joint approval.,2024-09-03 22:04:44
10473,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,Great idea. Maybe we can draft this list together tomorrow. Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 22:08:44
10474,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_1,"Yes, that works. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:16:44
10475,deescalatory_conversation_130,speaker_2,No problem. I appreciate you bringing this up. Let's make sure we're both on the same page moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:26:44
10476,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me about the project deadline change, Chris?",2024-09-03 21:17:47
10477,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,"I wasn't aware that I had to inform everyone, Sarah. I thought you'd check the email.",2024-09-03 21:25:47
10478,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,"Well, I missed the email, and now we're both in trouble. This could've been avoided.",2024-09-03 21:28:47
10479,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,"I'm sorry you missed it, but maybe we should have a backup system for important updates.",2024-09-03 21:33:47
10480,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,"Yeah, maybe you're right. But still, we should inform each other about such changes.",2024-09-03 21:42:47
10481,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's work on better communication.,2024-09-03 21:47:47
10482,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_1,"Okay, let's set up a shared calendar or something for deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:55:47
10483,deescalatory_conversation_131,speaker_2,Sounds good to me. We'll make sure this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:02:47
10484,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball during the last play, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:22:50
10485,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,"Sarah, I was trying to find an open spot. You were covered.",2024-09-03 21:25:50
10486,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,"But I had signaled I was ready to move, and you ignored it!",2024-09-03 21:28:50
10487,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,"Look, I'm sorry if I missed it. The pressure was high, and I had to make a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:33:50
10488,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,"Quick decision or not, we're a team. You should trust me to take the shot.",2024-09-03 21:39:50
10489,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,"You're right, Sarah. I should have trusted you more. Next time, I'll rely on you.",2024-09-03 21:40:50
10490,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. I guess I overreacted a bit too. We both want to win, after all.",2024-09-03 21:44:50
10491,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's focus on how we can work better together in the next game.,2024-09-03 21:51:50
10492,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,Agreed. Maybe we can practice some signals before the match?,2024-09-03 21:54:50
10493,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,That sounds like a great idea. Better communication will help us a lot.,2024-09-03 21:58:50
10494,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_1,"Definitely. Sorry for snapping at you, by the way.",2024-09-03 22:05:50
10495,deescalatory_conversation_132,speaker_2,"No worries, Sarah. We're all in this together. Let's keep our heads cool.",2024-09-03 22:14:50
10496,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,I can't believe you'd submit that group project without telling us first.,2024-09-03 21:26:54
10497,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,I thought you both trusted me to handle it. What's the problem?,2024-09-03 21:30:54
10498,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_3,The problem is you didn't include any of the changes we discussed last week.,2024-09-03 21:37:54
10499,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,"Yeah, we spent hours making those adjustments. Why did you ignore them?",2024-09-03 21:38:54
10500,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,I wasn't ignoring them. I thought the project was fine as it was. We were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:45:54
10501,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_3,But we agreed as a team to make those changes. You can't just decide on your own.,2024-09-03 21:55:54
10502,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,"Okay, I realize I made a decision without consulting you guys, and I'm sorry for that.",2024-09-03 22:00:54
10503,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,We just want to make sure our voices and contributions are respected.,2024-09-03 22:10:54
10504,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_3,Can we submit a revised version or talk to the professor about an extension?,2024-09-03 22:11:54
10505,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,That's a good idea. Let's approach the professor and explain the situation together.,2024-09-03 22:19:54
10506,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_1,"And moving forward, we need to communicate better and make decisions as a team.",2024-09-03 22:22:54
10507,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's make this a learning experience and improve our teamwork.,2024-09-03 22:27:54
10508,deescalatory_conversation_133,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll set up the meeting with the professor right away. Thank you both for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:32:54
10509,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,You never listen to what I have to say during our project meetings.,2024-09-03 21:22:57
10510,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"I do listen, but your ideas often don't fit within our deadline constraints.",2024-09-03 21:25:57
10511,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,How do you know if you don't even give them a chance?,2024-09-03 21:31:57
10512,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,What if we both wrote down our ideas before the meeting so they're considered equally?,2024-09-03 21:39:57
10513,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,"I guess that could work, but we'd need to actually go through them together.",2024-09-03 21:40:57
10514,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,Agreed. How about we set a specific time in the meeting for reviewing both of our ideas?,2024-09-03 21:47:57
10515,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Can we also make sure to keep things efficient so we don’t run over?,2024-09-03 21:57:57
10516,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"Absolutely, maybe we can limit the discussion time for each idea to a few minutes?",2024-09-03 21:58:57
10517,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,"Okay, deal. Maybe a timer could help us keep track.",2024-09-03 21:59:57
10518,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,Good idea. Let’s start this new approach at the next meeting and see how it goes.,2024-09-03 22:00:57
10519,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,"Alright, I’ll draft some ideas ahead of time and send them over to you.",2024-09-03 22:07:57
10520,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,I'll do the same. Thanks for working through this with me.,2024-09-03 22:13:57
10521,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_1,Thank you too. Looking forward to a more productive meeting.,2024-09-03 22:14:57
10522,deescalatory_conversation_134,speaker_2,"Same here, let's make this project a success together.",2024-09-03 22:18:57
10523,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball, Mark. We were so close to scoring!",2024-09-03 21:23:01
10524,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"I didn't see you, Jenny. I was focused on the defender in front of me.",2024-09-03 21:32:01
10525,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,But I was wide open! You should always check your surroundings before making a move.,2024-09-03 21:38:01
10526,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"I get that, but split-second decisions are hard in the moment. I'm sorry if I missed you.",2024-09-03 21:45:01
10527,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing isn't going to help us win the next game. Let's figure out what went wrong and improve.",2024-09-03 21:54:01
10528,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,"You're right, Coach. I just felt ignored out there.",2024-09-03 22:04:01
10529,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Jenny. I'll work on being more aware of my teammates.",2024-09-03 22:13:01
10530,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,"Thanks, Mark. I appreciate it. Let's just communicate better on the field.",2024-09-03 22:17:01
10531,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_3,"That's the spirit, team. Remember, we're all in this together. Let's go over our strategy again.",2024-09-03 22:19:01
10532,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_2,"Good idea, Coach. Jenny, can you suggest where I should be looking when I'm in that position next time?",2024-09-03 22:28:01
10533,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_1,"Sure, I'll show you some signals we can use to get each other's attention without losing focus on the game.",2024-09-03 22:35:01
10534,deescalatory_conversation_135,speaker_3,"Perfect. Let's practice those signals during our next drill. If we stick together and improve our communication, we'll be unstoppable.",2024-09-03 22:44:01
10535,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,"Mark, why didn't you tell me the project deadline was moved?",2024-09-03 21:21:05
10536,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,"I thought you knew, Sarah. It was mentioned in the team meeting last week.",2024-09-03 21:29:05
10537,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,"I wasn't in that meeting, remember? I was out sick.",2024-09-03 21:35:05
10538,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,"Oh, right. I guess I assumed someone would update you. My bad.",2024-09-03 21:38:05
10539,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,This isn't the first time something like this has happened. It's really messing up the workflow.,2024-09-03 21:40:05
10540,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,I get that. Maybe we need a better system for keeping everyone updated.,2024-09-03 21:46:05
10541,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,Agreed. Can we set up a shared calendar or something?,2024-09-03 21:47:05
10542,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,That's a good idea. Let's bring it up in the next team meeting.,2024-09-03 21:54:05
10543,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,"Thanks. I know we're all busy, but communication is key.",2024-09-03 21:59:05
10544,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,Definitely. I'll make sure to send out a summary email after meetings from now on.,2024-09-03 22:00:05
10545,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,"That would help a lot. I appreciate it, Mark.",2024-09-03 22:08:05
10546,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,No problem. Let's make sure this project gets back on track together.,2024-09-03 22:12:05
10547,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:18:05
10548,deescalatory_conversation_136,speaker_2,"Anytime, Sarah. We're a team, after all.",2024-09-03 22:25:05
10549,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,"I saw the final project outline you submitted, and it looks nothing like what we discussed.",2024-09-03 21:24:08
10550,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,I made a few tweaks based on some new ideas I had. Why are you upset?,2024-09-03 21:26:08
10551,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,"Those ""tweaks"" completely change the direction of our project. We had agreed on something different.",2024-09-03 21:33:08
10552,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,I thought these changes would improve our chances of getting a higher grade. Did I overstep?,2024-09-03 21:37:08
10553,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,"Yes, a bit. We should have talked about these changes first. Now we have to explain this to the professor.",2024-09-03 21:44:08
10554,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,You're right. I should have checked with you. Should we try to merge both our ideas together?,2024-09-03 21:46:08
10555,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,That sounds like a good compromise. Let's make sure we're both happy with the final product.,2024-09-03 21:55:08
10556,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,Agreed. When can we sit down and go over everything?,2024-09-03 22:03:08
10557,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,How about tomorrow afternoon? We can spend a few hours ironing out the details.,2024-09-03 22:09:08
10558,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_2,Tomorrow works for me. Thanks for understanding. I didn't mean to cause any issues.,2024-09-03 22:14:08
10559,deescalatory_conversation_137,speaker_1,"I know you had good intentions. Let's make this project the best it can be, together.",2024-09-03 22:17:08
10560,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,I can't believe you ditched practice again. You’re letting the whole team down.,2024-09-03 21:24:11
10561,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,"I had a ton of homework, okay? It wasn't intentional.",2024-09-03 21:31:11
10562,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,Everyone has homework. We all manage. You could have at least told us.,2024-09-03 21:40:11
10563,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,"I thought you’d understand, especially after I helped you with that project last week.",2024-09-03 21:42:11
10564,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,"Look, I appreciate that, but teamwork is important here. We need everyone to pitch in.",2024-09-03 21:51:11
10565,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,"I get that, but sometimes things come up. What do you want me to do?",2024-09-03 21:59:11
10566,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,Maybe just communicate better. Let us know what’s going on so we’re not caught off guard.,2024-09-03 22:05:11
10567,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,Fair enough. I’ll try to keep you posted in the future if something comes up.,2024-09-03 22:11:11
10568,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_1,Thanks. It just feels like we’re all putting in the effort and we need to trust that everyone else is too.,2024-09-03 22:18:11
10569,deescalatory_conversation_138,speaker_2,I understand. And I’ll do my best to be more reliable. Let’s make this work.,2024-09-03 22:22:11
10570,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for rehearsal again, Mike.",2024-09-03 21:25:14
10571,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"I told you, Sarah, I had an emergency at work!",2024-09-03 21:29:14
10572,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"An emergency every week though? The play is in two weeks, and you're the lead!",2024-09-03 21:37:14
10573,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"I know, but I really can't control when things get hectic at my job.",2024-09-03 21:43:14
10574,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,Could you at least text us when you're going to be late or miss?,2024-09-03 21:45:14
10575,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,You're right. I should keep the group informed. I'm sorry about that.,2024-09-03 21:50:14
10576,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"We just need to know what's going on, so we can adjust plans if needed.",2024-09-03 21:55:14
10577,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"Okay, I'll make sure to do that from now on.",2024-09-03 21:57:14
10578,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,"Thanks, Mike. Do you think you'll be able to make it for the rest of the rehearsals?",2024-09-03 22:07:14
10579,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,I’ll do my best. I'll talk to my boss and try to arrange my schedule better.,2024-09-03 22:08:14
10580,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,That would help a lot. We really want this play to be great.,2024-09-03 22:09:14
10581,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"I do too, Sarah. I'll make more of an effort, I promise.",2024-09-03 22:11:14
10582,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_1,Appreciate it. Let’s work together to make this a success.,2024-09-03 22:15:14
10583,deescalatory_conversation_139,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Let's nail this, team.",2024-09-03 22:18:14
10584,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"Jake, you can't expect me to redo the whole project just because you don't like the layout.",2024-09-03 21:27:19
10585,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,"Emily, it's not about liking or not, it’s about following the client’s branding guidelines.",2024-09-03 21:28:19
10586,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"I get that, but you didn’t even give any constructive feedback.",2024-09-03 21:34:19
10587,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,I said we need to incorporate their colors and fonts more consistently.,2024-09-03 21:40:19
10588,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"Fine, but you sent that feedback two days before the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:45:19
10589,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,"I realize that, but we need to make sure the final product meets the client’s standards.",2024-09-03 21:53:19
10590,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,Then let's work together to adjust it. What specific changes do you want to see?,2024-09-03 21:58:19
10591,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,Maybe we can start by revising the header and footer to match their style guide.,2024-09-03 22:03:19
10592,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,"Alright, we should list all the elements we need to update, so we don’t miss anything.",2024-09-03 22:07:19
10593,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll compile the guidelines and we can check off each requirement.,2024-09-03 22:17:19
10594,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,Perfect. And let's split the tasks to cover more ground. I'll handle the fonts and you take the colors?,2024-09-03 22:21:19
10595,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,Sounds good. Let’s also set up a quick review tomorrow morning to ensure we’re on track.,2024-09-03 22:25:19
10596,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_1,Deal. Thanks for working this out with me.,2024-09-03 22:29:19
10597,deescalatory_conversation_140,speaker_2,"No problem. We’re a team, after all.",2024-09-03 22:31:19
10598,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,"I don’t understand why you didn’t tell us you were dropping out of the project, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:24:24
10599,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"I didn't drop out, I just couldn’t make it to the last meeting. I had an emergency.",2024-09-03 21:30:24
10600,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_3,An emergency? You didn’t even send a message or anything.,2024-09-03 21:32:24
10601,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"I know, I should have informed you guys, but it was a family issue and it slipped my mind.",2024-09-03 21:38:24
10602,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,We were left scrambling to cover your part. It set us back a lot.,2024-09-03 21:42:24
10603,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,I’m really sorry; I realize now how much inconvenience this has caused.,2024-09-03 21:43:24
10604,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_3,"It would help if you could at least give us a heads-up next time—emergencies happen, but communication is crucial.",2024-09-03 21:46:24
10605,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I completely agree. I messed up on that front and I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.",2024-09-03 21:51:24
10606,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,Can you commit to attending our next meeting and catching up on your tasks?,2024-09-03 22:00:24
10607,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,"Yes, I’m committed. I’ll review what I missed and will be fully prepared for the next meeting.",2024-09-03 22:06:24
10608,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_3,"Alright, let's regroup and focus on getting back on track. We need all hands on deck for the final presentation.",2024-09-03 22:11:24
10609,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_1,Agreed. Let’s set up a mini session to assign any remaining tasks that need immediate attention.,2024-09-03 22:13:24
10610,deescalatory_conversation_141,speaker_2,Sounds good to me. I appreciate you guys being understanding,2024-09-03 22:16:24
10611,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,I saw your name on the group project and just had to ask—why haven't you done your part yet?,2024-09-03 21:20:28
10612,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,"I could ask the same, you barely contributed any notes last week.",2024-09-03 21:30:28
10613,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,"I've been swamped with my other coursework, but I still managed to gather some sources. What's your excuse?",2024-09-03 21:35:28
10614,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,"Honestly, I've had some personal stuff come up, but I'm starting to get it under control now. Why didn't you reach out for help if you were struggling?",2024-09-03 21:44:28
10615,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,"I guess I didn't think anyone else was struggling as much as I was. Look, can we just figure out how to split up the remaining work evenly?",2024-09-03 21:48:28
10616,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,"That's fair. How about I handle the data analysis since I have more free time this weekend, and you can focus on the presentation slides?",2024-09-03 21:57:28
10617,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,That works for me. Do you think we should check in with the rest of the team to make sure they're on board too?,2024-09-03 21:59:28
10618,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,Definitely. We should probably have a quick group call later today. I'll send out a message to see when everyone's available.,2024-09-03 22:01:28
10619,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,Great idea. Let's also make a shared document so we can track our progress and deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:03:28
10620,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_2,"Alright, I'll get that set up right after our call. Thanks for being open to sorting things out.",2024-09-03 22:04:28
10621,deescalatory_conversation_142,speaker_1,No problem. I'm glad we talked this through calmly. We can definitely pull this off,2024-09-03 22:06:28
10622,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_1,Why did you change the project proposal without even discussing it with me first?,2024-09-03 21:19:31
10623,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_2,I thought the changes were necessary to make it better. Why does it matter who did it?,2024-09-03 21:29:31
10624,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_1,"Because we're supposed to be a team, making decisions together. That's how we agreed to work.",2024-09-03 21:34:31
10625,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_2,"I get that, but sometimes you just have to make quick decisions. It’s not that big of a deal.",2024-09-03 21:39:31
10626,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_1,It is a big deal when it undermines our collaboration. What if the changes you made don't align with our goals?,2024-09-03 21:41:31
10627,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_2,"Okay, I can see where you're coming from. Maybe we should go over the changes together now?",2024-09-03 21:47:31
10628,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_1,"Yes, that sounds like a good idea. Let's review them and see how we can incorporate both of our inputs.",2024-09-03 21:51:31
10629,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_2,Great. I didn't mean to exclude you. Let's make sure this proposal really shines.,2024-09-03 21:57:31
10630,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_1,"I appreciate that. Moving forward, let's ensure we always consult each other before making significant changes.",2024-09-03 22:03:31
10631,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_2,Absolutely. Communication is key. I won't make that mistake again.,2024-09-03 22:12:31
10632,deescalatory_conversation_143,speaker_1,"Thanks for understanding. Now, let's get this proposal finalized.",2024-09-03 22:14:31
10633,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_1,Why did you take my project idea without even asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:18:34
10634,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal. We’re on the same team, aren't we?",2024-09-03 21:24:34
10635,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_1,It's a big deal to me. I spent a lot of time developing that idea.,2024-09-03 21:28:34
10636,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_2,I thought we could collaborate and make it better together.,2024-09-03 21:36:34
10637,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_1,Collaborate means you ask before you use someone else's work.,2024-09-03 21:38:34
10638,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have asked. I apologize for that. Can we figure out a way to work on this together?",2024-09-03 21:48:34
10639,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_1,"I appreciate the apology. Maybe we can brainstorm how to enhance the project, but I still need to get credit for the original idea.",2024-09-03 21:57:34
10640,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_2,"Absolutely, you deserve the credit. Let's sit down and see how we can combine our strengths to improve it.",2024-09-03 22:07:34
10641,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I just wanted to be included in the process.,2024-09-03 22:08:34
10642,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_2,"Understood. From now on, I'll make sure to communicate clearly and involve you in every step.",2024-09-03 22:12:34
10643,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's give this project our best effort.,2024-09-03 22:15:34
10644,deescalatory_conversation_144,speaker_2,Agreed. We’ll do great things together.,2024-09-03 22:16:34
10645,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball during the game, Alex? We lost because of that!",2024-09-03 21:19:38
10646,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, Jamie. The defense was tight, and I had to make a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:23:38
10647,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_1,But I was completely free! A simple pass could have turned the game around!,2024-09-03 21:32:38
10648,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_2,"I get it, Jamie, but in the heat of the moment, I genuinely didn't spot you. My focus was on the defender in front of me.",2024-09-03 21:39:38
10649,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_1,"It just felt like you weren't trusting me, and it was frustrating.",2024-09-03 21:48:38
10650,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_2,"I hear you. Trust me, it wasn't personal. Maybe we need to communicate better on the field.",2024-09-03 21:54:38
10651,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_1,"Yeah, maybe. We should probably work on our signals or something.",2024-09-03 21:59:38
10652,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's practice some plays so we can read each other better next time.,2024-09-03 22:01:38
10653,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_1,"Good idea. And I'll try to be more vocal too, so I'm not just expecting you to see me.",2024-09-03 22:11:38
10654,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_2,Perfect. Let's make sure this doesn't happen again. We both want the team to win.,2024-09-03 22:21:38
10655,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_1,"Yeah, definitely. Thanks for talking this through, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:24:38
10656,deescalatory_conversation_145,speaker_2,"Anytime, Jamie. We're in this together.",2024-09-03 22:26:38
10657,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted our project without even consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:23:41
10658,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,"I had to, the deadline was looming and you weren’t responding to my messages.",2024-09-03 21:28:41
10659,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,That’s because I was busy working on my part of it. You should have waited or called me.,2024-09-03 21:33:41
10660,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I thought it was better to submit something than miss the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:43:41
10661,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,"Well, you could have mentioned my contributions. It looks like you did everything yourself.",2024-09-03 21:45:41
10662,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have credited your work properly. That was my mistake.",2024-09-03 21:52:41
10663,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,"Okay, but how are we going to fix this? Our grade might suffer because of this mess.",2024-09-03 21:57:41
10664,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,We could email the professor explaining the situation and make sure we properly highlight your contributions.,2024-09-03 22:02:41
10665,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Do you think she'll understand?,2024-09-03 22:08:41
10666,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,I hope so. She usually appreciates honesty and teamwork.,2024-09-03 22:10:41
10667,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,Let's draft the email together so we both agree on how to present it.,2024-09-03 22:12:41
10668,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,Good idea. Let’s meet in the library after class to work on it.,2024-09-03 22:19:41
10669,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_1,"Alright, let's make sure we communicate better from now on.",2024-09-03 22:25:41
10670,deescalatory_conversation_146,speaker_2,"Definitely. We’re a team, and we need to act like one.",2024-09-03 22:30:41
10671,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without telling us!,2024-09-03 21:25:45
10672,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,I thought we agreed I would handle the final submission.,2024-09-03 21:31:45
10673,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_3,"We agreed, but the final version still needed our review. We all could have contributed to improve it.",2024-09-03 21:36:45
10674,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,"I understand, but the deadline was approaching and I didn't want us to miss it.",2024-09-03 21:41:45
10675,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,"Yes, but rushing it like that means we potentially turned in a subpar project.",2024-09-03 21:44:45
10676,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,I see your point. I should've communicated better and asked for any last inputs.,2024-09-03 21:48:45
10677,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_3,"Exactly, just a quick message would have been enough.",2024-09-03 21:53:45
10678,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,Next time I'll make sure to involve everyone right up to the final step.,2024-09-03 22:02:45
10679,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,That sounds good. Can we look at it now and see if there are any last-minute fixes we can still make?,2024-09-03 22:03:45
10680,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_3,"Yeah, maybe the professor’s deadline isn't as strict as the submission platform's.",2024-09-03 22:13:45
10681,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,I already emailed the professor asking if we can make minor edits. Waiting for a reply.,2024-09-03 22:20:45
10682,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,"That's a good move. Hopefully, we get a green light. Let's prepare anyway.",2024-09-03 22:27:45
10683,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's work together on it and make sure everyone gets their input in.,2024-09-03 22:30:45
10684,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_2,I'll forward you both the latest version. Let's review it right away.,2024-09-03 22:39:45
10685,deescalatory_conversation_147,speaker_1,"Thanks, let's wrap this up as a strong",2024-09-03 22:46:45
10686,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,"You missed practice again, Ryan.",2024-09-03 21:22:48
10687,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,"I know, Coach, but I had a lot of homework.",2024-09-03 21:27:48
10688,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,"We've all got responsibilities, but the team needs you.",2024-09-03 21:35:48
10689,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,"I get that, Coach. I'm just struggling to balance everything.",2024-09-03 21:44:48
10690,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,Have you thought about creating a schedule? It might help manage your time better.,2024-09-03 21:48:48
10691,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,"I tried that, but it doesn't seem to work.",2024-09-03 21:52:48
10692,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,Maybe I can help. Do you have a specific problem with the schedule?,2024-09-03 21:55:48
10693,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,I always end up spending more time on one subject and then I fall behind on others.,2024-09-03 21:58:48
10694,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,Let's look at your schedule together after practice. We can figure something out.,2024-09-03 22:00:48
10695,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,"Thanks, Coach. That would be really helpful.",2024-09-03 22:03:48
10696,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,"No problem, Ryan. Just remember, we're a team, both on and off the field.",2024-09-03 22:07:48
10697,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_2,"I'll do better, Coach. I promise.",2024-09-03 22:12:48
10698,deescalatory_conversation_148,speaker_1,"That's all I ask, Ryan. We believe in you.",2024-09-03 22:19:48
10699,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_1,Why did you change the project design without telling me first?,2024-09-03 21:24:52
10700,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_2,"I thought it would be better this way, and we were running out of time to meet the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:25:52
10701,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_1,But we agreed we would discuss all major changes together. It makes it hard for me to trust your decisions when you don’t consult with me.,2024-09-03 21:29:52
10702,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I also felt pressured to make a quick decision. I didn’t want us to miss the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:33:52
10703,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_1,"Missing the deadline worries me too, but collaboration is more important. It feels like you’re not valuing my input.",2024-09-03 21:43:52
10704,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_2,I do value your input. Perhaps next time I can check in with you quickly even if we’re short on time?,2024-09-03 21:51:52
10705,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_1,"That would help. Let’s also agree to set short, frequent check-ins when the deadline is close, so we stay on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:54:52
10706,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. I didn’t mean to exclude you. Let’s try to work through this design together now.,2024-09-03 21:58:52
10707,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_1,I appreciate that. Let’s start with the changes you made and see how we can both improve on them.,2024-09-03 22:04:52
10708,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_2,Sure thing. Here’s what I was thinking for the new layout. What do you think?,2024-09-03 22:10:52
10709,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_1,It’s a good start. Maybe we can adjust this part to better align with our initial concept?,2024-09-03 22:15:52
10710,deescalatory_conversation_149,speaker_2,I,2024-09-03 22:24:52
10711,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_1,"Hey, I noticed the project presentation slides are different from what we agreed on. Did you change them without discussing with us?",2024-09-03 21:24:56
10712,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_2,"Yeah, I made some changes last night. I thought the new design looked more professional.",2024-09-03 21:25:56
10713,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_1,"I understand wanting to improve the design, but it would have been better to discuss it with the team first. We were feeling ready to present as it was.",2024-09-03 21:29:56
10714,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have discussed it with you guys. I just got carried away and didn't think it through.",2024-09-03 21:38:56
10715,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_3,I agree with speaker_1. We should value each other's input. But let's look at the new design and see if we can incorporate everyone's ideas.,2024-09-03 21:40:56
10716,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_1,"That sounds good. Speaker_2, can you explain the changes you made and why you think they're better?",2024-09-03 21:47:56
10717,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_2,Sure. I added more visuals and cut down on the text to make it more engaging. I thought it could help keep the audience's attention.,2024-09-03 21:50:56
10718,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_3,I like the idea of more visuals. Maybe we can blend both versions and find a balance that satisfies everyone.,2024-09-03 21:58:56
10719,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_1,That makes sense. I'm willing to compromise if we can agree on a final version together. Let's review both and decide what works best.,2024-09-03 22:02:56
10720,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_2,Thanks for being understanding. Let's get together and finalize this so we can all feel confident about the presentation.,2024-09-03 22:05:56
10721,deescalatory_conversation_150,speaker_3,Great. How about we meet in,2024-09-03 22:10:56
10722,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_1,"Alex, why do you always leave the dishes undone? It's your turn this week!",2024-09-03 21:23:00
10723,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_2,"Emma, I know, but I had a massive project due today. I just didn't have the time.",2024-09-03 21:32:00
10724,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_1,"We're all busy, Alex. I had my own work and still managed to do my share. It’s about responsibility.",2024-09-03 21:34:00
10725,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_2,"I get it, but just cut me some slack this once? I'll make it up tomorrow.",2024-09-03 21:39:00
10726,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_1,"It’s not just about today, Alex. This has happened multiple times. It feels like you don't respect the shared responsibilities.",2024-09-03 21:48:00
10727,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_2,I didn’t realize it was bothering you this much. I genuinely thought I could make up for it later.,2024-09-03 21:56:00
10728,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_1,"Well, it does bother me. Maybe we need to sit down and redistribute the chores if you're too busy.",2024-09-03 22:00:00
10729,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_2,"That's a good idea. Maybe if we adjust the schedule, it'll be better for both of us.",2024-09-03 22:01:00
10730,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_1,Let's do that then. How about we discuss a new plan after dinner?,2024-09-03 22:06:00
10731,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll even do the dishes tonight to show I’m committed to fixing this.,2024-09-03 22:15:00
10732,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it. Let's try to communicate better in the future.",2024-09-03 22:24:00
10733,deescalatory_conversation_151,speaker_2,Definitely. Better communication can help us avoid these conflicts.,2024-09-03 22:33:00
10734,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_1,Why didn’t you pass the ball to me? I was wide open!,2024-09-03 21:19:04
10735,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_2,"I didn't see you, okay? I was trying to avoid the defender.",2024-09-03 21:28:04
10736,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_1,"Every time, Alex. You always have an excuse.",2024-09-03 21:38:04
10737,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_2,"Look, I’m doing my best out there. Can we just focus on the game plan?",2024-09-03 21:47:04
10738,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_1,"The game plan involves teamwork, and right now we're not playing like a team.",2024-09-03 21:53:04
10739,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_3,"Guys, can we chill for a second? Arguing isn’t helping us win.",2024-09-03 22:01:04
10740,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_1,It’s just frustrating. I feel like my efforts are being ignored.,2024-09-03 22:02:04
10741,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_2,I get that. I didn’t mean to ignore you. Maybe we need to communicate better on the field.,2024-09-03 22:04:04
10742,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_1,"Yeah, maybe we do. Can we try calling out to each other more?",2024-09-03 22:08:04
10743,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_2,"Absolutely. If you call out, I’ll make an extra effort to look for you.",2024-09-03 22:09:04
10744,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_3,That sounds better. Let's just focus on improving our communication and we'll do better.,2024-09-03 22:15:04
10745,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_1,Alright. Let’s get back out there and work as a team.,2024-09-03 22:22:04
10746,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s make this next play count.,2024-09-03 22:28:04
10747,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_3,"Okay, team on three: One, two, three, team!",2024-09-03 22:31:04
10748,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_1,Team!,2024-09-03 22:36:04
10749,deescalatory_conversation_152,speaker_2,Team!,2024-09-03 22:37:04
10750,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_1,"Sarah, why didn't you tell us that you were changing the meeting time?",2024-09-03 21:20:07
10751,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_2,"John, I did send a message in the group chat. Didn't you see it?",2024-09-03 21:25:07
10752,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_1,I checked it this morning and there was nothing there. Can you show me?,2024-09-03 21:33:07
10753,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_2,"Sure, let me pull it up on my phone. Here, see? I posted it yesterday afternoon.",2024-09-03 21:41:07
10754,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_3,"Hey guys, I think the main issue is that not everyone checks the group chat regularly. Maybe we need a better way to communicate these changes.",2024-09-03 21:51:07
10755,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_1,"You're right, Sarah. Sorry, I didn't see the message. Maybe we need to use email as well, just to be sure?",2024-09-03 21:57:07
10756,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_2,"I understand, John. I can start sending emails too. Does that work for everyone?",2024-09-03 22:07:07
10757,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_3,That sounds like a good idea. It’ll help prevent any mix-ups in the future.,2024-09-03 22:11:07
10758,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks for understanding, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:19:07
10759,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_2,"No problem. Thanks, John, for being open to fixing this. Let’s move forward with the new plan then.",2024-09-03 22:22:07
10760,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_3,"Great. So, for future meetings, group chat and email updates. Got it.",2024-09-03 22:23:07
10761,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_1,Perfect. Let’s make sure this doesn’t disrupt our project again.,2024-09-03 22:26:07
10762,deescalatory_conversation_153,speaker_2,"Definitely. We’re all on the same page now. Thanks, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:36:07
10763,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,"Sarah, why did you take my laptop without asking? I was using it for my project.",2024-09-03 21:19:11
10764,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,"I needed it for my assignment, Jake. My laptop broke down, and I thought you'd be okay with it.",2024-09-03 21:24:11
10765,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,You could have at least asked. Now all my work is mixed up with yours.,2024-09-03 21:28:11
10766,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,"Okay, I'm sorry. I should have asked. How can we sort this out now?",2024-09-03 21:36:11
10767,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,I guess we could try to separate our files and make sure nothing got deleted.,2024-09-03 21:44:11
10768,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,"Alright, let me help you with that. Can you show me which files you need?",2024-09-03 21:47:11
10769,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,"Sure, I have them all in this folder. Let's go through them together.",2024-09-03 21:57:11
10770,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,"Okay, I see. Here are some of my files that got mixed in. I'll move them out.",2024-09-03 22:03:11
10771,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,"Thanks. I appreciate it. Next time, just give me a heads-up, alright?",2024-09-03 22:12:11
10772,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I'll make sure to ask first. Sorry for the trouble, Jake.",2024-09-03 22:14:11
10773,deescalatory_conversation_154,speaker_1,It's okay. Just glad we could sort it out calmly. Let's finish our work.,2024-09-03 22:15:11
10774,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball in the final minutes of the game!,2024-09-03 21:25:14
10775,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,"You were double-teamed, I had a clearer shot.",2024-09-03 21:28:14
10776,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,But I was our top scorer tonight!,2024-09-03 21:33:14
10777,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,It's not always about scoring; it's about making the smart play.,2024-09-03 21:35:14
10778,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,"We lost the game because of your ""smart play.""",2024-09-03 21:45:14
10779,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_3,"Hey, let's cool down. We all want to win, and pointing fingers won't help.",2024-09-03 21:47:14
10780,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,"Yeah, well, it's frustrating to feel ignored out there.",2024-09-03 21:55:14
10781,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,"I get that, but we're a team. Everyone's decisions impact the game.",2024-09-03 21:59:14
10782,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_3,Maybe we should review the game footage together and see what we can improve as a team.,2024-09-03 22:09:14
10783,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,"Alright, that's fair. I just want to make sure my effort is recognized.",2024-09-03 22:13:14
10784,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,And I want us to trust each other more.,2024-09-03 22:20:14
10785,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_3,Agreed. Trust and communication are key. Can we all work on this together?,2024-09-03 22:23:14
10786,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_1,"Yeah, I'm in. Let's figure this out for next time.",2024-09-03 22:28:14
10787,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_2,Me too. We're stronger as a team.,2024-09-03 22:37:14
10788,deescalatory_conversation_155,speaker_3,"Great, let's channel this energy into our next practice and get better together.",2024-09-03 22:47:14
10789,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,"Jake, you missed the project deadline again. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:25:17
10790,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,"Sarah, I know, but I had so many other things going on. It's not easy keeping up with everything.",2024-09-03 21:26:17
10791,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,"I get that you're busy, but this project is a team effort. We all rely on each other's contributions.",2024-09-03 21:31:17
10792,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,I understand. Maybe we can find a way to manage the workload better?,2024-09-03 21:38:17
10793,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,That's a good start. How about we set up some check-in points to make sure everyone is on track?,2024-09-03 21:45:17
10794,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,That could work. Maybe a mid-week update would help us stay aligned.,2024-09-03 21:53:17
10795,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,"Exactly. And if anyone is falling behind, we can figure out how to support them sooner rather than later.",2024-09-03 21:59:17
10796,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,"Agreed. Also, if I'm struggling with something, I'll ask for help instead of letting it slide.",2024-09-03 22:05:17
10797,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,Perfect. We're all here to help each other. Let's make sure we keep the communication open.,2024-09-03 22:13:17
10798,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_2,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate your understanding. I'll make sure to improve on this.",2024-09-03 22:23:17
10799,deescalatory_conversation_156,speaker_1,"No problem, Jake. We're a team, and we all want to succeed together.",2024-09-03 22:25:17
10800,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and talked to the manager about the project without me.,2024-09-03 21:21:21
10801,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to exclude you. I thought you were too busy, and we needed an update urgently.",2024-09-03 21:22:21
10802,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,"But you know how important this project is to me. We should be working as a team, not making solo decisions.",2024-09-03 21:24:21
10803,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. Can we discuss how to handle this together next time?,2024-09-03 21:27:21
10804,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,I appreciate that. Let's set a rule that no major decisions are made without both of us being involved.,2024-09-03 21:32:21
10805,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,"Agreed. We’re stronger as a team, and I don’t want to jeopardize that.",2024-09-03 21:33:21
10806,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,"Okay, let's move forward. What updates did you give to the manager?",2024-09-03 21:39:21
10807,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,I shared the latest figures and our projected timeline. They seemed satisfied but had some questions about our milestones.,2024-09-03 21:45:21
10808,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,Alright. Let’s review those questions and make sure everything is aligned before the next meeting.,2024-09-03 21:53:21
10809,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,"Sounds good. I’ll make notes, and we can go through them together tomorrow.",2024-09-03 22:03:21
10810,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I’m glad we’re on the same page now.,2024-09-03 22:08:21
10811,deescalatory_conversation_157,speaker_2,Me too. Let's knock this out of the park as a united front.,2024-09-03 22:11:21
10812,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_1,I don't understand why you didn't pass the ball when I was wide open.,2024-09-03 21:20:24
10813,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"Because you missed three shots in a row before that, I thought it was better to take the chance myself.",2024-09-03 21:26:24
10814,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_1,"But I'm on the team to help, not to be ignored. We can't win if we don't trust each other.",2024-09-03 21:29:24
10815,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,You're right. Maybe I should've trusted you more in that moment.,2024-09-03 21:31:24
10816,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_3,"Guys, we all want the same thing: to win. Let's figure out how to improve our plays next time.",2024-09-03 21:34:24
10817,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_1,Maybe we can work on some passing drills to build that trust.,2024-09-03 21:38:24
10818,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,"Yeah, I'd be up for that. Also, let's set up some practice plays to improve our coordination.",2024-09-03 21:48:24
10819,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_3,Sounds like a plan. We need to remember we're a team. We rise and fall together.,2024-09-03 21:53:24
10820,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_1,"Agreed. I'll make sure to be more consistent with my shots, too.",2024-09-03 22:03:24
10821,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_2,And I'll work on distributing the ball better. Let's get back on track together.,2024-09-03 22:08:24
10822,deescalatory_conversation_158,speaker_3,Awesome. Let's shake on it and move forward stronger as a team.,2024-09-03 22:17:24
10823,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,"Why did you take the last granola bar without asking, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:27:28
10824,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, Sam. There's plenty of other snacks.",2024-09-03 21:37:28
10825,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,It's not about the snacks; it's about courtesy. We share this place and should respect each other's things.,2024-09-03 21:38:28
10826,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"I get that, but you never mentioned it was a problem before. I just assumed it was fine.",2024-09-03 21:41:28
10827,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,"Maybe I should have said something earlier, but it's common sense to check with someone before taking their stuff.",2024-09-03 21:51:28
10828,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have asked. I didn't mean to upset you. Can we agree on some house rules for the future?",2024-09-03 21:56:28
10829,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,That would be a good idea. Clear communication can avoid misunderstandings like this.,2024-09-03 22:01:28
10830,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"Let's write down some guidelines and stick them on the fridge. That way, we're both aware of what's okay and what's not.",2024-09-03 22:06:28
10831,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,"Sounds fair. And next time, if you're not sure, just ask me first.",2024-09-03 22:11:28
10832,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for being understanding, Sam. Let's make this work better for both of us.",2024-09-03 22:17:28
10833,deescalatory_conversation_159,speaker_1,"Agreed, Alex. This conversation itself makes a big difference. Let's start fresh.",2024-09-03 22:24:28
10834,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted that design without consulting me!,2024-09-03 21:20:32
10835,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,"I thought it was urgent, and we didn't have time to wait for more feedback.",2024-09-03 21:30:32
10836,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,"So, you decided to just ignore my input entirely?",2024-09-03 21:35:32
10837,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,I didn't mean to ignore you. I just wanted to make sure we met the deadline.,2024-09-03 21:39:32
10838,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,"But wouldn't it have been better to present a united front, even if it meant pushing the deadline a bit?",2024-09-03 21:45:32
10839,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,"I understand your point, but I was also worried about what the client would think if we delayed.",2024-09-03 21:47:32
10840,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,We could have explained the situation to the client. They might have appreciated our thoroughness.,2024-09-03 21:49:32
10841,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,You’re right. I should have communicated my concerns to you and included you in the decision-making process.,2024-09-03 21:51:32
10842,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,And I should have been more proactive in checking in instead of assuming everything was on track.,2024-09-03 21:55:32
10843,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,How about we set up a stricter check-in schedule to avoid this kind of situation in the future?,2024-09-03 22:03:32
10844,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,That sounds like a good plan. Communication is definitely key here.,2024-09-03 22:08:32
10845,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's ensure we're both looped in for any major decisions moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:13:32
10846,deescalatory_conversation_160,speaker_1,Deal. Let's focus on moving past this and delivering the best work we can.,2024-09-03 22:15:32
10847,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,"Why didn't you finish the report, Steve? We agreed everyone would have their parts done by today.",2024-09-03 21:25:35
10848,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"I know, Lisa, but I had a family emergency. I couldn't get it done on time.",2024-09-03 21:28:35
10849,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,You should have at least told us. We could have figured something out.,2024-09-03 21:35:35
10850,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_3,"Yeah, we were all counting on you, Steve. We had a client meeting today!",2024-09-03 21:42:35
10851,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,I'm really sorry. I should've communicated better. Is there anything we can do to fix this now?,2024-09-03 21:51:35
10852,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,"The client wasn't happy, but maybe we can get an extension if we send a partial draft.",2024-09-03 21:57:35
10853,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_3,"Steve, can you finish your part by tomorrow? We might still pull this off.",2024-09-03 22:04:35
10854,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"Yes, I can work on it tonight and have it done by morning.",2024-09-03 22:06:35
10855,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_1,"Alright, let's focus on getting this done. We'll handle the client communication and set up another meeting.",2024-09-03 22:10:35
10856,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_3,"Just keep us updated this time, okay? We're a team and we need to stick together.",2024-09-03 22:19:35
10857,deescalatory_conversation_161,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I won't let this happen again. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:20:35
10858,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,Why didn’t you pass me the ball during the last quarter?,2024-09-03 21:24:39
10859,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,"I thought I had a clear shot, okay?",2024-09-03 21:30:39
10860,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"But you missed it, and we lost the game because of that!",2024-09-03 21:34:39
10861,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,It’s not fair to put all the blame on me. Everyone had their share of mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:43:39
10862,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,"Guys, let’s calm down. Blaming each other isn’t helping us improve.",2024-09-03 21:44:39
10863,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"I’m not blaming, I’m just frustrated. We worked so hard, and it felt like we weren't on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:54:39
10864,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,I get it; I messed up during that shot. But we need to focus on fixing our coordination.,2024-09-03 21:56:39
10865,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,Agreed. How about we watch the game footage together and see where we all can improve?,2024-09-03 22:00:39
10866,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,"That sounds good. I didn’t mean to single you out, it’s just frustrating to lose like that.",2024-09-03 22:06:39
10867,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,I understand. We need to communicate better on the court.,2024-09-03 22:07:39
10868,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,"Right, next practice we should work on plays where we involve everyone and improve our teamwork.",2024-09-03 22:13:39
10869,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_1,Teamwork is definitely key. Let’s make sure we talk more during the game about who’s in the best position.,2024-09-03 22:21:39
10870,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_2,"Yeah, we should practice more situational plays.",2024-09-03 22:24:39
10871,deescalatory_conversation_162,speaker_3,"Exactly, and let’s remember, we’re a team and we win or lose together.",2024-09-03 22:34:39
10872,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,We really need to talk about what happened during the presentation today.,2024-09-03 21:26:43
10873,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"Yeah, we do. I can't believe you just went off-script like that.",2024-09-03 21:36:43
10874,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,I went off-script because the slides weren't loading properly! I had to improvise.,2024-09-03 21:43:43
10875,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,But you didn't stick to our agreed points. It made me look like I wasn't prepared.,2024-09-03 21:51:43
10876,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,"I understand that it was frustrating. However, I didn't see another option at the moment.",2024-09-03 21:55:43
10877,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"You could have at least given me some sort of signal, so I wasn't caught off guard.",2024-09-03 22:04:43
10878,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,You're right. I should have found a way to communicate with you. I apologize.,2024-09-03 22:05:43
10879,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,I just felt like you undermined our teamwork. We both put so much effort into this.,2024-09-03 22:10:43
10880,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,I get that. It wasn’t my intention to undermine our partnership. What do you think we should do differently next time?,2024-09-03 22:13:43
10881,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,"Maybe we can create a backup plan for technical issues. That way, we're both on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:14:43
10882,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,"That sounds like a great idea. Also, let’s work on some non-verbal cues to use if things go wrong.",2024-09-03 22:17:43
10883,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_2,Agreed. I think that will help a lot. Can we also split responsibilities more clearly for next time?,2024-09-03 22:23:43
10884,deescalatory_conversation_163,speaker_1,For sure. Let's list out our tasks clearly so we both know who’s handling what.,2024-09-03 22:31:43
10885,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you dropped the class?,2024-09-03 21:26:45
10886,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal. It's just one class.,2024-09-03 21:29:45
10887,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,But we planned our schedules together! Now I'm stuck with that professor alone.,2024-09-03 21:33:45
10888,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,"Sorry, I figured you could handle it. You've always been better at calculus anyway.",2024-09-03 21:34:45
10889,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,"Still, a heads-up would have been nice. Now I'm behind on our joint project.",2024-09-03 21:40:45
10890,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,"I get it, my bad. Is there a way I can help catch us up?",2024-09-03 21:49:45
10891,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,Maybe. Could you help me with the research part tonight?,2024-09-03 21:59:45
10892,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,"Sure, I can do that. Let's meet at the library around 7?",2024-09-03 22:05:45
10893,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,That works for me. Thanks for stepping up.,2024-09-03 22:14:45
10894,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,"No problem. I should've told you earlier. Teamwork, right?",2024-09-03 22:18:45
10895,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_1,"Yeah, teamwork. Let's get this project back on track.",2024-09-03 22:24:45
10896,deescalatory_conversation_164,speaker_2,Agreed. We'll finish it stronger together.,2024-09-03 22:30:45
10897,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,"You didn't clean the dishes like you promised, Lisa. Now we're late for the party.",2024-09-03 21:27:48
10898,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,"I know, Jake, but I had so much homework. Couldn't you have done them instead?",2024-09-03 21:29:48
10899,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,We agreed you'd handle the dishes while I did the laundry. It's about keeping our commitments.,2024-09-03 21:38:48
10900,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,"You're right, Jake. I should've managed my time better. Can we work together to clean up quickly now?",2024-09-03 21:44:48
10901,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Let's split the remaining chores so we can still make it to the party.,2024-09-03 21:45:48
10902,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,"Perfect. I'll tackle the dishes right away, and maybe you can help me with the trash?",2024-09-03 21:51:48
10903,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_1,Deal. I'll take out the trash now. We can talk about rearranging our chores later to avoid this in the future.,2024-09-03 21:53:48
10904,deescalatory_conversation_165,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's finish up so we can enjoy the party together.,2024-09-03 21:56:48
10905,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,"Why did you change the project design without telling anyone, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:28:52
10906,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, James. The old design had flaws, and I just wanted to make it better.",2024-09-03 21:30:52
10907,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,But we had agreed on that design. Now it feels like you're not valuing our input.,2024-09-03 21:38:52
10908,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_3,I have to agree with James. We were all involved in creating the original design.,2024-09-03 21:43:52
10909,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"I understand where you're coming from, but I did it for the benefit of the project. I thought we wanted the best outcome.",2024-09-03 21:44:52
10910,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,"Improving the design is great, Sarah, but we need to communicate these changes. We’re a team.",2024-09-03 21:53:52
10911,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,You're right. I should have discussed it with you both before making changes. Can we look at the new design together and see if we all agree?,2024-09-03 21:59:52
10912,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_3,That sounds fair. Let's review it and see if there are elements we all can agree on.,2024-09-03 22:05:52
10913,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_1,"Okay, I’m willing to give it a chance. Let's go through the new design and make decisions as a team from now on.",2024-09-03 22:07:52
10914,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_2,"Thanks, James. I promise to keep everyone in the loop moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:16:52
10915,deescalatory_conversation_166,speaker_3,Great. Let's make sure we all feel heard and respected during this process.,2024-09-03 22:18:52
10916,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,Why did you tell everyone that I was the one who messed up the project?,2024-09-03 21:25:54
10917,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,I didn't say just you; I mentioned that we all made mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:29:54
10918,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,But you specifically pointed out my part in front of the whole team.,2024-09-03 21:31:54
10919,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,I was just trying to be honest about what went wrong so we could fix it together.,2024-09-03 21:36:54
10920,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,It felt like you were blaming me. Everyone looked at me like it was all my fault.,2024-09-03 21:40:54
10921,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,I can see how it came across that way. That wasn't my intention at all. I should have phrased it better.,2024-09-03 21:44:54
10922,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,Can we agree to handle it differently next time?,2024-09-03 21:51:54
10923,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's focus on finding solutions together instead of pointing fingers.,2024-09-03 21:54:54
10924,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Maybe next time we can address issues in a smaller group first?",2024-09-03 21:55:54
10925,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. Let's make sure we communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:02:54
10926,deescalatory_conversation_167,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's get back to fixing the project then.,2024-09-03 22:07:54
10927,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and took the lead on the project without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:20:58
10928,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,I didn't mean to go behind your back. I thought you were okay with me taking the reins since you seemed so busy.,2024-09-03 21:26:58
10929,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,But you didn't check with me. We should have talked about it first.,2024-09-03 21:29:58
10930,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated my intentions better. Why don't we discuss how we can move forward together?,2024-09-03 21:35:58
10931,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,That would be a good start. I just felt sidelined and disrespected.,2024-09-03 21:38:58
10932,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,I understand. Let's make sure we consider each other's schedules and input before making decisions next time.,2024-09-03 21:48:58
10933,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,"Agreed. I think we both want the project to succeed, so better communication is key.",2024-09-03 21:54:58
10934,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,Definitely. Do you have any suggestions on how we can divide the tasks more effectively?,2024-09-03 22:03:58
10935,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,How about we create a shared task list and assign roles based on our strengths?,2024-09-03 22:13:58
10936,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,That sounds like a great idea. I'll set up a meeting to go over the details.,2024-09-03 22:21:58
10937,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_1,Perfect. Thank you for understanding where I was coming from.,2024-09-03 22:31:58
10938,deescalatory_conversation_168,speaker_2,Thank you for bringing it up. I'm glad we could resolve this together.,2024-09-03 22:40:58
10939,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,"Jenna, I don't understand why you didn't invite me to your birthday party.",2024-09-03 21:26:01
10940,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"Sam, it's not that I didn't want to; it was just a small gathering, and I thought it wouldn't be your scene.",2024-09-03 21:34:01
10941,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,But we've been friends for years. It feels like you're excluding me.,2024-09-03 21:39:01
10942,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,I can see why you'd feel that way. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just didn't think you'd enjoy it.,2024-09-03 21:47:01
10943,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,Maybe you could have let me decide that for myself.,2024-09-03 21:57:01
10944,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have asked you. How can I make it up to you?",2024-09-03 21:58:01
10945,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,I guess just being honest with me would help. Were there other reasons you didn't invite me?,2024-09-03 22:04:01
10946,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"Honestly, I was a bit worried about mixing different groups of friends. I wasn't sure how it would go.",2024-09-03 22:07:01
10947,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,"That makes sense. Still, I wish you'd talked to me about it.",2024-09-03 22:16:01
10948,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"I understand. Next time, I'll make sure to communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:20:01
10949,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jenna. I appreciate that.",2024-09-03 22:28:01
10950,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,"No problem, Sam. Can we move forward from this?",2024-09-03 22:31:01
10951,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_1,"Yes, we can. Let's hang out soon and catch up properly.",2024-09-03 22:34:01
10952,deescalatory_conversation_169,speaker_2,That sounds great. Looking forward to it.,2024-09-03 22:38:01
10953,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,"Alex, why did you submit your part of the group project so late?",2024-09-03 21:21:04
10954,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,"Look, Max, I had a lot on my plate. I'm sorry it was late, but what's done is done.",2024-09-03 21:27:04
10955,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,But your delay almost caused us to miss the deadline. Do you understand how that put everyone in a tough spot?,2024-09-03 21:28:04
10956,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,I get it. I'm not saying it was right. Can we figure out a way to make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 21:34:04
10957,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_3,Maybe we should all set earlier internal deadlines to check each other's progress next time.,2024-09-03 21:39:04
10958,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,That's a good idea. We should have more checkpoints so we're not solely relying on last-minute submissions.,2024-09-03 21:42:04
10959,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to update you guys more frequently. Communication is key.,2024-09-03 21:45:04
10960,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_3,"Awesome. So, how do we move forward with this project now? Any revisions needed?",2024-09-03 21:50:04
10961,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,"Yes, we need to refine the summary and add more sources to the research section. Can we divide these tasks fairly?",2024-09-03 21:58:04
10962,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,I can handle adding the sources. I have access to the library database.,2024-09-03 22:01:04
10963,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_3,"Great, I'll work on the summary. Let's aim to have everything updated by tomorrow evening.",2024-09-03 22:09:04
10964,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_1,Thank you both. This is much better. Let’s keep each other in the loop from now on.,2024-09-03 22:16:04
10965,deescalatory_conversation_170,speaker_2,"Definitely. Thanks for understanding, and sorry again for the delay",2024-09-03 22:17:04
10966,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,Why did you submit the group report without checking with us first?,2024-09-03 21:22:07
10967,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,I thought you guys were okay with everything; we reviewed it yesterday.,2024-09-03 21:28:07
10968,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_3,But we found a few errors this morning! We didn't get a chance to fix them.,2024-09-03 21:34:07
10969,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,"Exactly, now our grade might be affected.",2024-09-03 21:36:07
10970,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,"I get it, but the deadline was tight. I didn't want us to miss it.",2024-09-03 21:45:07
10971,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_3,"Still, a quick message wouldn’t have hurt. We could have helped you.",2024-09-03 21:49:07
10972,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better.,2024-09-03 21:54:07
10973,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,"Maybe next time, we should set a final review session before submitting anything.",2024-09-03 22:03:07
10974,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_3,That sounds good. We all want the best grade possible.,2024-09-03 22:09:07
10975,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,"Agreed. Let's make sure we all look over the final drafts next time, together.",2024-09-03 22:14:07
10976,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let’s turn this into a learning experience.,2024-09-03 22:16:07
10977,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_3,"Yeah, we can still make this work positively.",2024-09-03 22:23:07
10978,deescalatory_conversation_171,speaker_2,For sure. We learned something valuable for future projects.,2024-09-03 22:27:07
10979,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,Why did you use my part of the presentation without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:25:09
10980,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,"I thought it would fit well with the rest of the slides, and we were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:27:09
10981,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,"But I worked really hard on that section, and now it's not going to be presented the way I planned.",2024-09-03 21:30:09
10982,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I should have consulted you. Can we find a way to integrate your ideas back in?",2024-09-03 21:32:09
10983,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,That would definitely help. I just felt a bit sidelined.,2024-09-03 21:37:09
10984,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,I understand. How about we review the slides now and see where your part can fit in better?,2024-09-03 21:41:09
10985,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,"Good idea. And next time, let's make sure we discuss any changes before making them.",2024-09-03 21:48:09
10986,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I agree. Collaborating better will help us avoid this in the future.",2024-09-03 21:52:09
10987,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's get to work on these slides now.,2024-09-03 22:01:09
10988,deescalatory_conversation_172,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan.,2024-09-03 22:02:09
10989,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just took my design and presented it as your own, Jim.",2024-09-03 21:22:13
10990,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"I didn’t mean to take credit, Sarah. I just thought we were teaming up on the project.",2024-09-03 21:27:13
10991,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,Teaming up? You didn’t mention my contributions at all during the presentation!,2024-09-03 21:31:13
10992,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,I’m really sorry. I got carried away trying to impress the client. I should have acknowledged your work.,2024-09-03 21:37:13
10993,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"It's not just about acknowledgment, Jim. This happens all the time. I feel like you don't respect my effort.",2024-09-03 21:38:13
10994,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"I do respect your effort, Sarah. I guess I need to be more mindful about expressing that. How can I make it right?",2024-09-03 21:44:13
10995,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"For starters, you could send a follow-up email to the client giving credit where it's due.",2024-09-03 21:53:13
10996,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,That’s a good idea. I'll do that right away. What else?,2024-09-03 22:00:13
10997,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,We should set clear boundaries and responsibilities for our parts in future projects.,2024-09-03 22:07:13
10998,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s also make a habit of checking in with each other before any meetings or presentations.,2024-09-03 22:11:13
10999,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I just want to make sure our work reflects both of our contributions equally.,2024-09-03 22:15:13
11000,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I value our partnership, Sarah. Let's work on better communication moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:23:13
11001,deescalatory_conversation_173,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jim. I appreciate your willingness to fix this. Let’s move past it",2024-09-03 22:31:13
11002,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,Why did you change the project schedule without informing us?,2024-09-03 21:27:17
11003,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,"I had to adjust it because we were falling behind, and I thought it was the best way to catch up.",2024-09-03 21:31:17
11004,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,But we had plans based on the original schedule. Now everything is messed up.,2024-09-03 21:35:17
11005,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_3,"We understand it’s frustrating, but let’s try to figure out how we can move forward from here.",2024-09-03 21:38:17
11006,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I just didn't want us to miss the deadline.,2024-09-03 21:43:17
11007,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_4,Couldn't we have had a meeting to discuss the changes before they were made?,2024-09-03 21:53:17
11008,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,"Yes, you’re right. I should have communicated it better. I apologize for that.",2024-09-03 21:56:17
11009,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,"Ok, well, what's done is done. How do we make sure it doesn’t happen again?",2024-09-03 22:03:17
11010,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_3,What if we set up a weekly check-in to discuss any potential changes before they’re implemented?,2024-09-03 22:13:17
11011,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_4,That sounds reasonable. It could prevent any last-minute surprises.,2024-09-03 22:14:17
11012,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_2,I agree. I’ll make sure to bring up any modifications during those meetings.,2024-09-03 22:15:17
11013,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_1,Alright. Let's focus on getting back on track with our project now.,2024-09-03 22:19:17
11014,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_3,Absolutely. We can divide the tasks so we can catch up efficiently.,2024-09-03 22:25:17
11015,deescalatory_conversation_174,speaker_4,I’m okay with that. Let’s coordinate the new tasks right away.,2024-09-03 22:33:17
11016,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,"Jason, why didn't you tell me you were skipping practice last week?",2024-09-03 21:26:22
11017,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,"Sarah, I didn't think it was a big deal. We weren't even playing a game, just doing drills.",2024-09-03 21:28:22
11018,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,"But when you miss practice, we all suffer. Coach James was really upset.",2024-09-03 21:35:22
11019,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,I had stuff I needed to take care of. I can't always be there like you.,2024-09-03 21:44:22
11020,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,"I understand you have other responsibilities, but we need everyone to be committed to the team.",2024-09-03 21:48:22
11021,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,"I get that, but sometimes things come up last minute. What do you want me to do?",2024-09-03 21:50:22
11022,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,At least let us know ahead of time. We can plan around it if we know in advance.,2024-09-03 21:54:22
11023,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,"Okay, I can do that. I just didn't think missing one practice would cause such a problem.",2024-09-03 22:01:22
11024,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,"It's not just about one practice. It's about setting an example for everyone else. When one person skips, it affects the whole team's morale.",2024-09-03 22:03:22
11025,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,"You're right, Sarah. I'll make sure to inform you guys next time if I can't make it.",2024-09-03 22:07:22
11026,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jason. We all have to work together if we want to win the championship this year.",2024-09-03 22:11:22
11027,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll be more mindful from now on.,2024-09-03 22:14:22
11028,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_1,Great. Let's focus on moving forward and giving our best.,2024-09-03 22:16:22
11029,deescalatory_conversation_175,speaker_2,Sounds good. Let's win,2024-09-03 22:20:22
11030,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't tell me we had a project due today!,2024-09-03 21:24:25
11031,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,I thought you knew! We talked about it last week.,2024-09-03 21:33:25
11032,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,"No, you just mentioned it briefly. You didn't say it was a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:38:25
11033,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,"Okay, maybe that's true. But still, it's on the syllabus.",2024-09-03 21:41:25
11034,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,"Yeah, but I rely on you to keep track of these things.",2024-09-03 21:42:25
11035,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,I get that. I should have reminded you again. Sorry about that.,2024-09-03 21:44:25
11036,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,It's just frustrating because now I look irresponsible.,2024-09-03 21:48:25
11037,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,I understand. But we can still pull through if we work together now.,2024-09-03 21:52:25
11038,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,Do you think we have enough time to get it done properly?,2024-09-03 22:00:25
11039,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,"Yes, if we divide the work and focus. Let's split the tasks.",2024-09-03 22:01:25
11040,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,"Alright, I'll handle the research part.",2024-09-03 22:04:25
11041,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,And I'll start working on the presentation slides.,2024-09-03 22:07:25
11042,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_1,Sounds good. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:12:25
11043,deescalatory_conversation_176,speaker_2,No problem. Let's make sure to keep better track next time.,2024-09-03 22:13:25
11044,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't tell me about the deadline extension for the group project, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:28:30
11045,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Mark. I thought everyone in the group knew. I didn't realize you missed the email.",2024-09-03 21:30:30
11046,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"But still, you should've double-checked. Now I'm way behind on my part.",2024-09-03 21:34:30
11047,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"I understand, and that was my oversight. Let's figure out how we can catch you up. What part are you struggling with the most?",2024-09-03 21:37:30
11048,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,The data analysis. I haven't even started because I thought we only had two days left.,2024-09-03 21:41:30
11049,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"Got it. I can help you get started with that. I'll send you the initial data files I used, and we can go through it together.",2024-09-03 21:45:30
11050,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"Okay, that would help. But it's still going to take a lot of time. What if I don't finish in time?",2024-09-03 21:52:30
11051,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"If it looks like you won't finish, I can pitch in more time over the weekend. We can work on it as a team and make sure it gets done.",2024-09-03 21:53:30
11052,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I just don't want to be the reason our project suffers.,2024-09-03 22:01:30
11053,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,"I know, Mark. We all want to succeed. Let's communicate better moving forward so this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:09:30
11054,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_1,"Agreed. I'll make sure to check my email more often too. Thanks for the help, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:19:30
11055,deescalatory_conversation_177,speaker_2,No problem,2024-09-03 22:28:30
11056,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball during the game, Alex? We could have won!",2024-09-03 21:26:33
11057,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, Sam. The defense was all over me.",2024-09-03 21:28:33
11058,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,"Come on, I was wide open! Are you just trying to hog the spotlight?",2024-09-03 21:36:33
11059,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"No, it's not like that. I was in a tough spot and had to make a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:42:33
11060,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_3,"Guys, let's calm down and figure this out. Alex, did you really not see Sam?",2024-09-03 21:52:33
11061,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"Honestly, I didn't. I was focused on trying to get past my defender.",2024-09-03 21:53:33
11062,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,Maybe I should have called out louder. I just felt ignored out there.,2024-09-03 22:02:33
11063,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,I get that. I'll try to be more aware of my surroundings next time.,2024-09-03 22:09:33
11064,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_3,"And Sam, remember to communicate clearly. We all need to be vocal to work as a team.",2024-09-03 22:15:33
11065,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_1,"You're right. I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to question your intentions.",2024-09-03 22:17:33
11066,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_2,"It's okay, Sam. Let's just learn from this and do better next game, together.",2024-09-03 22:24:33
11067,deescalatory_conversation_178,speaker_3,"That's the spirit. We're a team, and we win or lose together.",2024-09-03 22:34:33
11068,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you delete my part of the group project?",2024-09-03 21:24:39
11069,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,"I’m sorry, I didn’t think it was relevant to our topic.",2024-09-03 21:34:39
11070,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,You didn’t even ask me! I put a lot of work into that section.,2024-09-03 21:41:39
11071,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_3,"Look, let's all calm down. Maybe there was a misunderstanding.",2024-09-03 21:51:39
11072,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,I really didn't mean to upset you. I just thought it was off-topic.,2024-09-03 21:56:39
11073,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"Okay, but we should discuss these things as a group first.",2024-09-03 22:00:39
11074,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's set a rule that any changes go through the entire group.,2024-09-03 22:03:39
11075,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I’m willing to redo the changes with everyone’s input.,2024-09-03 22:10:39
11076,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"Alright, I can live with that. Let’s try to communicate better from now on.",2024-09-03 22:14:39
11077,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_3,"Great. So, how about we review the project together and make sure we're all on the same page?",2024-09-03 22:16:39
11078,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. Let’s go over it now and make it stronger.,2024-09-03 22:25:39
11079,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_1,"Yeah, let’s do this as a team. Thanks for listening, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:30:39
11080,deescalatory_conversation_179,speaker_3,"Perfect, let's get started. Who wants to begin?",2024-09-03 22:36:39
11081,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,"I really don’t get why you decided to switch up the presentation order last minute, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:26:43
11082,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,"I thought it might make more sense to lead with the financials, Jenny. It seemed stronger.",2024-09-03 21:32:43
11083,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,But we planned it for weeks. Changing it now makes it look like we weren't prepared.,2024-09-03 21:33:43
11084,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,"I understand, but I felt like the clients would be more interested in seeing the numbers upfront.",2024-09-03 21:39:43
11085,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,"Hey, I noticed the change too. Maybe we can find a middle ground?",2024-09-03 21:43:43
11086,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,"Like what, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:50:43
11087,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,"What if we introduce the key findings first, then move quickly into the financials afterwards?",2024-09-03 21:51:43
11088,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,That could work. It highlights our main points early but still gets to the numbers soon.,2024-09-03 21:53:43
11089,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,I guess that way we wouldn't stray too far from our initial plan.,2024-09-03 21:59:43
11090,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,"Exactly. Plus, it shows we're flexible but still on top of things.",2024-09-03 22:07:43
11091,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,I’m okay with that compromise. We'll just need to adjust our slides a bit.,2024-09-03 22:14:43
11092,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,Fine. Let’s just make sure we all agree on the final order so there’s no more confusion.,2024-09-03 22:20:43
11093,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll re-send the updated agenda after we tweak the slides.,2024-09-03 22:26:43
11094,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_3,Great. Let’s wrap this up and make those changes quickly.,2024-09-03 22:35:43
11095,deescalatory_conversation_180,speaker_1,Thanks for being open to discussing this. Let's get it,2024-09-03 22:41:43
11096,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without even consulting us!,2024-09-03 21:23:48
11097,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,I had to. The deadline was looming and no one else was stepping up.,2024-09-03 21:30:48
11098,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_3,But we agreed to look over it one last time together. It feels like you didn't trust us to do our part.,2024-09-03 21:34:48
11099,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_1,Exactly! This isn't just about the deadline. It's about respecting each other's contributions.,2024-09-03 21:42:48
11100,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,"I respect your work, but I felt like we were running out of time. I didn't want us all to fail because we couldn't coordinate.",2024-09-03 21:46:48
11101,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_3,We’ve always managed to pull through before. Why didn’t you just send a message?,2024-09-03 21:51:48
11102,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,"I tried messaging, but no one responded in time. What was I supposed to do, let us fail?",2024-09-03 21:55:48
11103,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_1,"We understand the urgency, but acting solo isn't the solution. If there’s a problem, communicate it more clearly next time.",2024-09-03 22:02:48
11104,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,"I see your point. I was frustrated about the time, but I should have found a better way to alert you all.",2024-09-03 22:03:48
11105,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_3,Let's discuss how we can avoid this happening in the future. Maybe set a more concrete plan for our next project.,2024-09-03 22:05:48
11106,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_2,That's a good idea. Clearer roles and deadlines within the team could help.,2024-09-03 22:10:48
11107,deescalatory_conversation_181,speaker_1,"And more frequent check-ins, even if it's just a quick message. We need to make sure everyone's on the",2024-09-03 22:12:48
11108,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me about the changes in the project deadline, Tom?",2024-09-03 21:27:52
11109,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,"I thought I mentioned it in the last meeting, Sarah. Didn't you check your email?",2024-09-03 21:32:52
11110,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,"I did, but it wasn't in there. This is really frustrating. We're behind schedule now.",2024-09-03 21:36:52
11111,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,"I understand your frustration, but I honestly believed everyone was aware of the changes. Maybe it got lost in communication?",2024-09-03 21:39:52
11112,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,"Maybe, but now we have to figure out how to fix this. What's the revised deadline?",2024-09-03 21:40:52
11113,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,It's actually been moved up by a week. We have just five days now instead of the original ten.,2024-09-03 21:50:52
11114,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,"Five days? That's really tight. Okay, we need to reprioritize our tasks. Can we get everyone to meet and discuss a plan?",2024-09-03 21:53:52
11115,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's get everyone together and lay out what needs to be redone. We can delegate tasks more efficiently that way.,2024-09-03 22:03:52
11116,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,"I agree. Also, let's be sure to keep each other in the loop more effectively moving forward. Maybe more frequent updates?",2024-09-03 22:13:52
11117,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. How about we schedule quick daily check-ins until we meet the deadline?,2024-09-03 22:20:52
11118,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_1,Perfect. Let's set the first one for tomorrow morning. Thanks for being open to sorting this out.,2024-09-03 22:30:52
11119,deescalatory_conversation_182,speaker_2,"No problem, Sarah. We're a team, and we'll get through this together.",2024-09-03 22:31:52
11120,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_1,"Jared, why didn't you finish your part of the project? Now we're behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:21:55
11121,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_2,"I know, Lisa. I'm sorry. I had a family emergency. I didn't get a chance to inform you.",2024-09-03 21:22:55
11122,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_1,"I understand emergencies happen, but communication is key. We could've adjusted the plan.",2024-09-03 21:27:55
11123,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_2,You're right. I'll make sure to update the team in the future. Can we find a way to catch up now?,2024-09-03 21:30:55
11124,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_1,"We have a meeting tomorrow. If you can stay late today and work on it, I'll help.",2024-09-03 21:39:55
11125,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_2,"That sounds fair. I'll focus on my sections tonight, and we can review them in the morning.",2024-09-03 21:44:55
11126,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_1,Agreed. Let’s also discuss how we can improve our communication moving forward.,2024-09-03 21:47:55
11127,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_2,Definitely. Maybe we can set up a group chat for quick updates?,2024-09-03 21:52:55
11128,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_1,That could work. Let's propose it to everyone at the meeting.,2024-09-03 21:57:55
11129,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_2,"Sounds good. Thanks for understanding, Lisa. We’ll get through this.",2024-09-03 22:05:55
11130,deescalatory_conversation_183,speaker_1,"No problem, Jared. We’re a team. Let's get back on track together.",2024-09-03 22:06:55
11131,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead with the project presentation without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:24:58
11132,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but I thought we agreed on the points beforehand.",2024-09-03 21:31:58
11133,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_1,"We discussed some ideas, but refining and finalizing it alone wasn't part of the plan.",2024-09-03 21:35:58
11134,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_2,"You're right. I should have waited, but we were running out of time. I felt a decision needed to be made.",2024-09-03 21:42:58
11135,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_1,But we could have at least had a quick call. I was available.,2024-09-03 21:52:58
11136,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_2,I didn't think about that. Sorry for not considering your input. What can we do now to fix it?,2024-09-03 21:53:58
11137,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_1,Let's review what you've done so far and see if there's anything we need to adjust together.,2024-09-03 21:56:58
11138,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_2,"Alright, I'll pull up the slides and we can go through each point.",2024-09-03 22:01:58
11139,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_1,"Sounds good. And next time, let's promise to communicate no matter how rushed things get.",2024-09-03 22:11:58
11140,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_2,Agreed. Communication is key. Thanks for being willing to work through this.,2024-09-03 22:12:58
11141,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_1,I just want the best for our project. Let's make it the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:18:58
11142,deescalatory_conversation_184,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's do it.,2024-09-03 22:28:58
11143,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted the group project without showing it to me first, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:22:02
11144,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, Jamie, but I just wanted to meet the deadline. We were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:24:02
11145,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_1,"That's not an excuse, Alex. We agreed to review everything together before submitting. Now, if there's a mistake, it'll be on us both, and I didn't even get a chance to check it.",2024-09-03 21:25:02
11146,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_2,"You're right, Jamie. I should have involved you in the final review. How about we go through it together now and see if there's anything we need to fix or clarify with the professor?",2024-09-03 21:34:02
11147,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_1,That sounds like a step in the right direction. I appreciate you acknowledging that. Let's pull it up and start reviewing.,2024-09-03 21:39:02
11148,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_2,"Great, I've got the document open. Let's start with the introduction. Do you think the thesis statement is clear enough?",2024-09-03 21:46:02
11149,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_1,"It looks good, but I think we can make it stronger by adding a specific example. What do you think about mentioning that recent case study we discussed?",2024-09-03 21:54:02
11150,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_2,That's a good idea. Let me add that in. How about the methodology section? Anything you want to adjust there?,2024-09-03 22:03:02
11151,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_1,"Actually, yes. I think we should elaborate more on the data collection process. It seems a bit too brief.",2024-09-03 22:07:02
11152,deescalatory_conversation_185,speaker_2,Got it. I'll expand on that. Thanks for pointing,2024-09-03 22:11:02
11153,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,We need to talk about the presentation for the science fair.,2024-09-03 21:22:06
11154,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_2,"I know, I know. But you didn't tell me you changed the topic last minute.",2024-09-03 21:31:06
11155,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,"I had to, the original one wasn't approved by Mr. Stevens.",2024-09-03 21:34:06
11156,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_2,But you didn't even consult me about it! How am I supposed to prepare now?,2024-09-03 21:44:06
11157,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,"You're right, I should have talked to you first. Can we find a way to make this work together?",2024-09-03 21:52:06
11158,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_2,I guess we can. What exactly is the new topic?,2024-09-03 21:54:06
11159,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,"It's about renewable energy sources, specifically solar power. I have some initial research we can look at together.",2024-09-03 21:56:06
11160,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_2,"Alright, that sounds interesting. But we need to divide the work if we're going to get this done on time.",2024-09-03 22:02:06
11161,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,"Absolutely. How about I handle the introduction and conclusion, and you can take on the experiments and data analysis?",2024-09-03 22:10:06
11162,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_2,"Yeah, that works. Let’s set up a time to go over the research and experiments together.",2024-09-03 22:11:06
11163,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,How about tomorrow after school? We can use the library.,2024-09-03 22:16:06
11164,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_2,"Sure, that sounds good. Let’s just make sure to communicate better moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:24:06
11165,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,Agreed. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:31:06
11166,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_2,No problem. Let's do great on this project together.,2024-09-03 22:37:06
11167,deescalatory_conversation_186,speaker_1,Teamwork makes the dream work!,2024-09-03 22:45:06
11168,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_1,Why did you change the project layout without telling us?,2024-09-03 21:26:10
11169,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_2,I thought it would improve our presentation. The old layout was too cluttered.,2024-09-03 21:33:10
11170,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_3,But we agreed on the original format last week. You can't just make decisions without consulting us.,2024-09-03 21:37:10
11171,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_2,"I understand that, but we were running out of time, and I thought it was best for everyone.",2024-09-03 21:41:10
11172,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_1,Couldn't you at least have sent a quick message to let us know? We were all caught off guard during the review.,2024-09-03 21:49:10
11173,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_2,"You're right, I should've communicated better. I apologize for that.",2024-09-03 21:54:10
11174,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_3,We just need to make sure we're all on the same page next time. Communication is key.,2024-09-03 22:02:10
11175,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's set up a rule to update each other before making any changes.,2024-09-03 22:07:10
11176,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_1,That sounds like a good plan. Can we all commit to that?,2024-09-03 22:17:10
11177,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_3,Absolutely. Let's move forward and make this project the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:27:10
11178,deescalatory_conversation_187,speaker_2,"Thanks, everyone. I'll be sure to check in before making any further changes.",2024-09-03 22:28:10
11179,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,Why didn't you finish the project report on time?,2024-09-03 21:23:13
11180,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,I had too much on my plate with other assignments and work.,2024-09-03 21:26:13
11181,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,"We all have other commitments, but we agreed on this deadline weeks ago.",2024-09-03 21:33:13
11182,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,"I know, but unexpected things came up. Can we figure out a way to handle this together?",2024-09-03 21:43:13
11183,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,How do you think we can salvage it? The report is due tomorrow.,2024-09-03 21:46:13
11184,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,Maybe we can split the remaining sections between us and work on it tonight?,2024-09-03 21:53:13
11185,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,That could work. I'll take the analysis part. What section can you handle?,2024-09-03 21:59:13
11186,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,I can work on the conclusion and summary. Let's meet online to coordinate.,2024-09-03 22:00:13
11187,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,"Alright, let's set a time to meet online. How about 7 PM?",2024-09-03 22:01:13
11188,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,7 PM works for me. I'll gather my notes by then. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:03:13
11189,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,"Sure, let's get it done together. Can you also check the references list once you've finished the summary?",2024-09-03 22:09:13
11190,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,"Yes, I'll do that. Appreciate your help with this.",2024-09-03 22:13:13
11191,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_1,"No problem, let's make sure we submit a strong report. See you online at 7.",2024-09-03 22:16:13
11192,deescalatory_conversation_188,speaker_2,See you then!,2024-09-03 22:20:13
11193,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,"I saw you took my lunch from the fridge again, Tom. This has to stop.",2024-09-03 21:28:16
11194,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,"Oh, come on, Lisa. It was just a sandwich. I didn't think you'd mind.",2024-09-03 21:34:16
11195,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,"I do mind. That was my lunch, and I've talked to you about this before.",2024-09-03 21:35:16
11196,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,"I get it, but it's just food. You can't be that upset over a sandwich.",2024-09-03 21:45:16
11197,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,"It's not just about the sandwich; it's the principle. If you needed food, you could have asked.",2024-09-03 21:49:16
11198,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,"Okay, I understand now. You're right. I should've asked. Can I make it up to you?",2024-09-03 21:54:16
11199,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,Thank you for understanding. Maybe you can bring in some snacks or lunches to share for the next few days?,2024-09-03 21:57:16
11200,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'll start tomorrow. Thanks for being patient with me.,2024-09-03 22:07:16
11201,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, Tom. Let's try to respect each other's stuff from now on.",2024-09-03 22:17:16
11202,deescalatory_conversation_189,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Lisa. Let's keep the communication open.",2024-09-03 22:19:16
11203,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,Why didn't you take out the trash like I asked? The kitchen is a mess.,2024-09-03 21:21:18
11204,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,"I was busy with schoolwork, Mom. I told you I had a huge project due.",2024-09-03 21:31:18
11205,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,"I understand you're busy, but taking out the trash only takes a few minutes.",2024-09-03 21:38:18
11206,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,"I know, but I just got caught up and lost track of time. I'm sorry.",2024-09-03 21:43:18
11207,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,"Alright, I appreciate the apology. How about we set a specific time each day for you to handle it?",2024-09-03 21:52:18
11208,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,That might work. Maybe right after dinner?,2024-09-03 22:01:18
11209,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,After dinner sounds good. That way it's done before you dive back into your homework.,2024-09-03 22:05:18
11210,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,"Okay, I'll make sure to do it then. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:07:18
11211,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_1,"No problem. I know school is important, but keeping the house clean is too.",2024-09-03 22:17:18
11212,deescalatory_conversation_190,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll try to balance things better from now on.,2024-09-03 22:25:18
11213,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without telling any of us, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:24:22
11214,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,"I get that you're upset, Jake, but I honestly thought it was the best thing to do. We were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:30:22
11215,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_3,"Sarah, we had a plan to review it together. Now, if there's a mistake, we won't catch it until we get the grade back.",2024-09-03 21:39:22
11216,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,"I know, Lisa, but remember when we lost a whole day because of the school server issue? I didn't want to risk another problem.",2024-09-03 21:45:22
11217,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_1,But that doesn't mean you should make decisions for all of us. We need to work as a team.,2024-09-03 21:47:22
11218,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,"Okay, maybe I acted too quickly. But I felt a lot of pressure to meet the deadline and didn't want to let everyone down.",2024-09-03 21:48:22
11219,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_3,"We understand the pressure, Sarah, but we also had assigned roles. Ignoring them creates confusion and distrust.",2024-09-03 21:50:22
11220,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,"You're right, Lisa. Next time, I'll make sure to check in with everyone. But what can we do now to make this right?",2024-09-03 21:53:22
11221,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_1,"We can start by reviewing the final submission together. If there’s feedback or a chance to resubmit, we’ll know what to work on.",2024-09-03 22:03:22
11222,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_3,"Agreed, Jake. Sarah, can you resend the project file so we can go through it?",2024-09-03 22:04:22
11223,deescalatory_conversation_191,speaker_2,"Sure thing, Lisa. I'll",2024-09-03 22:09:22
11224,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_1,"Why did you take credit for the entire project, Sarah? We all worked on it together!",2024-09-03 21:23:26
11225,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_2,"I didn't take credit for everything, Mark. I just presented the parts I worked on.",2024-09-03 21:31:26
11226,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_1,It didn't come across that way. The boss thought you did all the work.,2024-09-03 21:34:26
11227,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_2,I see how that could be misunderstood. I’ll clarify that we all contributed.,2024-09-03 21:38:26
11228,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_3,"That would really help, Sarah. We’ve been feeling overlooked.",2024-09-03 21:40:26
11229,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_2,I understand. Let's schedule a meeting with the boss to explain everyone's roles.,2024-09-03 21:45:26
11230,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_1,"Okay, that sounds fair. Can we all agree on the next steps before we talk to him?",2024-09-03 21:51:26
11231,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_3,"Yes, let's make a detailed list of what each of us did.",2024-09-03 22:00:26
11232,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll draft it and send it to you both for feedback.,2024-09-03 22:03:26
11233,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate you addressing this.",2024-09-03 22:08:26
11234,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_3,Me too. Let's make sure next time we communicate more clearly from the start.,2024-09-03 22:13:26
11235,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_2,Absolutely. This was a learning moment for all of us. Let’s move forward together.,2024-09-03 22:19:26
11236,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_1,"Looking forward to it. Alright, we’ll speak to Dave tomorrow then?",2024-09-03 22:21:26
11237,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_3,"Yes, let's finalize the details tonight and be ready for the meeting.",2024-09-03 22:30:26
11238,deescalatory_conversation_192,speaker_2,Great plan. Thanks for working through this with me.,2024-09-03 22:31:26

11240,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the group project meeting, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:22:29
11241,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I had a family emergency. I should have let you know.",2024-09-03 21:28:29
11242,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_1,"You know, this isn't the first time you've left us hanging. We can't keep covering for you.",2024-09-03 21:38:29
11243,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_2,"I understand. It's been a tough month for me, but I promise I'll contribute more actively.",2024-09-03 21:46:29
11244,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_3,Maybe we can create a schedule to ensure everyone is contributing equally?,2024-09-03 21:54:29
11245,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_1,"That's a good idea. We just need to know we can rely on you, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:04:29
11246,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_2,"I agree, creating a schedule could help. I'll make sure to stick to it.",2024-09-03 22:13:29
11247,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_3,How about we also set up a WhatsApp group for quick updates if anyone faces any issues?,2024-09-03 22:18:29
11248,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_1,"That sounds great. Alex, are you okay with that?",2024-09-03 22:22:29
11249,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_2,"Yes, that works for me. Thank you for understanding, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:31:29
11250,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_3,"Alright, let's start fresh and focus on getting this project done well.",2024-09-03 22:39:29
11251,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks for being open to this, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:48:29
11252,deescalatory_conversation_193,speaker_2,Thank you all for your patience. Let's do this!,2024-09-03 22:51:29
11253,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_1,"Why did you take my notebook without asking, Jamie?",2024-09-03 21:22:32
11254,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_2,"I really needed it for the assignment, and you weren't around, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:24:32
11255,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_1,You could have texted me. I was just in the next room.,2024-09-03 21:31:32
11256,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have. I was just in a rush and didn't think.",2024-09-03 21:37:32
11257,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_1,It's just frustrating because I had all my notes in there.,2024-09-03 21:44:32
11258,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_2,I understand. I didn't mean to inconvenience you. How can I make it up to you?,2024-09-03 21:50:32
11259,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_1,"If you could help me organize my notes again, that would help a lot.",2024-09-03 21:56:32
11260,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_2,"Of course, I'd be happy to. Let's sit down and go through them together.",2024-09-03 22:01:32
11261,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jamie. Just try to ask next time, okay?",2024-09-03 22:04:32
11262,deescalatory_conversation_194,speaker_2,Definitely. I appreciate your understanding.,2024-09-03 22:10:32
11263,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,Why did you change the project presentation without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:27:35
11264,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,I thought the new version would be more effective for our pitch.,2024-09-03 21:29:35
11265,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,But you didn't ask for my input at all. We're supposed to be partners.,2024-09-03 21:34:35
11266,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,"I understand that. I'm sorry, I should have consulted you first.",2024-09-03 21:42:35
11267,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,"So, can we discuss these changes and make decisions together from now on?",2024-09-03 21:46:35
11268,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's sit down and go over everything right now.,2024-09-03 21:54:35
11269,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,"Alright, let's start with the new slide layout. Why did you make those changes?",2024-09-03 22:03:35
11270,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,I thought the old layout was too cluttered and might confuse the audience.,2024-09-03 22:06:35
11271,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,"I see your point. It does look cleaner, but I think we should keep the important data from the original version.",2024-09-03 22:11:35
11272,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,Agreed. How about we integrate the key points from your slides into the new layout?,2024-09-03 22:18:35
11273,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,"That sounds fair. And about the new color scheme, I feel like it's too harsh. Can we compromise on that?",2024-09-03 22:22:35
11274,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,"Sure, let's pick a palette that's both professional and easy on the eyes.",2024-09-03 22:32:35
11275,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_1,Thanks for being open to this. I think working together will make our project stronger.,2024-09-03 22:42:35
11276,deescalatory_conversation_195,speaker_2,I appreciate your input. Let's make this presentation the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:50:35
11277,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you delete my code from the group project without asking me first?",2024-09-03 21:29:39
11278,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,"I thought it was causing errors, so I removed it to troubleshoot. I didn't think it was a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:39:39
11279,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,It was a big deal! I spent hours working on that part. You could've at least sent me a message first.,2024-09-03 21:43:39
11280,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,"I'm sorry. I was in a hurry to meet the deadline. Next time, I'll definitely let you know before making any changes.",2024-09-03 21:44:39
11281,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,"I understand being rushed, but we need to communicate better. We're a team, and we should respect each other's work.",2024-09-03 21:52:39
11282,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,"You're absolutely right. Let's agree to always discuss changes in our group chat first, even if we're in a time crunch.",2024-09-03 21:56:39
11283,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Agreed. And maybe we can set up more frequent check-ins to avoid misunderstandings like this in the future.,2024-09-03 22:03:39
11284,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. It might also help us catch errors earlier and stay on track more easily.,2024-09-03 22:08:39
11285,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,Exactly. Let's make this project something we can both be proud of. We have the skills; we just need to keep communicating.,2024-09-03 22:18:39
11286,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_2,I'm with you on that. Thanks for bringing this up. I appreciate it.,2024-09-03 22:25:39
11287,deescalatory_conversation_196,speaker_1,No problem. Let's get back to it and finish strong.,2024-09-03 22:33:39
11288,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and changed the project outline without consulting me.,2024-09-03 21:22:43
11289,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,"Look, I thought it would be more efficient. The deadline is coming up fast.",2024-09-03 21:24:43
11290,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,But we agreed on a different approach. Now the whole team is confused.,2024-09-03 21:27:43
11291,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,I didn't mean to cause confusion. I genuinely thought it would help us stay on track.,2024-09-03 21:30:43
11292,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,"Well, it didn't. Can we please stick to what we originally planned?",2024-09-03 21:32:43
11293,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,Let's discuss what specifically is causing the confusion. Maybe we can blend our ideas?,2024-09-03 21:36:43
11294,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,"Okay, that's fair. The main issue is the new section you added—it doesn't align with the other parts.",2024-09-03 21:42:43
11295,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,I see what you mean. How about we adjust that section together to make it fit better?,2024-09-03 21:52:43
11296,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,"That could work. If we focus on integration, we might be able to salvage this.",2024-09-03 21:56:43
11297,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's schedule a team meeting to go over the changes so everyone is on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:57:43
11298,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_1,"Sounds good. And next time, let's make sure to discuss changes like this beforehand.",2024-09-03 21:58:43
11299,deescalatory_conversation_197,speaker_2,Absolutely. Communication is key. Let's get this project back on track.,2024-09-03 22:02:43
11300,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the game?,2024-09-03 21:27:46
11301,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, I swear.",2024-09-03 21:37:46
11302,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,You looked right at me and then turned away!,2024-09-03 21:46:46
11303,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,"Maybe I did, but I was focused on avoiding the defenders.",2024-09-03 21:53:46
11304,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,You always have an excuse. This keeps happening.,2024-09-03 21:58:46
11305,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,"Look, I get it. You're frustrated. But I'm trying my best out there.",2024-09-03 22:07:46
11306,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,Your best should include being a team player.,2024-09-03 22:09:46
11307,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,I understand that. How about we coordinate better at practice?,2024-09-03 22:13:46
11308,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,That sounds good. We do need to work on our communication.,2024-09-03 22:21:46
11309,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,"Exactly, and if you feel left out, just call my name louder next time.",2024-09-03 22:29:46
11310,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,I'll do that. Let's make sure this doesn't affect our game again.,2024-09-03 22:39:46
11311,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,Deal. And I'll make an effort to keep an eye out for your moves.,2024-09-03 22:45:46
11312,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_1,"Thanks, that means a lot. We both want to win, right?",2024-09-03 22:48:46
11313,deescalatory_conversation_198,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's focus on that together.,2024-09-03 22:56:46
11314,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back on this, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:30:49
11315,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Jake?",2024-09-03 21:40:49
11316,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,You know exactly what I mean. You submitted the project without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:44:49
11317,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"I thought it was due today. We couldn't afford to wait, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:54:49
11318,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,"Still, a heads-up would have been nice.",2024-09-03 22:03:49
11319,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have told you. But we didn't have much time left.",2024-09-03 22:06:49
11320,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,"I understand that, but we're supposed to be partners.",2024-09-03 22:07:49
11321,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,I apologize. It was a rushed decision.,2024-09-03 22:11:49
11322,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,Can we focus on how to fix this now?,2024-09-03 22:16:49
11323,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"Yes, let's go over the feedback we received and make improvements.",2024-09-03 22:21:49
11324,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,"Alright, I’ll check the sections on methodology.",2024-09-03 22:27:49
11325,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,"Great, I'll handle the data analysis part.",2024-09-03 22:28:49
11326,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,Let’s meet in an hour to compare notes.,2024-09-03 22:33:49
11327,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_2,Sounds good. We can do this together.,2024-09-03 22:37:49
11328,deescalatory_conversation_199,speaker_1,"Agreed, let's finish strong.",2024-09-03 22:44:49
11329,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,We need to talk about the presentation. I feel like I did most of the work.,2024-09-03 21:30:53
11330,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,That's not fair. I contributed a lot too.,2024-09-03 21:40:53
11331,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,Can you tell me more about what you contributed? I might have missed it.,2024-09-03 21:41:53
11332,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,I helped research the first two sections and put together the slides for those parts.,2024-09-03 21:46:53
11333,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,And I want to add that I did the entire conclusion and summary slide.,2024-09-03 21:54:53
11334,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,"Okay, maybe I didn't notice because I was focused on the design and flow.",2024-09-03 22:04:53
11335,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,It's possible. I did see that you spent a lot of time making everything look good.,2024-09-03 22:07:53
11336,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,"We all played a role, but it sounds like we need better communication.",2024-09-03 22:13:53
11337,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,Agreed. Maybe next time we should have regular check-ins.,2024-09-03 22:14:53
11338,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. It would help us stay on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:18:53
11339,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,Absolutely. We should also divide tasks more clearly from the start.,2024-09-03 22:26:53
11340,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,Thanks for discussing this with me. I don't want any hard feelings.,2024-09-03 22:33:53
11341,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,"Same here. We're a team, after all.",2024-09-03 22:37:53
11342,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,"Yeah, let's move forward and remember to communicate better next time.",2024-09-03 22:43:53
11343,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_1,Perfect. Let's crush the presentation tomorrow together.,2024-09-03 22:47:53
11344,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_2,We got this!,2024-09-03 22:51:53
11345,deescalatory_conversation_200,speaker_3,Absolutely!,2024-09-03 23:00:53
11346,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,"Why did you leave the project halfway through, Sarah? We were counting on you.",2024-09-03 21:30:56
11347,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"I didn't leave it halfway through, Mark. I just needed a break; it was getting too overwhelming.",2024-09-03 21:31:56
11348,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,But you didn't tell anyone. We were left scrambling to cover for you.,2024-09-03 21:32:56
11349,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"I understand how it looks, but I really thought I could manage it on my own. I should have communicated better.",2024-09-03 21:36:56
11350,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_3,"Everyone is stressed, Sarah. We appreciate your efforts but leaving without a word affected all of us.",2024-09-03 21:41:56
11351,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry for that. Can we work together to find a solution for next time?",2024-09-03 21:42:56
11352,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,That’s a start. Maybe we can set up a system to check in on each other’s progress more regularly?,2024-09-03 21:43:56
11353,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_3,"Regular check-ins could help. Also, having a backup plan for when someone feels overwhelmed might be beneficial.",2024-09-03 21:48:56
11354,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,"I agree. If we had a backup plan, I wouldn’t have felt so pressured to manage everything alone.",2024-09-03 21:56:56
11355,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_1,"Great, let's prioritize creating that plan first. Meanwhile, Sarah, can you rejoin us in the project?",2024-09-03 21:59:56
11356,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’m ready to help and make up for the time lost.,2024-09-03 22:08:56
11357,deescalatory_conversation_201,speaker_3,Perfect. Let's move forward together and finish this on a strong note.,2024-09-03 22:14:56
11358,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me earlier that we were behind schedule on the presentation?,2024-09-03 21:25:59
11359,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,"I thought I could catch up, but things got out of hand.",2024-09-03 21:30:59
11360,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,We need to communicate better. This affects both of us.,2024-09-03 21:31:59
11361,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,You're right. I should've been more upfront about the delays I was facing.,2024-09-03 21:32:59
11362,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,"Moving forward, let's set more frequent check-ins to avoid this.",2024-09-03 21:39:59
11363,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,Agreed. Can we salvage what we have so far?,2024-09-03 21:40:59
11364,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,"Yes, we just need to divide the remaining tasks. I'll handle the slides; can you focus on the research?",2024-09-03 21:46:59
11365,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,"Definitely, I'll get started on that right away.",2024-09-03 21:55:59
11366,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,Great. Let's aim to have our parts done by tomorrow evening.,2024-09-03 22:01:59
11367,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:03:59
11368,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_1,"No problem. We're a team, and we need to support each other.",2024-09-03 22:09:59
11369,deescalatory_conversation_202,speaker_2,Absolutely. We'll get through this together.,2024-09-03 22:19:59
11370,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted the group project without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:26:03
11371,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,I thought we agreed I would handle the final submission. What's the problem?,2024-09-03 21:34:03
11372,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,The problem is you didn't include any of my revisions. It looks incomplete and doesn't reflect what we worked on together.,2024-09-03 21:41:03
11373,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,I didn't realize you had additional revisions. Why didn't you share them with me before the deadline?,2024-09-03 21:46:03
11374,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,I did! I sent them to you two days ago. Did you not check your email?,2024-09-03 21:51:03
11375,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,"Oh, I must have missed that. This is my fault. I should have double-checked. Can we submit an updated version?",2024-09-03 21:55:03
11376,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,I hope so. But this isn't the first time you've missed important details.,2024-09-03 22:00:03
11377,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,I understand. Let's figure out a better way to communicate so this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:01:03
11378,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,Maybe we should set up a shared document for revisions next time.,2024-09-03 22:07:03
11379,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,Agreed. I’m sorry I overlooked your work. Let’s see if the professor will accept a resubmission.,2024-09-03 22:11:03
11380,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_1,Alright. I’ll reach out to the professor and explain the situation.,2024-09-03 22:19:03
11381,deescalatory_conversation_203,speaker_2,Great. And thanks for bringing this up calmly. Let’s make sure our project reflects both our efforts.,2024-09-03 22:27:03
11382,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,I can't believe you just made that decision without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:22:06
11383,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was that big of a deal, and we were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:27:06
11384,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,But we agreed we would talk about every major move in our project!,2024-09-03 21:32:06
11385,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,"I know, but the deadline is in two days, and I thought it would be better to at least get something done.",2024-09-03 21:41:06
11386,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,Something done without my input isn't what we agreed on. We've always worked together on decisions like these.,2024-09-03 21:49:06
11387,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,"You're right, we have. I should've consulted you before finalizing it. Can we review it together now?",2024-09-03 21:54:06
11388,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,"Yes, I appreciate that. But we need to make sure we respect our previous agreements.",2024-09-03 21:56:06
11389,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's take a look at what I added and see if we can improve it together.,2024-09-03 22:00:06
11390,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,"Okay, that sounds fair. I did have a couple of ideas I wanted to share anyway.",2024-09-03 22:09:06
11391,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,Great! I'd love to hear them. Let's make sure this project reflects both our perspectives.,2024-09-03 22:16:06
11392,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,Thanks. I think the section on customer feedback could use a bit more emphasis on data analysis.,2024-09-03 22:18:06
11393,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_2,Good point. I also think we could expand on the marketing strategies section to include more social media approaches.,2024-09-03 22:23:06
11394,deescalatory_conversation_204,speaker_1,"Agreed, that would make our project stronger. Let's combine our efforts and finish strong.",2024-09-03 22:30:06
11395,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the last quarter? We could have won the game if you hadn't been so selfish!,2024-09-03 21:30:10
11396,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,I wasn't trying to be selfish. I thought I had a better shot at making the basket.,2024-09-03 21:31:10
11397,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,"But you missed, and now we've lost because you didn't trust the team.",2024-09-03 21:35:10
11398,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but it wasn't just about not passing to you. The defense was tight, and I had to make a split-second decision.",2024-09-03 21:43:10
11399,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_3,"Everyone, let's calm down. We all made mistakes, not just speaker_2. Blaming isn't going to help us win the next game.",2024-09-03 21:53:10
11400,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,"I get that, but this keeps happening. How can we trust each other if we're not playing as a team?",2024-09-03 21:54:10
11401,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,"You're right, speaker_1. I need to work on trusting you all more during those crucial moments.",2024-09-03 21:56:10
11402,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_3,And we need to communicate better on the court. Maybe we should practice some plays that involve more passing.,2024-09-03 21:58:10
11403,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. I don't want us losing because we can't work together.,2024-09-03 22:00:10
11404,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's focus on being more cohesive as a team moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:02:10
11405,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_3,"So, we're all on the same page then? More communication and trust in each other?",2024-09-03 22:03:10
11406,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_1,Definitely. I'm willing to put in the effort if everyone else is.,2024-09-03 22:09:10
11407,deescalatory_conversation_205,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:18:10
11408,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,Why did you change the project without telling me first?,2024-09-03 21:28:13
11409,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,I thought it needed some improvements. Do you not like the changes?,2024-09-03 21:38:13
11410,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,"It's not that I don't like them, but we should've discussed it together.",2024-09-03 21:42:13
11411,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,I see your point. I should've included you in the decision-making process.,2024-09-03 21:47:13
11412,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,Exactly. Teamwork is important. How do you think we can avoid this in the future?,2024-09-03 21:48:13
11413,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,Maybe we should set up regular check-ins to discuss any potential changes.,2024-09-03 21:49:13
11414,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,That sounds good. We can update each other more frequently.,2024-09-03 21:56:13
11415,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,"Agreed. Also, I'll make sure to get your feedback before implementing anything major.",2024-09-03 22:00:13
11416,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_1,I appreciate that. I just want to make sure we're aligned.,2024-09-03 22:06:13
11417,deescalatory_conversation_206,speaker_2,"Absolutely. We're a team, and your input is valuable.",2024-09-03 22:16:13
11418,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,"Why did you leave the art supplies all over the classroom, Jake?",2024-09-03 21:25:16
11419,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"I was in a rush, okay? I had to get to soccer practice.",2024-09-03 21:35:16
11420,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_3,"Yeah, but we're a team, and now Mrs. Thompson is mad at all of us.",2024-09-03 21:36:16
11421,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?,2024-09-03 21:42:16
11422,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,"Look, we just want to find a way to make sure this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 21:51:16
11423,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_3,Maybe we can come up with a cleanup schedule so everyone's responsible.,2024-09-03 21:57:16
11424,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"That might work. I don't like being rushed, though.",2024-09-03 22:07:16
11425,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,How about we set a timer five minutes before the bell to start cleaning up?,2024-09-03 22:15:16
11426,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_3,And we can all remind each other when it's time. It's a team effort.,2024-09-03 22:18:16
11427,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can do that. It sounds fair.",2024-09-03 22:26:16
11428,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,"Great, let's put it on a calendar so we stick to it.",2024-09-03 22:30:16
11429,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_3,"And if people forget, we won't blame anyone. We just remind each other.",2024-09-03 22:35:16
11430,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,"Deal. Thanks, guys.",2024-09-03 22:44:16
11431,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_1,Glad we could figure this out together.,2024-09-03 22:53:16
11432,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_3,Now let's make sure Mrs. Thompson sees we're taking this seriously.,2024-09-03 22:57:16
11433,deescalatory_conversation_207,speaker_2,Agreed.,2024-09-03 23:07:16
11434,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,Why didn’t you pass the ball to me in the last play? We could have scored!,2024-09-03 21:24:19
11435,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,"I didn’t see you open, sorry. I thought I had a better shot at the goal.",2024-09-03 21:33:19
11436,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,"But you missed, and now we're losing. We need to communicate better.",2024-09-03 21:37:19
11437,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,You're right. I should have checked for other options before taking the shot.,2024-09-03 21:42:19
11438,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_3,"Guys, we're focusing too much on that one play. We have the whole second half to turn this around.",2024-09-03 21:52:19
11439,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,"True, but if we don't work together, we'll keep making the same mistakes.",2024-09-03 21:55:19
11440,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,I agree. Let's come up with a strategy for better coordination.,2024-09-03 21:58:19
11441,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_3,"How about we set specific signals for passes and shots, so everyone knows what’s happening on the field?",2024-09-03 22:08:19
11442,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,"That's a good idea. Also, let’s make sure to talk more during the game. Clear and loud.",2024-09-03 22:14:19
11443,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,Sounds good. I’ll definitely act on that. We’re a team and we need to act like one.,2024-09-03 22:15:19
11444,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_3,"Alright, let’s refocus and give our best in the second half. We’ve got this!",2024-09-03 22:23:19
11445,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_1,Agreed. Let’s leave the past behind and play smarter from now on.,2024-09-03 22:31:19
11446,deescalatory_conversation_208,speaker_2,Right. Let's go out there and give it our all.,2024-09-03 22:37:19
11447,deescalatory_conversation_209,**Scenario,A sports team arguing after repeatedly losing games.**,2024-09-03 21:31:23
11448,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,We've lost three games in a row. What's going on?,2024-09-03 21:37:23
11449,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,"Maybe if you passed the ball, we'd have a chance!",2024-09-03 21:38:23
11450,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,It’s not just about passing. Our defense has been terrible too.,2024-09-03 21:45:23
11451,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,"Defense starts with communication, and we're not talking on the court.",2024-09-03 21:47:23
11452,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,It's hard to communicate when everyone's always yelling.,2024-09-03 21:55:23
11453,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,"True, but we need more effort from everyone.",2024-09-03 22:02:23
11454,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,How about we set up a team meeting to discuss strategies?,2024-09-03 22:12:23
11455,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. We need a plan we all agree on.,2024-09-03 22:18:23
11456,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,And let’s make sure everyone gets to share their thoughts.,2024-09-03 22:28:23
11457,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,"Yes, and we should focus on positive feedback, not just criticism.",2024-09-03 22:32:23
11458,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,"Agreed. We all need to step up, but we should support each other.",2024-09-03 22:39:23
11459,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,"So, meeting after practice tomorrow?",2024-09-03 22:40:23
11460,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_1,"Works for me. Let’s turn this around, together.",2024-09-03 22:47:23
11461,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_2,"Yeah, we can do this as a team.",2024-09-03 22:57:23
11462,deescalatory_conversation_209,speaker_3,Absolutely. We’re stronger together.,2024-09-03 22:59:23
11463,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball in the last five minutes of the game!,2024-09-03 21:25:25
11464,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, and I thought I had a better shot.",2024-09-03 21:34:25
11465,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,We've practiced that play hundreds of times. You know I always cut to the corner!,2024-09-03 21:42:25
11466,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,"I know, I just got caught up in the moment. I'm sorry.",2024-09-03 21:44:25
11467,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,It's not just this game. You've been hogging the ball a lot lately.,2024-09-03 21:52:25
11468,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,I didn't realize you felt that way. I thought I was just trying to take responsibility.,2024-09-03 21:54:25
11469,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,"We've got to work as a team, or we'll keep losing like this.",2024-09-03 22:02:25
11470,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,You're right. I need to trust my teammates more.,2024-09-03 22:12:25
11471,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,"And I'll make sure to call out when I'm open, so there's no confusion.",2024-09-03 22:21:25
11472,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,That sounds good. Let's practice more communication during plays.,2024-09-03 22:25:25
11473,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_1,Agreed. We're stronger together when we're on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:31:25
11474,deescalatory_conversation_210,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's focus on that in our next practice.,2024-09-03 22:40:25
11475,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:29:29
11476,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,I had a lot going on and couldn't make it. I thought you guys would manage.,2024-09-03 21:35:29
11477,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,"We really needed your input. This project is for all of us, not just a few.",2024-09-03 21:42:29
11478,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. Can I help with the parts I missed?",2024-09-03 21:46:29
11479,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,"We had a tough time dividing the tasks without you. But yes, we could use your help now.",2024-09-03 21:48:29
11480,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,"Alright, let’s go over what needs to be done. What parts should I focus on?",2024-09-03 21:57:29
11481,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,We still need research on the market analysis and someone to put together the presentation slides.,2024-09-03 22:00:29
11482,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,I can handle the market analysis. I owe you guys that much.,2024-09-03 22:05:29
11483,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,That would be a huge help. Are you sure you can manage it with your schedule?,2024-09-03 22:13:29
11484,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,I’ll make the time. This project is important to me too. I didn’t mean to slack off.,2024-09-03 22:19:29
11485,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,"Okay, thanks. Let’s just keep communicating better. We’re all a team.",2024-09-03 22:23:29
11486,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll finish the market analysis by tomorrow morning. Anything else?,2024-09-03 22:32:29
11487,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_1,"No, that's it for now. Appreciate your willingness to catch up.",2024-09-03 22:33:29
11488,deescalatory_conversation_211,speaker_2,I appreciate the understanding. Let’s make this project great together.,2024-09-03 22:43:29
11489,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you're so upset about this, Dave.",2024-09-03 21:28:33
11490,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"I'm upset because you didn't share any of the project updates with the team, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:30:33
11491,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,I thought you were handling the communication with the team.,2024-09-03 21:34:33
11492,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"I was, but I needed the updates from you to include in my emails.",2024-09-03 21:43:33
11493,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,"I see, that was a miscommunication. I assumed you were getting the updates directly from the project tracker.",2024-09-03 21:50:33
11494,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"The project tracker hasn't been up to date, which is why I needed your input.",2024-09-03 21:56:33
11495,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,I apologize for that. I didn't realize it was an issue. How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 22:06:33
11496,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,Maybe we could have a quick check-in meeting every morning to go over updates before sending out any communications.,2024-09-03 22:16:33
11497,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,That sounds like a good plan. I'm on board with that.,2024-09-03 22:26:33
11498,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,Great. And I'll make sure to let the team know about the new process.,2024-09-03 22:30:33
11499,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,"Perfect. I'll also start updating the project tracker more frequently, just in case.",2024-09-03 22:40:33
11500,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_2,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate you being willing to work on this together.",2024-09-03 22:47:33
11501,deescalatory_conversation_212,speaker_1,"No problem, Dave. Let's move forward and make this project a success.",2024-09-03 22:55:33
11502,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,Why did you not pass me the ball during the entire game?,2024-09-03 21:31:37
11503,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"Because every time I did, you missed the shot.",2024-09-03 21:35:37
11504,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,But how am I supposed to get better if you don't give me the chance?,2024-09-03 21:44:37
11505,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"Practice more, and then I'll have confidence in your skills.",2024-09-03 21:52:37
11506,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,It's hard to practice when no one believes in me. Can't we encourage each other to improve?,2024-09-03 22:02:37
11507,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"I get that, but when we're in a game, we need to focus on winning.",2024-09-03 22:05:37
11508,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,"I understand winning is important, but teamwork is crucial too. We can't win if we don't work together.",2024-09-03 22:11:37
11509,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"You're right, maybe I was a bit too focused on the score instead of the team.",2024-09-03 22:21:37
11510,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,And I appreciate that. Let's try to balance it better next time.,2024-09-03 22:24:37
11511,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'll make sure to give you more opportunities, and you keep practicing.",2024-09-03 22:26:37
11512,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_1,"Deal. We're all in this together, after all.",2024-09-03 22:36:37
11513,deescalatory_conversation_213,speaker_2,Exactly. Let's get back to practice and keep improving as a team.,2024-09-03 22:44:37
11514,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Why did you leave me out of the group presentation planning? We've been friends for years, Emma.",2024-09-03 21:29:40
11515,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,"I didn't leave you out on purpose, Jack. I thought you were busy with your track meet.",2024-09-03 21:38:40
11516,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,But you didn't even ask! It feels like you guys don't value my input.,2024-09-03 21:42:40
11517,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,That's not true at all. We just didn't want to stress you out more than you already were.,2024-09-03 21:46:40
11518,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,I'd rather be included and know what's happening. I can balance both.,2024-09-03 21:52:40
11519,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,I understand now. How about we make sure you're part of the final presentation review?,2024-09-03 21:59:40
11520,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"That would help, but I still feel hurt. This isn't the first time something like this has happened.",2024-09-03 22:02:40
11521,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Jack. Can we set a better communication plan so it doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 22:07:40
11522,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Okay, I think we should have more regular check-ins, at least weekly.",2024-09-03 22:09:40
11523,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. Let's set up a time that works for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:19:40
11524,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Deal. And next time, please just ask me directly if you think I'm too busy.",2024-09-03 22:28:40
11525,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'm really sorry, again. Let's make this presentation the best it can be.",2024-09-03 22:36:40
11526,deescalatory_conversation_214,speaker_1,"Thanks, Emma. I appreciate you understanding. Let's do our best!",2024-09-03 22:40:40
11527,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"Hey, did you mess with my project plans?",2024-09-03 21:28:44
11528,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"What do you mean, mess with your plans? I didn't touch anything.",2024-09-03 21:34:44
11529,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"My timeline has been altered, and I know you had access to it.",2024-09-03 21:43:44
11530,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"Look, I may have seen the plans, but I didn't change anything on purpose. Maybe it was an accident.",2024-09-03 21:47:44
11531,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,An accident? How do you accidentally change a whole timeline?,2024-09-03 21:48:44
11532,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"I don't know, maybe I clicked something without noticing. Can we just look at it together?",2024-09-03 21:58:44
11533,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"Fine, let's open it up and see what's different.",2024-09-03 22:06:44
11534,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"Okay, see, here—it looks like only the deadlines shifted. Was there a specific date off?",2024-09-03 22:07:44
11535,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"Yeah, this one here is a week earlier than I had it. That really throws things off.",2024-09-03 22:17:44
11536,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,"I get that, and I'm sorry. Can we adjust it back and maybe put in some safeguards?",2024-09-03 22:20:44
11537,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,Safeguards like what?,2024-09-03 22:21:44
11538,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,Like tracking changes or restricting who can edit. Just until the project is done.,2024-09-03 22:29:44
11539,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,That makes sense. Let’s do that so this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:30:44
11540,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's update it now and add those safeguards. I'm genuinely sorry about the mess-up.,2024-09-03 22:33:44
11541,deescalatory_conversation_215,speaker_1,"It's alright, thanks for helping fix it. Let’s just double-check everything’s in order.",2024-09-03 22:36:44
11542,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,"Why are you always late for our band practice, Matt?",2024-09-03 21:27:48
11543,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,"It's not like I'm purposely trying to be late, Sarah. I have a lot going on.",2024-09-03 21:34:48
11544,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,"We all have busy schedules, but we make time for this because it's important.",2024-09-03 21:35:48
11545,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,"I know it's important, but my part-time job runs late sometimes.",2024-09-03 21:39:48
11546,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,Can we find a way to adjust practice times that work for everyone?,2024-09-03 21:41:48
11547,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,We've already moved practice times twice. It's frustrating to keep changing plans.,2024-09-03 21:46:48
11548,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,"I get that, but communication would help. If you let me know earlier, I can try to rearrange things.",2024-09-03 21:53:48
11549,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,Maybe we can set a fixed alternate day for practice when someone can't make it?,2024-09-03 21:57:48
11550,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,"Okay, but we need commitment. We can't prepare for gigs if we're not all here.",2024-09-03 22:07:48
11551,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,I'll do my best to let you know my schedule in advance. Can everyone else do the same?,2024-09-03 22:12:48
11552,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,That sounds fair. We can share our weekly schedules to find consistency.,2024-09-03 22:18:48
11553,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's try sharing our schedules for the next month and see how it works.,2024-09-03 22:21:48
11554,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,"Thanks for being understanding, guys. I'll make sure to communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:25:48
11555,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,"And if anyone's schedule changes, let's update right away. Deal?",2024-09-03 22:33:48
11556,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_1,Deal.,2024-09-03 22:43:48
11557,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_2,Deal.,2024-09-03 22:45:48
11558,deescalatory_conversation_216,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:46:48
11559,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my files, Tim?",2024-09-03 21:31:51
11560,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"I didn't delete them on purpose, Jen. It was an accident.",2024-09-03 21:34:51
11561,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,An accident? Those files took me weeks to compile!,2024-09-03 21:36:51
11562,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"I understand, and I'm really sorry. I can help you recover them. Have you checked the recycle bin?",2024-09-03 21:45:51
11563,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,"Yeah, I did. They're not there.",2024-09-03 21:53:51
11564,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"Okay, let's think this through. Were the files backed up anywhere?",2024-09-03 22:02:51
11565,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,They're supposed to auto-backup to the cloud. I will check.,2024-09-03 22:04:51
11566,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"Good idea. If they're not there, we can try using recovery software.",2024-09-03 22:08:51
11567,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,"Alright, I'll check the cloud first. Thanks for trying to help.",2024-09-03 22:18:51
11568,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"Of course. If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.",2024-09-03 22:20:51
11569,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_1,"Will do. Let's make sure this never happens again, okay?",2024-09-03 22:30:51
11570,deescalatory_conversation_217,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Let's set up a regular manual backup too, just to be safe.",2024-09-03 22:34:51
11571,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,"Tim, why didn't you finish the group project on time? We were counting on you.",2024-09-03 21:31:56
11572,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,"I had other assignments too, Rachel. It’s not like I was just sitting around.",2024-09-03 21:33:56
11573,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,But we divided the work equally. Everyone had other assignments.,2024-09-03 21:35:56
11574,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_3,"Guys, let's try to understand what happened. Tim, was there a specific issue that caused the delay?",2024-09-03 21:45:56
11575,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,I guess I underestimated how much time the research part would take. I should have spoken up earlier. I'm sorry.,2024-09-03 21:51:56
11576,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,"Okay, I appreciate that, Tim. But next time, just let us know ahead of time so we can help.",2024-09-03 22:00:56
11577,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_3,"Rachel's right. If we communicate better, we can avoid this in the future.",2024-09-03 22:03:56
11578,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,You're right. I’ll make sure I do that next time. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:04:56
11579,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,"Alright, let's move forward. How can we tackle the remaining parts together?",2024-09-03 22:07:56
11580,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_3,I can take on some of Tim’s remaining sections if that helps.,2024-09-03 22:17:56
11581,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,I’ll also work extra hard to make up for the delay. Maybe we can set up a meeting this weekend to finish up.,2024-09-03 22:23:56
11582,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_1,Sounds good to me. Let’s use this experience to improve our teamwork.,2024-09-03 22:31:56
11583,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_3,"Agreed. We got this, guys.",2024-09-03 22:38:56
11584,deescalatory_conversation_218,speaker_2,"Thanks, everyone. I appreciate the support.",2024-09-03 22:47:56
11585,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,"You always take the best spot when we park for the band practice, and it's really frustrating.",2024-09-03 21:26:59
11586,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,I didn't realize it bothered you that much. Why didn't you say anything before?,2024-09-03 21:29:59
11587,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,I thought it was obvious since we have a rotation system. Can we just stick to it?,2024-09-03 21:33:59
11588,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,Fair point. I'll make sure to pay more attention to the rotation. Anything else that's been on your mind?,2024-09-03 21:35:59
11589,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,"Well, I also feel like I'm doing more set-up than everyone else. Can we distribute tasks more evenly?",2024-09-03 21:45:59
11590,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,"I can see that. How about we make a quick checklist of who does what, so no one feels overloaded?",2024-09-03 21:47:59
11591,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,That would be helpful. Maybe we can add it to our group chat so everyone can see it and pitch in.,2024-09-03 21:56:59
11592,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,Great idea. I'll draft something up tonight and share it with the group. Anything else to discuss?,2024-09-03 22:05:59
11593,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,"No, I think that covers my main concerns. Thanks for being understanding.",2024-09-03 22:13:59
11594,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,No problem. Thanks for bringing it up. It's important we all feel good about our practice sessions.,2024-09-03 22:15:59
11595,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_1,Agreed. Looking forward to a smoother process next time.,2024-09-03 22:22:59
11596,deescalatory_conversation_219,speaker_2,Same here. I'll see you at practice.,2024-09-03 22:23:59
11597,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and told the coach I wasn't performing well.,2024-09-03 21:30:02
11598,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,I told him because I thought it would help the team. We're all struggling right now.,2024-09-03 21:35:02
11599,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,But you didn't even talk to me first! How are we supposed to trust each other if you do stuff like that?,2024-09-03 21:42:02
11600,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have talked to you first. I was just worried about our performance.",2024-09-03 21:52:02
11601,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_3,"Hey, let's calm down, both of you. We're a team. Maybe we should focus on how we can all improve together.",2024-09-03 21:55:02
11602,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_1,"Fine, but it really hurt me. Can we agree to communicate better from now on?",2024-09-03 22:03:02
11603,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_2,Absolutely. I don't want any of us to feel undermined. Let's have a team meeting later and discuss our issues openly.,2024-09-03 22:06:02
11604,deescalatory_conversation_220,speaker_3,That sounds like a good plan. We all want the same thing—to win as a team and support each other.,2024-09-03 22:11:02
11605,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you pass the ball to me? I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:32:05
11606,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_2,"I didn't see you, alright? I was trying to make a play.",2024-09-03 21:39:05
11607,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_3,"Guys, let's focus. We're all on the same team here.",2024-09-03 21:48:05
11608,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,"I know, but we keep missing chances because we're not communicating.",2024-09-03 21:54:05
11609,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_2,"Fine, let's talk about it. What can we do to improve?",2024-09-03 22:03:05
11610,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_3,"Maybe we can call out our positions more loudly. That way, we'll know where everyone is.",2024-09-03 22:08:05
11611,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,"I can do that. And, let's try to keep our heads up more when we're dribbling.",2024-09-03 22:11:05
11612,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_2,Agreed. And I'll work on looking for open teammates before I make a play.,2024-09-03 22:20:05
11613,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_3,"Good, this is progress. We can also go over some strategies after practice.",2024-09-03 22:23:05
11614,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,"Sounds good to me. I just want us to play our best, you know?",2024-09-03 22:31:05
11615,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_2,Same here. Let's get back out there and win this.,2024-09-03 22:35:05
11616,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_3,"Alright, team on three!",2024-09-03 22:39:05
11617,deescalatory_conversation_221,speaker_1,"One, two, three...",2024-09-03 22:41:05
11618,deescalatory_conversation_221,"speaker_1, speaker_2, speaker_3",Team!,2024-09-03 22:45:05
11619,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,"Why did you take my phone without asking, Josh?",2024-09-03 21:25:08
11620,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_2,"I just needed to make a quick call, Sarah. Your phone was right there.",2024-09-03 21:31:08
11621,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,But you could have asked me first. It's my personal space.,2024-09-03 21:36:08
11622,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I didn't think it would be such a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:38:08
11623,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,It feels like you don't respect my things. This isn't the first time.,2024-09-03 21:41:08
11624,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_2,I see what you mean. I should've asked. Can we talk about how to handle this better in the future?,2024-09-03 21:48:08
11625,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,"Yeah, we should. Maybe let's set some boundaries on borrowing stuff.",2024-09-03 21:49:08
11626,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_2,"That's fair. How about we always ask first, no matter what it is?",2024-09-03 21:56:08
11627,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,"I like that idea. And if it's urgent, we can explain why as we ask.",2024-09-03 22:02:08
11628,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_2,Agreed. I promise to respect your space more.,2024-09-03 22:12:08
11629,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_1,"Thanks, Josh. I appreciate you understanding.",2024-09-03 22:18:08
11630,deescalatory_conversation_222,speaker_2,"No problem, Sarah. Let's move forward from this.",2024-09-03 22:26:08
11631,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,Why did you take my bike without asking?,2024-09-03 21:28:12
11632,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,"I needed to get to practice, and you weren’t around.",2024-09-03 21:37:12
11633,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,"You could have called me or left a note. This isn’t the first time, you know.",2024-09-03 21:46:12
11634,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,"I get that, but it was an emergency. I couldn’t miss practice.",2024-09-03 21:55:12
11635,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,All I’m asking is some respect for my stuff. Why is that so hard?,2024-09-03 22:02:12
11636,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,I see where you're coming from. I should have tried harder to reach you.,2024-09-03 22:05:12
11637,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,And what if something had happened to my bike? Who would be responsible?,2024-09-03 22:07:12
11638,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,I would. I’d make sure to cover any damages.,2024-09-03 22:11:12
11639,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,"Alright, but that doesn’t fix the trust issue here. How do I know you won’t do this again?",2024-09-03 22:19:12
11640,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,"Maybe we can set some boundaries. Like, what’s okay to borrow and what isn’t?",2024-09-03 22:25:12
11641,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I just want to feel like my stuff is safe here.,2024-09-03 22:32:12
11642,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I’ll make sure to ask next time, no matter what.",2024-09-03 22:34:12
11643,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate your understanding.,2024-09-03 22:42:12
11644,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,And I appreciate you letting me explain. We good?,2024-09-03 22:51:12
11645,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_1,"Yeah, we’re good. Just keep your word, okay?",2024-09-03 23:01:12
11646,deescalatory_conversation_223,speaker_2,I will. Thanks for talking this through.,2024-09-03 23:11:12
11647,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted our group project presentation without checking with us first.,2024-09-03 21:23:15
11648,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,"I had to get it done before the deadline, and no one else was responding in the group chat.",2024-09-03 21:33:15
11649,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,"We all were busy, but we should have had a chance to review it. There were some errors in the slides.",2024-09-03 21:41:15
11650,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_3,I noticed that too. We needed more time to make it perfect.,2024-09-03 21:45:15
11651,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,"I understand your frustration, but I thought it was better to submit something rather than miss the deadline completely.",2024-09-03 21:47:15
11652,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_3,Could you have sent a quick message at least? Maybe someone could have jumped on it.,2024-09-03 21:54:15
11653,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,"You're right. I should have communicated better. Next time, I'll make sure to check in, even if it's last minute.",2024-09-03 22:01:15
11654,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,"Thanks, it means a lot. Let's focus on fixing the errors now so we're ready for the presentation.",2024-09-03 22:05:15
11655,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's divide the tasks and get this done together.,2024-09-03 22:13:15
11656,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,"Sounds good. I'll fix the slides, and you guys can handle the script and timing.",2024-09-03 22:14:15
11657,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_1,Deal. We'll have everything polished before we present.,2024-09-03 22:15:15
11658,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_3,"Let’s make sure this is our best work yet. Thanks for understanding, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:25:15
11659,deescalatory_conversation_224,speaker_2,Thank you. Let's get to work and ace this presentation.,2024-09-03 22:28:15
11660,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,I can’t believe you went ahead and changed the presentation slides without telling me!,2024-09-03 21:23:19
11661,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_2,"I didn’t think it would be a big deal. The deadline is tomorrow, and I thought it needed to be more polished.",2024-09-03 21:24:19
11662,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,But we were supposed to work on it together. I’ve been prepping my parts based on the original slides.,2024-09-03 21:32:19
11663,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I thought a few tweaks would make it better. Can we review the changes and see if they work for both of us?",2024-09-03 21:42:19
11664,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,"Fine, let's go through them. But next time, please let me know before making changes.",2024-09-03 21:45:19
11665,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_2,Agreed. Here’s the first change I made. I updated the introduction to be more engaging. What do you think?,2024-09-03 21:47:19
11666,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,It does look better. But I think we should keep some of the original points too.,2024-09-03 21:50:19
11667,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_2,"That’s a good idea. Let’s incorporate both. Moving on to the next slide, I added more visuals to make it less text-heavy.",2024-09-03 21:57:19
11668,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,I see the improvement. Maybe we could add captions to the visuals for clarity?,2024-09-03 22:02:19
11669,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_2,"Absolutely, captions will help. I’ll start adding those. Anything else you noticed that we should change?",2024-09-03 22:09:19
11670,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_1,"On the conclusion slide, you removed my key takeaways. I think those are important.",2024-09-03 22:18:19
11671,deescalatory_conversation_225,speaker_2,You’re right; the key takeaways are crucial. Let,2024-09-03 22:24:19
11672,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,Why did you take my project idea without even asking me?,2024-09-03 21:29:22
11673,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,"I didn't think you'd mind. We always share our work, don’t we?",2024-09-03 21:34:22
11674,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,"But this was different. I had put weeks into that idea, and you just presented it as your own.",2024-09-03 21:35:22
11675,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,I see your point. I should've asked. Have you thought about how we can fix this?,2024-09-03 21:43:22
11676,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,"Honestly, just acknowledging what you did is a good start. Maybe we could collaborate on the next steps together?",2024-09-03 21:51:22
11677,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,That sounds fair. How about we present this project as a joint effort to the professor?,2024-09-03 21:56:22
11678,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,I’d appreciate that. Let's make sure to communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:02:22
11679,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll let the professor know about our decision. Anything else you’d like to discuss?,2024-09-03 22:08:22
11680,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_1,"No, that covers it. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:16:22
11681,deescalatory_conversation_226,speaker_2,Thank you for being open about it. Let's make this project even better together.,2024-09-03 22:24:22
11682,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:25:25
11683,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, sorry I couldn't make it, Lisa.",2024-09-03 21:26:25
11684,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_1,A heads-up would have been nice. We were left scrambling without you.,2024-09-03 21:31:25
11685,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_2,"I know, and I apologize. I thought I'd be able to let you know, but it all happened so fast.",2024-09-03 21:37:25
11686,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_3,It's not just about the meeting. You haven't been pulling your weight for weeks now.,2024-09-03 21:42:25
11687,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_2,"I can see why you feel that way, but I have been working on the research part from home. Maybe I should communicate better.",2024-09-03 21:47:25
11688,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_1,"That's good to hear, but we really need to see more collaboration. Group projects require us to work together.",2024-09-03 21:52:25
11689,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_2,Point taken. What specifically can I do this week to catch up and be more involved?,2024-09-03 22:00:25
11690,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_3,"For starters, you can help us finish the presentation slides. We really need your input on the statistical data.",2024-09-03 22:02:25
11691,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll prioritize that and get it done by tomorrow. Could you share the current draft with me?,2024-09-03 22:08:25
11692,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_1,"Yeah, I’ll email it to you right after this. Let’s all agree to keep each other updated more regularly from now on.",2024-09-03 22:10:25
11693,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's just move past this and focus on finishing strong.,2024-09-03 22:15:25
11694,deescalatory_conversation_227,speaker_2,"Thanks for understanding, guys. I'll make sure to keep the",2024-09-03 22:20:25
11695,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,"We need to talk about how you handled the team project, John.",2024-09-03 21:25:29
11696,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,"I don't see what the problem is, Lisa. I got my part done on time.",2024-09-03 21:34:29
11697,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,"Yes, but the way you did it really complicated things for the rest of us.",2024-09-03 21:43:29
11698,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,What do you mean? I followed the guidelines we discussed.,2024-09-03 21:44:29
11699,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,The guidelines weren't the issue. You added your own sections without discussing them with anyone first.,2024-09-03 21:49:29
11700,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,I thought they would add more depth to our project. What's wrong with that?,2024-09-03 21:53:29
11701,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,The problem is that it shifted our focus and made our final presentation confusing.,2024-09-03 21:56:29
11702,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,I didn't realize it would have that effect. Why didn't anyone say anything earlier?,2024-09-03 22:05:29
11703,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,"We tried, but you seemed set in your ways. We didn't know how to bring it up without causing tension.",2024-09-03 22:10:29
11704,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,I see. I didn't mean to make things difficult. I was just trying to contribute more.,2024-09-03 22:13:29
11705,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,"And we appreciate your effort. But moving forward, can we agree to discuss major changes together?",2024-09-03 22:19:29
11706,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_2,"Yes, I think that's fair. I'll make sure to run my ideas by everyone first from now on.",2024-09-03 22:20:29
11707,deescalatory_conversation_228,speaker_1,Great. Then let's move forward and make our next project even better.,2024-09-03 22:28:29
11708,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,We need to talk about the group project. I'm really concerned with how things are going.,2024-09-03 21:24:34
11709,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,What do you mean? I've been doing my part.,2024-09-03 21:29:34
11710,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,"I know you're working hard, but we keep missing deadlines and nobody seems to be on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:35:34
11711,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,Maybe we should have more regular check-ins? It feels like we're always racing to finish everything at the last minute.,2024-09-03 21:41:34
11712,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,That's a good idea. We need better coordination.,2024-09-03 21:47:34
11713,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,I agree. I didn't realize everyone felt this way. How about we set up a regular meeting schedule?,2024-09-03 21:50:34
11714,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,"Sounds good to me. Also, we could try dividing the tasks more evenly. Some of us have more work than others.",2024-09-03 21:53:34
11715,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,True. Let's make a clear list of tasks and who is responsible for each part.,2024-09-03 22:02:34
11716,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,"And if someone is struggling with their part, they need to ask for help sooner rather than later.",2024-09-03 22:05:34
11717,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,Absolutely. Communication is key. I'll start drafting an outline for our next meeting.,2024-09-03 22:06:34
11718,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,Great. We can review it together and make sure everyone's on board.,2024-09-03 22:09:34
11719,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_2,"Thanks, everyone. I think this will really help us move forward in a more organized way.",2024-09-03 22:13:34
11720,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's give it our best shot!,2024-09-03 22:17:34
11721,deescalatory_conversation_229,speaker_1,Looking forward to seeing our progress. Let's make this project something we can all be proud of.,2024-09-03 22:22:34
11722,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,"I can't believe you lost the client presentation file, Jamie!",2024-09-03 21:24:38
11723,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,"I didn't lose it, Sarah. I thought you had a backup.",2024-09-03 21:29:38
11724,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,I asked you to double-check. This was our biggest client!,2024-09-03 21:34:38
11725,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,And I complied. I even verified it was saved on the server.,2024-09-03 21:38:38
11726,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,Then what went wrong? This could cost us the contract.,2024-09-03 21:40:38
11727,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,Let's retrace our steps. Maybe there's a miscommunication we missed.,2024-09-03 21:48:38
11728,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,Fine. Did you upload it after making the final changes yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:58:38
11729,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,"Yes, I uploaded it right after our meeting. Did you confirm if the upload was successful?",2024-09-03 22:07:38
11730,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,"I noticed it was slow, but I thought it went through because no error messages popped up.",2024-09-03 22:08:38
11731,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,Maybe there's an issue with the server. Did you check if the file was listed on the server afterward?,2024-09-03 22:10:38
11732,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,"No, I didn't double-check. I assumed it was there. We should contact IT to see if there's a backup.",2024-09-03 22:17:38
11733,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,Good idea. Let's also inform the client about the situation and assure them that we're resolving it.,2024-09-03 22:26:38
11734,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,Agreed. I'll start drafting an email to the client. Can you get in touch with IT?,2024-09-03 22:36:38
11735,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_2,Already on it. I'll keep you updated once I hear from them.,2024-09-03 22:43:38
11736,deescalatory_conversation_230,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jamie. Let's make sure we have a more robust",2024-09-03 22:50:38
11737,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,I don't understand why you didn't pass me the ball when I was open in the last play.,2024-09-03 21:29:41
11738,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"I thought I had a better shot, I'm sorry if it seemed like I was ignoring you.",2024-09-03 21:33:41
11739,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,"It's not about ignoring, it's about making the right play for the team.",2024-09-03 21:37:41
11740,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_3,"We have to remember we're all here to win, not to outshine each other.",2024-09-03 21:46:41
11741,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have considered the team more. I'll be more aware next time.",2024-09-03 21:55:41
11742,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,"Thanks, and I'll make sure to call out when I'm open louder so there's no confusion.",2024-09-03 21:56:41
11743,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_3,Good plan. Let's keep our heads up and focus on the next game.,2024-09-03 22:01:41
11744,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's work on our communication during practice too.,2024-09-03 22:11:41
11745,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_1,"That sounds like a solid idea. We have the talent, we just need better coordination.",2024-09-03 22:17:41
11746,deescalatory_conversation_231,speaker_3,"Exactly. Together, we can turn this around.",2024-09-03 22:25:41
11747,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for the team project meeting, Tina?",2024-09-03 21:26:45
11748,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework yesterday, Sam.",2024-09-03 21:32:45
11749,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,"We all have homework, but we made a commitment to this project.",2024-09-03 21:35:45
11750,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,"Yeah, Tina, we really needed your input for the presentation part.",2024-09-03 21:41:45
11751,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,"I get that, Alex. I'm really sorry; I should've managed my time better.",2024-09-03 21:44:45
11752,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,We just want to make sure we're all on the same page. Can you help us finish the slides tonight?,2024-09-03 21:52:45
11753,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll clear my schedule for it. What time works for you guys?",2024-09-03 21:55:45
11754,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,How about 7 PM? That way we have enough time to finalize everything.,2024-09-03 21:58:45
11755,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,7 PM works for me. I'll make sure I'm prepared this time.,2024-09-03 22:01:45
11756,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,Great. Let's make tonight's session productive so we can nail this presentation.,2024-09-03 22:02:45
11757,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's put in the effort now so we don't scramble last minute.,2024-09-03 22:10:45
11758,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_2,"Thanks for understanding, guys. I'll see you at 7 PM then.",2024-09-03 22:12:45
11759,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_1,"See you then, Tina. Thanks for stepping up.",2024-09-03 22:18:45
11760,deescalatory_conversation_232,speaker_3,Looking forward to it. Let's do this!,2024-09-03 22:23:45
11761,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and changed the project presentation without even consulting me.,2024-09-03 21:23:47
11762,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal; I just swapped a few slides around.,2024-09-03 21:32:47
11763,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,It's a big deal to me. This is a group project. We need to be on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:33:47
11764,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,"Alright, I see your point. Can you tell me why you preferred the original order?",2024-09-03 21:36:47
11765,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,The original order had a logical flow from introduction to solution. Your changes made it confusing.,2024-09-03 21:46:47
11766,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,"Okay, I didn't realize that. Maybe we can sit down and review the order together?",2024-09-03 21:47:47
11767,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I appreciate you being open to discussing it.,2024-09-03 21:50:47
11768,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,Of course. I want us to do well. When do you have time to go over it?,2024-09-03 21:52:47
11769,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_1,How about right after our next class? We can find a quiet spot and work on it then.,2024-09-03 21:54:47
11770,deescalatory_conversation_233,speaker_2,Works for me. Let's make sure this presentation is the best it can be.,2024-09-03 21:58:47
11771,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,"Lisa, why didn't you tell me you failed the chemistry test? I had to hear it from your teacher.",2024-09-03 21:32:51
11772,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,"Mom, I was going to tell you, but I knew you'd be disappointed and angry.",2024-09-03 21:36:51
11773,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,"I'm more concerned that you felt you had to hide it from me. We need to be honest with each other, even if it's not good news.",2024-09-03 21:43:51
11774,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,"I know, but I've been trying so hard and still didn't do well. I didn't want to let you down.",2024-09-03 21:50:51
11775,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,"I understand you're trying, but keeping things from me doesn't help. How can we work on this together?",2024-09-03 21:53:51
11776,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,Maybe we can find a tutor or something. I need extra help.,2024-09-03 22:02:51
11777,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,That's a good idea. Let's look into tutoring options this weekend.,2024-09-03 22:05:51
11778,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,"Thanks, Mom. I'm really sorry for not telling you right away.",2024-09-03 22:11:51
11779,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_1,"I appreciate the apology. Let's keep each other in the loop, okay?",2024-09-03 22:12:51
11780,deescalatory_conversation_234,speaker_2,"Okay, I promise I will.",2024-09-03 22:22:51
11781,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,"Alex, I noticed you haven’t been participating much in the group project. Is everything okay?",2024-09-03 21:25:55
11782,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,"I’m fine, Sam, but I just don’t see the point. No one takes my suggestions seriously anyway.",2024-09-03 21:28:55
11783,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,I’m sorry you feel that way. Can you give me an example of when that happened?,2024-09-03 21:36:55
11784,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,Remember when I proposed using the survey method for data collection? Everyone just ignored it and went with interviews.,2024-09-03 21:38:55
11785,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,I see. Maybe that was overlooked in the discussion. Can we revisit your survey idea and see if it could still be useful?,2024-09-03 21:39:55
11786,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,It’s too late; we’re already deep into the interviews. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m not being heard.,2024-09-03 21:48:55
11787,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,I understand your frustration. Let’s make sure we incorporate your ideas moving forward. How about we set aside time in our next meeting to make sure everyone’s suggestions are discussed thoroughly?,2024-09-03 21:52:55
11788,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,That could work. I just want to make sure that my input is valued.,2024-09-03 22:01:55
11789,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,Absolutely. Your input is important to the success of our project. Let’s work together to ensure everyone’s voice is heard.,2024-09-03 22:04:55
11790,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_2,"Thanks, Sam. I’ll make an effort to participate more. Let’s make sure our next meeting is more inclusive.",2024-09-03 22:12:55
11791,deescalatory_conversation_235,speaker_1,"Sounds like a plan. I’ll bring it up with the team, and we’ll make sure to create",2024-09-03 22:20:55
11792,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,"You're always late for our band practice, Mike. It's starting to affect our performance.",2024-09-03 21:28:59
11793,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Lily. My schedule has been all over the place lately.",2024-09-03 21:34:59
11794,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,"I understand being busy, but can't you plan better? We're depending on you.",2024-09-03 21:43:59
11795,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,"I get that, but I also have work and school. It's not easy juggling everything.",2024-09-03 21:53:59
11796,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_3,Maybe we can come up with a new practice schedule that works for everyone?,2024-09-03 21:55:59
11797,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,"That could help, but only if everyone sticks to it. Consistency is important.",2024-09-03 22:04:59
11798,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,Agreed. What if we move practice to weekends? Would that work better?,2024-09-03 22:09:59
11799,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_3,"Weekends are usually more open for me. How about you, Lily?",2024-09-03 22:14:59
11800,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,"Weekends sound better. If that can help Mike be more consistent, I'm all for trying it.",2024-09-03 22:22:59
11801,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,"Thanks, Lily. I appreciate your understanding. I'll do my best to be more reliable.",2024-09-03 22:32:59
11802,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_3,Great! Let's set a specific time and see how it goes from there.,2024-09-03 22:35:59
11803,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_1,"Sounds good. Let's plan for Saturday afternoons, then. Deal?",2024-09-03 22:41:59
11804,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_2,"Deal. Thanks for being flexible, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:47:59
11805,deescalatory_conversation_236,speaker_3,Looking forward to our next practice. We'll make it work.,2024-09-03 22:49:59
11806,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,"Why did you cancel our band's practice session again, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:33:02
11807,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Mia. I had to stay late at work unexpectedly.",2024-09-03 21:36:02
11808,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,You could have at least sent a message to let us know.,2024-09-03 21:37:02
11809,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. It won't happen again.,2024-09-03 21:38:02
11810,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,"It's not just about this one time, though. This is the third time this month.",2024-09-03 21:44:02
11811,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,I understand your frustration. I've been really overwhelmed with my new job responsibilities.,2024-09-03 21:45:02
11812,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,"We're all busy, but we make time for the band because it's important to us.",2024-09-03 21:49:02
11813,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"Yes, and it's important to me too. I think I need to manage my time better.",2024-09-03 21:56:02
11814,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,Can we agree on setting a more flexible schedule? Maybe that will accommodate everyone's commitments.,2024-09-03 22:01:02
11815,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. How about we discuss the new schedule with the rest of the band?,2024-09-03 22:03:02
11816,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,Perfect. Let's bring it up in our group chat and see when everyone is available.,2024-09-03 22:10:02
11817,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,I'll make sure to be more proactive in communicating from now on.,2024-09-03 22:16:02
11818,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it. I just want us all to be on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:18:02
11819,deescalatory_conversation_237,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Mia. We're a team, and we need to work together on this.",2024-09-03 22:27:02
11820,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,You always leave your dishes in the sink! How many times do I have to tell you to clean up after yourself?,2024-09-03 21:32:05
11821,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,"I know, I know. I'm sorry, but I had a really long day at work and just didn't have the energy.",2024-09-03 21:42:05
11822,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"We all have long days, but that doesn't mean I should do all the cleaning.",2024-09-03 21:47:05
11823,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,You're right. It’s not fair that you end up taking care of everything. I'll try to do better.,2024-09-03 21:53:05
11824,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, but I need you to actually follow through. Promises only go so far.",2024-09-03 21:54:05
11825,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,I get it. How about we set up a schedule so we can share the chores more evenly?,2024-09-03 22:02:05
11826,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"That could work. Maybe if we write it down, it'll help us both remember.",2024-09-03 22:03:05
11827,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's sit down later and figure out a system that works for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:11:05
11828,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_1,"Okay, that sounds fair. I didn’t mean to snap, I just felt overwhelmed.",2024-09-03 22:13:05
11829,deescalatory_conversation_238,speaker_2,"No worries, I understand. We'll get through this together.",2024-09-03 22:23:05
11830,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,"Look, Jenna, you can't keep showing up late to our group meetings. It's affecting all of us.",2024-09-03 21:32:09
11831,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Alex. It's just that I have a lot going on with work and my classes.",2024-09-03 21:36:09
11832,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,"We all have busy schedules, Jenna, but this project is really important for our grade.",2024-09-03 21:40:09
11833,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_3,Maybe we can figure out a new time that works better for everyone?,2024-09-03 21:48:09
11834,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_2,"I'd really appreciate that, Sam. Mornings are especially tough for me because of my night job.",2024-09-03 21:54:09
11835,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,I can understand that. What if we meet in the afternoons instead?,2024-09-03 22:04:09
11836,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_2,"Afternoons are definitely better for me. Thanks, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:14:09
11837,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_3,"Alright, how about we move our meetings to 3 PM? Does that work for everyone?",2024-09-03 22:24:09
11838,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,I'm okay with that. It's a fair compromise.,2024-09-03 22:30:09
11839,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_2,"3 PM works perfectly. I really want to contribute more, just need a better time.",2024-09-03 22:39:09
11840,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_1,Glad we could resolve this. Let's focus on nailing this project now.,2024-09-03 22:49:09
11841,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's put this behind us and do our best.,2024-09-03 22:54:09
11842,deescalatory_conversation_239,speaker_2,"Thanks, everyone, for being understanding. I'll be there on time from now on.",2024-09-03 22:56:09
11843,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Tom? We could have scored in the last minute!",2024-09-03 21:30:12
11844,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,"I thought you were too far from the goal, Emily. I didn't see a clear opportunity.",2024-09-03 21:31:12
11845,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,I was wide open! You should've trusted me.,2024-09-03 21:37:12
11846,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I was trying to make the best decision under pressure. Maybe I misjudged the situation.,2024-09-03 21:40:12
11847,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,"It's not just this game, Tom. It feels like you never trust my position on the field.",2024-09-03 21:45:12
11848,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,"That's not true, Emily. I do trust you. Remember last game? I passed to you multiple times and you scored.",2024-09-03 21:55:12
11849,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,"Okay, but we need to work on our communication. We can't let moments like this cost us the match.",2024-09-03 22:02:12
11850,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,"Absolutely. How about this – next practice, we focus on signaling and positioning? We can run through some drills to improve our teamwork.",2024-09-03 22:04:12
11851,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,That sounds like a good plan. I don't want us to keep missing these chances.,2024-09-03 22:06:12
11852,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,Me neither. Let's make sure we talk more during the game too. Clear communication can make a big difference.,2024-09-03 22:11:12
11853,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's turn this around and make our team stronger.,2024-09-03 22:18:12
11854,deescalatory_conversation_240,speaker_2,Definitely. We're in this together. Let's make it count next match.,2024-09-03 22:27:12
11855,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,"Why did you change the project theme without telling me, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:30:15
11856,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_2,"I didn’t think you were that invested in it, Maria. I thought we might need something more unique.",2024-09-03 21:34:15
11857,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,But we agreed on the theme together. Changing it without discussing feels like you don’t respect my input.,2024-09-03 21:37:15
11858,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_2,I’m sorry. I should have consulted you first. I was just worried we weren’t standing out.,2024-09-03 21:47:15
11859,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,It’s not just about standing out; it’s about teamwork and communication. Can we at least discuss these changes before implementing them?,2024-09-03 21:48:15
11860,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let’s set a meeting after class to go over any major changes together. Will that work?",2024-09-03 21:51:15
11861,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_1,"Yes, that sounds fair. Let’s make sure we’re on the same page from now on.",2024-09-03 21:52:15
11862,deescalatory_conversation_241,speaker_2,Agreed. We’ll handle this project as a team. Thanks for bringing this up.,2024-09-03 21:58:15
11863,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the deadline change for the project? Now I look unprepared in front of the whole team.,2024-09-03 21:33:18
11864,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,I assumed you saw the update email. It was sent to everyone.,2024-09-03 21:34:18
11865,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,"Well, I didn't see it. You know I rely on you for these things.",2024-09-03 21:41:18
11866,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I should've double-checked with you. What can we do now to fix this?,2024-09-03 21:42:18
11867,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,We need to inform the team and adjust our strategy. Can you help me with the presentation updates?,2024-09-03 21:46:18
11868,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's prioritize the key points we need to address and then work through the details together.,2024-09-03 21:50:18
11869,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,"Alright. Also, can we set up a system to make sure this doesn’t happen again?",2024-09-03 21:55:18
11870,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,Definitely. Maybe we can schedule a weekly check-in specifically for deadline and update reviews.,2024-09-03 22:02:18
11871,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,That sounds like a good plan. Thanks for understanding and helping out.,2024-09-03 22:04:18
11872,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,No problem. Let's move forward and get this project back on track.,2024-09-03 22:12:18
11873,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's get started on the presentation updates now.,2024-09-03 22:18:18
11874,deescalatory_conversation_242,speaker_2,I'm on it. Let's divide the sections and tackle them one by one.,2024-09-03 22:20:18
11875,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,Why did you delete my scene from the script without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:29:22
11876,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was fitting with the tone we decided on, and we were running out of time before the rehearsal.",2024-09-03 21:38:22
11877,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,But it was crucial to my character's development! You can't just change things unilaterally.,2024-09-03 21:47:22
11878,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,I can see why you're upset. Maybe we could discuss how to reintegrate some of those elements in a different way?,2024-09-03 21:54:22
11879,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,I don't know if that's the solution. This feels like a pattern—my ideas keep getting sidelined.,2024-09-03 21:56:22
11880,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,I didn't realize it seemed that way. Let's look at the script together and see how we can make sure your contributions are reflected.,2024-09-03 21:58:22
11881,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,"Alright, but we need to make sure this doesn't happen again. We need to communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:05:22
11882,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's set up a meeting before making any major changes in the future.,2024-09-03 22:13:22
11883,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I'll make notes about the scenes and we can discuss them tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:14:22
11884,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,"Perfect, and I'll come up with suggestions to keep the tone consistent. Let's work on this together.",2024-09-03 22:16:22
11885,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_1,"Okay, I feel a bit better about this. Thanks for being willing to talk it through.",2024-09-03 22:17:22
11886,deescalatory_conversation_243,speaker_2,Thank you for bringing it up. I'm glad we cleared the air.,2024-09-03 22:26:22
11887,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up to the group meeting again, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:31:26
11888,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,"Sorry, Amy. I had a lot of personal stuff going on. I didn't mean to miss it.",2024-09-03 21:32:26
11889,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_1,We've all got personal stuff. We were counting on you to finish your part of the project.,2024-09-03 21:40:26
11890,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,"I understand, but it's hard to juggle everything right now. Can we work out a way to catch up?",2024-09-03 21:45:26
11891,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_1,It's not just about catching up. It's about being reliable. What can you do to ensure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 21:55:26
11892,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,I'll set reminders and make sure I don't take on too many tasks at once. Can we maybe split up parts differently if someone's overwhelmed?,2024-09-03 22:05:26
11893,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Let's redistribute some tasks so everyone's workload is manageable. Would you be okay with taking on some of the less time-sensitive sections?,2024-09-03 22:13:26
11894,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,"Yes, I'm okay with that. I'll take those parts and make sure they're done on time. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:21:26
11895,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_1,"Good. Let's check in more frequently, too, so we can support each other better. Agreed?",2024-09-03 22:24:26
11896,deescalatory_conversation_244,speaker_2,Agreed. Weekly check-ins sound good. Let's make sure we all stay on track.,2024-09-03 22:30:26
11897,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_1,"Why haven't you been showing up to any of our group meetings, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:31:30
11898,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,"I've had a lot going on, but I'm still planning to contribute.",2024-09-03 21:36:30
11899,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_3,It's just that it's starting to feel unfair. We all have busy schedules but we make the time.,2024-09-03 21:46:30
11900,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,"I get that, but I've been swamped with work and family stuff. I'll catch up, I promise.",2024-09-03 21:56:30
11901,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_1,We need you to be more specific. What parts of the project are you planning to handle?,2024-09-03 22:01:30
11902,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,I can work on the research section. I just need another day or two to sort out my personal stuff.,2024-09-03 22:09:30
11903,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_3,Communication would help too. We've been in the dark about your availability.,2024-09-03 22:16:30
11904,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,You're right. I should've let you know. I'll do better at keeping you updated.,2024-09-03 22:21:30
11905,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_1,"It would really help. We’re all feeling the pressure here, and not knowing what’s going on just adds to it.",2024-09-03 22:22:30
11906,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,"I understand. From now on, I'll make sure to keep you posted on my progress and any issues that come up.",2024-09-03 22:28:30
11907,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_3,"We appreciate it. Also, if you need help with anything, just let us know. We’re a team.",2024-09-03 22:29:30
11908,deescalatory_conversation_245,speaker_2,Thanks,2024-09-03 22:33:30
11909,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking?,2024-09-03 21:26:32
11910,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,I didn’t know it was such a big deal. It’s just cake.,2024-09-03 21:28:32
11911,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,"It’s not just about the cake, it’s about considering others.",2024-09-03 21:35:32
11912,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,"Okay, but no one said they wanted it. It was just sitting there.",2024-09-03 21:36:32
11913,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,We could have shared it or at least talked about it.,2024-09-03 21:43:32
11914,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,I guess I didn’t think about it like that. I’m sorry.,2024-09-03 21:45:32
11915,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,"Thanks for understanding. Next time, can we just check with each other first?",2024-09-03 21:53:32
11916,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I’ll make sure to do that next time.",2024-09-03 21:54:32
11917,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_1,"Great, it means a lot. Let's just move past this.",2024-09-03 22:03:32
11918,deescalatory_conversation_246,speaker_2,"Agreed, let’s focus on enjoying our time together.",2024-09-03 22:11:32
11919,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you pass me the ball during the match, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:31:36
11920,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,"I didn’t see you open, Jake. You were behind the defender most of the time.",2024-09-03 21:32:36
11921,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,"I was wide open several times, and you still ignored me!",2024-09-03 21:41:36
11922,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,I wasn’t sure if I could make the pass without it getting intercepted. It was a tough call.,2024-09-03 21:45:36
11923,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,It felt like you didn’t trust my abilities out there.,2024-09-03 21:47:36
11924,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,It’s not about trust. I was just trying to make the safest play for the team.,2024-09-03 21:53:36
11925,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,"We lost because we didn’t utilize all our options, including me.",2024-09-03 21:59:36
11926,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,I understand that. Maybe we need to work on our communication during the game.,2024-09-03 22:00:36
11927,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,"Yeah, maybe calling out for the pass more clearly might help.",2024-09-03 22:02:36
11928,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,"Agreed. Also, I can be more aware of your position and look for those opportunities.",2024-09-03 22:03:36
11929,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,"So, we’re good?",2024-09-03 22:12:36
11930,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_2,We’re good. Let’s learn from this and be better next time.,2024-09-03 22:21:36
11931,deescalatory_conversation_247,speaker_1,Definitely. Let’s go win the next one.,2024-09-03 22:23:36
11932,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the deadline for the group project being moved up?,2024-09-03 21:26:39
11933,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,I didn't know until last night myself. I was going to tell you this morning.,2024-09-03 21:32:39
11934,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,But now we hardly have any time left to finish it!,2024-09-03 21:38:39
11935,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,"I know, it's frustrating. We should focus on what we can get done now.",2024-09-03 21:47:39
11936,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_3,Can we split the remaining tasks between us?,2024-09-03 21:56:39
11937,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,That's a good idea. We can divide the workload more effectively that way.,2024-09-03 21:58:39
11938,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,I can handle the research part and put it into the presentation slides.,2024-09-03 22:05:39
11939,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_3,I'll take care of writing the summary and proofreading everything.,2024-09-03 22:09:39
11940,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,"Okay, I'll compile the data analysis section and format the document.",2024-09-03 22:11:39
11941,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,"Great, we just need to stay in touch and update each other on our progress.",2024-09-03 22:20:39
11942,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_3,Let's set a check-in time later today to make sure everything is on track.,2024-09-03 22:30:39
11943,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks, everyone. We'll get this done together.",2024-09-03 22:38:39
11944,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_2,"Yes, we can do this. Let's make the best of the time we have left.",2024-09-03 22:48:39
11945,deescalatory_conversation_248,speaker_3,Perfect. Let's get to work then!,2024-09-03 22:56:39
11946,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up for the group project meeting yesterday.,2024-09-03 21:27:43
11947,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I had an emergency come up at the last minute. I tried to text you.",2024-09-03 21:35:43
11948,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,"We all have emergencies, but you could have left some work for us to review or something.",2024-09-03 21:40:43
11949,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have communicated better. How can I make it up to the group?",2024-09-03 21:43:43
11950,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,We need you to focus on the data analysis part. Can you handle that by tomorrow?,2024-09-03 21:52:43
11951,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll prioritize it and make sure it's done by tomorrow. Anything specific you need from me?",2024-09-03 21:57:43
11952,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,Just make sure it's detailed and that you highlight any trends you see. We need that for the presentation.,2024-09-03 22:06:43
11953,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,"Got it. Thanks for understanding, and I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:16:43
11954,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_1,I appreciate it. Let's get this done so we can relax afterward.,2024-09-03 22:19:43
11955,deescalatory_conversation_249,speaker_2,Deal. I'll check in with you tonight to update you on my progress.,2024-09-03 22:21:43
11956,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were going to change the project format at the last minute?,2024-09-03 21:31:46
11957,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,I thought it would be a good idea to switch things up for a better presentation. I didn't think it was a big deal.,2024-09-03 21:41:46
11958,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,It is a big deal. We've been working on the original format for weeks. Now we might miss the deadline!,2024-09-03 21:42:46
11959,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I just wanted to make our project stand out. How can we make this work without losing too much time?",2024-09-03 21:52:46
11960,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,"Maybe we can divide the new tasks. I'll handle the data reorganization, and you focus on the new design elements.",2024-09-03 21:56:46
11961,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'll start working on the new design right now. Let's meet tomorrow to review our progress.,2024-09-03 21:57:46
11962,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,Good idea. Let's make sure to communicate better so we're both on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:59:46
11963,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for understanding. We’ll get this done together.,2024-09-03 22:07:46
11964,deescalatory_conversation_250,speaker_1,"Alright, let's get back to work. We can do this.",2024-09-03 22:12:46
11965,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,"I saw you went ahead and submitted the group project without telling anyone, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:32:50
11966,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,"Yeah, because no one else was taking the initiative, John.",2024-09-03 21:33:50
11967,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,We were all waiting for a final review meeting. It was decided last class.,2024-09-03 21:35:50
11968,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_3,"I agree, Sarah. We could've caught any mistakes together before the final submission.",2024-09-03 21:45:50
11969,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,"I understand that, but every time I tried to schedule something, no one responded.",2024-09-03 21:54:50
11970,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,Maybe we should've communicated better. But submitting without informing us still feels wrong.,2024-09-03 22:04:50
11971,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,I did leave a message in the group chat. Did you see it?,2024-09-03 22:10:50
11972,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_3,"I saw it, but it was only a few hours before you submitted the project. Not everyone had time to respond.",2024-09-03 22:11:50
11973,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,Exactly. We all have different schedules. A bit more notice would’ve helped.,2024-09-03 22:21:50
11974,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,I get that. I should’ve given more notice. I just thought it was better to submit than risk losing points for being late.,2024-09-03 22:30:50
11975,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_3,"Losing points would've been bad, but working as a team is important too.",2024-09-03 22:31:50
11976,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,"How about next time, we set clearer deadlines for everyone to give feedback?",2024-09-03 22:37:50
11977,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's make sure our communications are more timely and everyone’s aware.,2024-09-03 22:41:50
11978,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_3,Sounds good. We can use a shared calendar to keep track of deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:46:50
11979,deescalatory_conversation_251,speaker_1,Let's,2024-09-03 22:49:50

11981,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,"I know, Rachel. I'm really sorry, but I had an emergency at home.",2024-09-03 21:30:54
11982,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,An emergency? You could've at least informed us. We were left scrambling!,2024-09-03 21:38:54
11983,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,"You're right, I should've contacted you. But honestly, it happened so fast, I didn't have time to think.",2024-09-03 21:47:54
11984,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_3,"Guys, let's just try to figure out what to do next. We can't change what happened.",2024-09-03 21:54:54
11985,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,"I understand emergencies happen, but it feels like you don't care about our work.",2024-09-03 22:03:54
11986,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,"I do care, Rachel. This project is important to me too. Maybe we can convince the teacher to let us present again?",2024-09-03 22:13:54
11987,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_3,That's a good idea. What if we go to Mrs. Johnson and explain the situation?,2024-09-03 22:15:54
11988,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,We can try that. But we need to be prepared and make sure we deliver a perfect presentation this time.,2024-09-03 22:21:54
11989,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,I'm ready to put in extra hours to make it right.,2024-09-03 22:28:54
11990,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_3,Let's work together and nail this. We can meet after school today and review everything.,2024-09-03 22:34:54
11991,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_1,"Okay. Ethan, just make sure you communicate with us from now on, alright?",2024-09-03 22:40:54
11992,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_2,"I will. Thanks for giving me another chance, Rachel.",2024-09-03 22:48:54
11993,deescalatory_conversation_252,speaker_3,"Alright, then let's get to work and make this the",2024-09-03 22:56:54
11994,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,"I can't believe you missed another deadline, Jordan. This is getting ridiculous.",2024-09-03 21:26:57
11995,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I know I've been late, but I've got a lot going on right now.",2024-09-03 21:30:57
11996,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,"We all have a lot going on, Jordan. That's no excuse to keep dropping the ball.",2024-09-03 21:36:57
11997,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_3,"Guys, let's try to figure out a solution rather than pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 21:42:57
11998,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"I get it, I messed up. How can I make it right at this point?",2024-09-03 21:44:57
11999,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,We need you to actually start contributing and not just showing up last minute.,2024-09-03 21:47:57
12000,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_3,Maybe we can redistribute some of the work so that it's more manageable for everyone?,2024-09-03 21:56:57
12001,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,"That could help, but only if everyone follows through this time.",2024-09-03 22:01:57
12002,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,I'm willing to take on more work if it helps. What needs to be done?,2024-09-03 22:08:57
12003,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_3,We need someone to finish the research section and proofread the introduction.,2024-09-03 22:12:57
12004,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,"Okay, I'll handle the research section and start on the proofreading.",2024-09-03 22:15:57
12005,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_1,"Fine, but let's set new deadlines and actually stick to them.",2024-09-03 22:21:57
12006,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's have everything done by this Friday so we can review together before the final submission.,2024-09-03 22:23:57
12007,deescalatory_conversation_253,speaker_2,That works for me. Thanks for giving me another,2024-09-03 22:30:57
12008,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,Why did you change the group project topic without consulting any of us?,2024-09-03 21:30:02
12009,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,Because the original topic wasn’t working out. We were getting nowhere.,2024-09-03 21:36:02
12010,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,But we should have discussed it together. We’re supposed to make decisions as a team.,2024-09-03 21:41:02
12011,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_3,"I agree. We all have a stake in this project, and changing the topic affects everyone.",2024-09-03 21:45:02
12012,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,"I understand that, but we were falling behind, and I thought a new topic could help us catch up.",2024-09-03 21:50:02
12013,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,"Still, making decisions without talking to the group creates confusion and tension.",2024-09-03 21:52:02
12014,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,You're right. I should have asked for everyone's opinion before making the change.,2024-09-03 21:54:02
12015,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_3,"And maybe if you had explained your reasons, we could have seen your point and agreed on it.",2024-09-03 22:02:02
12016,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,"Exactly. Communication is key, especially in a group project.",2024-09-03 22:04:02
12017,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,I’m sorry for assuming and making changes on my own. I'll make sure to involve everyone next time.,2024-09-03 22:08:02
12018,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's focus on the new topic now and ensure we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:16:02
12019,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_3,"Agreed. If we just communicate more openly, we can avoid issues like this in the future.",2024-09-03 22:21:02
12020,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’ll share all the updates and we can plan our next steps together.,2024-09-03 22:27:02
12021,deescalatory_conversation_254,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let's make sure this project is a success for all of us.,2024-09-03 22:37:02
12022,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,"I can't believe you told Mr. Anderson about me copying your homework, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:30:06
12023,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"Jake, you know I had to. It's against the school's honor code, and I didn't want to get in trouble for something you did.",2024-09-03 21:37:06
12024,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,But now I'm in detention for a week! You could have just warned me or something.,2024-09-03 21:44:06
12025,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but you put me in a tough spot. What did you expect me to do?",2024-09-03 21:46:06
12026,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,"I don't know, maybe talk to me first? I thought we were friends.",2024-09-03 21:47:06
12027,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"We are friends, Jake. That's why this is so hard. But you have to see it from my perspective. I didn't want to risk my own academic standing.",2024-09-03 21:48:06
12028,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,It's just one homework assignment. Was it really worth it?,2024-09-03 21:49:06
12029,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,It's not just about the assignment. It's about the principle. We could have worked on the homework together if you were struggling.,2024-09-03 21:56:06
12030,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,Maybe you're right. I just felt so overwhelmed and didn't know what else to do.,2024-09-03 22:01:06
12031,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"Next time, just ask for help. I'd rather spend extra time explaining things to you than see you get into more trouble.",2024-09-03 22:09:06
12032,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_1,"I understand now. I'm sorry for putting you in that position, and I'll try to make better choices.",2024-09-03 22:10:06
12033,deescalatory_conversation_255,speaker_2,"Apology accepted, Jake. And let's promise to communicate better from now on.",2024-09-03 22:17:06
12034,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me about the changes to the group project, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:27:09
12035,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"I tried to, Alex. You weren't paying attention in the meeting.",2024-09-03 21:28:09
12036,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,"I was paying attention, but you should have made it clearer. Now we're behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:30:09
12037,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_3,"Look, both of you are right to some extent. Can we just focus on fixing it?",2024-09-03 21:37:09
12038,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"Okay, I'm sorry if it wasn't clear enough, Alex. How about we divide the tasks again so we can catch up?",2024-09-03 21:47:09
12039,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,"Fine, let's do that. But we need to make sure everyone stays in the loop this time.",2024-09-03 21:51:09
12040,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's use a shared document or a group chat to keep track of any changes.,2024-09-03 22:00:09
12041,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_4,That sounds good. I'm ready to take on more tasks if it helps get us back on track.,2024-09-03 22:06:09
12042,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_2,"I'll update the shared document with all the recent changes. Everyone, please check it tonight.",2024-09-03 22:07:09
12043,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_1,"Alright, I'll do that. Thanks for being willing to sort this out, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:14:09
12044,deescalatory_conversation_256,speaker_3,No problem. Let's make this project a success together.,2024-09-03 22:21:09
12045,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,"Why did you eat my lunch from the fridge, Lisa?",2024-09-03 21:33:13
12046,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,"I didn't know it was yours, Mike. There were no labels on any of the food.",2024-09-03 21:42:13
12047,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,"Come on, Lisa, everyone knows I bring that specific salad to work every day.",2024-09-03 21:49:13
12048,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,I wasn't trying to upset you. I was in a hurry and didn't think. I'm sorry.,2024-09-03 21:51:13
12049,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,"It's just frustrating because I look forward to that lunch, and now I have nothing to eat.",2024-09-03 21:57:13
12050,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,"I understand, and I really am sorry. How about I buy you lunch to make up for it?",2024-09-03 22:05:13
12051,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,"That would be nice, but I also think we need a better system for labeling our food.",2024-09-03 22:08:13
12052,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,Agreed. How about we set up a designated spot in the fridge for each person and clearly label our containers?,2024-09-03 22:09:13
12053,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Maybe we can also send out an office-wide email to remind everyone about respecting each other's stuff.,2024-09-03 22:17:13
12054,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,I'll write up the email if you set up the labeled spots in the fridge.,2024-09-03 22:24:13
12055,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_1,Deal. Thanks for understanding and offering to help.,2024-09-03 22:29:13
12056,deescalatory_conversation_257,speaker_2,No problem. Let's make sure this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:37:13
12057,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,Why did you change the code without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:30:15
12058,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,I thought it would make the program run faster.,2024-09-03 21:36:15
12059,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,But now nothing works! Did you even test it?,2024-09-03 21:44:15
12060,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"I ran a few tests, but I guess I missed some cases.",2024-09-03 21:48:15
12061,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,You should have coordinated with me. We’re a team.,2024-09-03 21:55:15
12062,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,You’re right. I should have discussed it with you first. Can we work on fixing it together?,2024-09-03 22:05:15
12063,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,"Okay, let's review what you changed and find the issue.",2024-09-03 22:10:15
12064,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"Sure, I added some optimizations to the sorting algorithm. Want me to walk you through it?",2024-09-03 22:16:15
12065,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,"Yes, please. We need to make sure all scenarios are covered.",2024-09-03 22:26:15
12066,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,I agree. Maybe we can run some additional tests this time.,2024-09-03 22:29:15
12067,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,Good idea. Let's start with the test cases we already have and then add more complex ones.,2024-09-03 22:30:15
12068,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,"Alright, I'll document the changes and the test results as we go.",2024-09-03 22:35:15
12069,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_1,Excellent. Thanks for being open to fixing this together.,2024-09-03 22:40:15
12070,deescalatory_conversation_258,speaker_2,No problem. We’ll get it sorted and make the program better.,2024-09-03 22:41:15
12071,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the presentation, Mike. We needed you there.",2024-09-03 21:31:19
12072,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,"I had an emergency come up, Sarah. It wasn’t something I could avoid.",2024-09-03 21:41:19
12073,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,You should have told us! We were left scrambling at the last minute.,2024-09-03 21:50:19
12074,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,"I get that, and I’m really sorry. But how could I have contacted you in the middle of everything?",2024-09-03 21:54:19
12075,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,A quick text would have been enough. We were all stressed out because we didn't know where you were.,2024-09-03 22:02:19
12076,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. Next time I’ll make sure to at least send a message.",2024-09-03 22:03:19
12077,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,"Thank you. We’re a team, and we count on each other. We just want to know we can rely on you.",2024-09-03 22:12:19
12078,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,"I understand, and I appreciate that you’re bringing this up directly.",2024-09-03 22:19:19
12079,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,"Can we figure out a plan for emergencies like this? That way, we know what to do.",2024-09-03 22:20:19
12080,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. Maybe setting up a group chat or a communication chain for emergencies could help.,2024-09-03 22:27:19
12081,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's bring this up in the next team meeting and make a plan.,2024-09-03 22:31:19
12082,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,Definitely. I'll apologize to the team and suggest we create that emergency protocol.,2024-09-03 22:39:19
12083,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_1,"Thanks, Mike. We just want to prevent this from happening again.",2024-09-03 22:44:19
12084,deescalatory_conversation_259,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:50:19
12085,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,"I can't believe you told Coach about my injury, Sarah. Now I can't play in the game tomorrow!",2024-09-03 21:28:23
12086,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,"John, I was just worried about you. That sprain looked serious, and I didn't want you getting hurt even worse.",2024-09-03 21:31:23
12087,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,"But I was fine! I could have handled it, and now we're down a player because of you.",2024-09-03 21:40:23
12088,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,We can't afford to lose you for the entire season. Missing one game is better than missing ten.,2024-09-03 21:44:23
12089,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,You could have at least talked to me first instead of going behind my back.,2024-09-03 21:50:23
12090,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have. But I didn't want the pressure of the game making you hide how bad it really was.",2024-09-03 22:00:23
12091,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,"Fine, I get that. But now what? We need to convince Coach to let me play.",2024-09-03 22:02:23
12092,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,How about we talk to Coach together? We explain our side and see if we can find a compromise.,2024-09-03 22:09:23
12093,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,"Alright, but I'm not promising anything. Just... let me do the talking.",2024-09-03 22:16:23
12094,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,Deal. We'll approach Coach and see if there's a way for you to still be part of the game safely.,2024-09-03 22:19:23
12095,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_1,"Okay, let's do this. And Sarah, thanks for looking out for me. Just... next time, talk to me first.",2024-09-03 22:29:23
12096,deescalatory_conversation_260,speaker_2,"I will, John. Promise.",2024-09-03 22:31:23
12097,deescalatory_conversation_261,**Scenario,Group of friends planning a trip**,2024-09-03 21:25:27
12098,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,I can't believe you booked the hotel without asking us first.,2024-09-03 21:27:27
12099,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Well, someone had to take charge. We were getting nowhere.",2024-09-03 21:37:27
12100,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,But now we're stuck. I don't like the location you chose.,2024-09-03 21:38:27
12101,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_4,"Look, I just wanted us to have a fun trip, and I got a great deal. Can we discuss how to make it work?",2024-09-03 21:44:27
12102,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,What if we look for another hotel nearby that's more convenient for everyone?,2024-09-03 21:52:27
12103,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Fine, but we need to act fast. Availability is dropping quickly.",2024-09-03 21:59:27
12104,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,"How about speaker_2 shares the details, and then we can all search for alternatives?",2024-09-03 22:01:27
12105,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_4,That sounds fair. Let's make a list of possible hotels and vote on the best one.,2024-09-03 22:08:27
12106,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,I appreciate you being open to change. I'll start looking right now.,2024-09-03 22:17:27
12107,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Thanks, speaker_1. I'll share the details in our group chat.",2024-09-03 22:21:27
12108,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,I'll compare prices and reviews for us. Let's make sure everyone is happy with the choice.,2024-09-03 22:30:27
12109,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_4,"Agreed. We're in this together, guys. Let's make sure our trip is awesome.",2024-09-03 22:35:27
12110,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_1,"Thanks, everyone. This is already feeling better.",2024-09-03 22:39:27
12111,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_2,"Yeah, working together is definitely the way to go.",2024-09-03 22:49:27
12112,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_3,Let's finalize this tonight so we can move forward.,2024-09-03 22:53:27
12113,deescalatory_conversation_261,speaker_4,,2024-09-03 22:54:27
12114,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you pass the ball to me in the last few minutes of the game?",2024-09-03 21:25:30
12115,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,I thought I had a clearer shot. We were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:35:30
12116,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,But I was in a better position. You've got to trust your teammates.,2024-09-03 21:38:30
12117,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,"I get that, but in the heat of the moment, I felt I had to take the shot.",2024-09-03 21:48:30
12118,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_3,Can we just focus on what we can improve as a team? No one's perfect.,2024-09-03 21:51:30
12119,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,"Fine, but it still feels like my efforts are being overlooked.",2024-09-03 21:59:30
12120,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,That's not my intention at all. I'm sorry if it felt that way. Let's talk through what went wrong.,2024-09-03 22:05:30
12121,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_3,Maybe we should discuss how to communicate better on the court during pressure situations.,2024-09-03 22:06:30
12122,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,"Yeah, I think clearer signals and trust are key.",2024-09-03 22:07:30
12123,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,"Agreed. I’ll work on that, and we can all do a better job of supporting each other.",2024-09-03 22:11:30
12124,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_3,How about we practice some situational drills next time to improve our decision-making?,2024-09-03 22:16:30
12125,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_1,That sounds good. And let's make sure we're vocal about what we need from each other.,2024-09-03 22:22:30
12126,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for talking this out.,2024-09-03 22:23:30
12127,deescalatory_conversation_262,speaker_3,We’ve got this. Let’s bounce back stronger in the next game.,2024-09-03 22:32:30
12128,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"Jake, why didn't you tell me you changed the project deadline?",2024-09-03 21:27:33
12129,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,"I did tell you, Sarah. I sent an email last week.",2024-09-03 21:30:33
12130,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,I didn’t receive any email. Why didn’t you confirm with me directly?,2024-09-03 21:33:33
12131,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,I assumed everyone read the email. I didn't think I needed to.,2024-09-03 21:42:33
12132,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"Well, now I'm behind and it’ll affect our group presentation. What do we do now?",2024-09-03 21:48:33
12133,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,Maybe we can ask for an extension together. It would show we’re both committed.,2024-09-03 21:54:33
12134,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"An extension could work, but will the others agree? They might be frustrated too.",2024-09-03 22:02:33
12135,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,We should discuss it in our next team meeting. It’s better to be transparent about it.,2024-09-03 22:07:33
12136,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"Okay, let’s do that. And next time, please make sure critical changes are communicated more directly.",2024-09-03 22:11:33
12137,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_2,"I will, Sarah. Let's make sure this doesn’t happen again and focus on fixing this now.",2024-09-03 22:12:33
12138,deescalatory_conversation_263,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks for understanding, Jake. Let's talk to the rest of the team.",2024-09-03 22:17:33
12139,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just told the coach I skipped practice, Jordan.",2024-09-03 21:32:37
12140,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,"Lisa, because you did, and it affected the whole team's performance. We had to cover for you.",2024-09-03 21:38:37
12141,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,But you could've talked to me first instead of going straight to the coach.,2024-09-03 21:43:37
12142,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,"I tried talking to you, but you avoided me and made up excuses. What was I supposed to do?",2024-09-03 21:50:37
12143,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,"You don't know what I'm dealing with at home. My parents are going through a divorce, and it’s been really tough.",2024-09-03 21:54:37
12144,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,"I had no idea, Lisa. I'm sorry you’re going through that. But you could've told us, we care about you.",2024-09-03 22:03:37
12145,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,I didn't think anyone would understand or care. I didn't want to burden the team with my problems.,2024-09-03 22:08:37
12146,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,"We're a team, right? We're here to support each other, both on and off the field.",2024-09-03 22:11:37
12147,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,"Ok, I get it. Next time, I’ll try to be more open. Can you not involve the coach right away?",2024-09-03 22:16:37
12148,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,I'll promise to talk to you first. Can you promise to communicate what's going on?,2024-09-03 22:18:37
12149,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_1,"Yeah, I can do that. Thanks, Jordan. Let's move past this and focus on getting better as a team.",2024-09-03 22:28:37
12150,deescalatory_conversation_264,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's work hard together and make sure we’re all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:35:37
12151,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up to the meeting yesterday? We were counting on you for the presentation.,2024-09-03 21:31:41
12152,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,"I had an emergency come up at work and couldn't get away. I should have let you know ahead of time, I'm sorry.",2024-09-03 21:40:41
12153,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,"It's not just about missing the meeting. We've been working on this project for weeks, and your part was crucial.",2024-09-03 21:43:41
12154,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,"I understand that, and I take full responsibility. Let's figure out how we can move forward from here.",2024-09-03 21:45:41
12155,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,It just feels like you've been less committed lately. Are you sure you can handle the responsibilities we agreed upon?,2024-09-03 21:53:41
12156,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,"I admit my attention has been divided, but I am committed to seeing this through. What can I do to reassure you?",2024-09-03 21:55:41
12157,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,Maybe we can set some clear deadlines and checkpoints so we both stay on track.,2024-09-03 22:04:41
12158,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,That's a good idea. How about we start with a status update this Friday and plan out smaller tasks?,2024-09-03 22:10:41
12159,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,"That works for me. I want this to succeed, and I need to know we can depend on each other.",2024-09-03 22:13:41
12160,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,You have my word. I'll make sure to communicate better and meet the deadlines we set.,2024-09-03 22:17:41
12161,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Let's get back on the same page and make this project a success.",2024-09-03 22:18:41
12162,deescalatory_conversation_265,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's do it.,2024-09-03 22:19:41
12163,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,Why did you change the project design without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:28:44
12164,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,I thought the new design was better for the deadline. We needed to make a decision quickly.,2024-09-03 21:33:44
12165,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,But we’re supposed to work as a team. You didn’t give me a chance to contribute.,2024-09-03 21:43:44
12166,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,"I understand that, but we were falling behind schedule. I was trying to keep us on track.",2024-09-03 21:53:44
12167,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,"I get that, but I feel sidelined. Can we discuss changes together next time?",2024-09-03 22:03:44
12168,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,Definitely. Your input is important. Let’s make sure we have a check-in before making any changes.,2024-09-03 22:06:44
12169,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,That sounds good. Maybe we can set a weekly meeting to discuss our progress and any necessary changes.,2024-09-03 22:11:44
12170,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,I like that idea. It will keep us both in the loop and help avoid misunderstandings.,2024-09-03 22:16:44
12171,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,"Okay, let’s start that from next week. We’ll be more aligned moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:21:44
12172,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for bringing this up. Communication is key.,2024-09-03 22:30:44
12173,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let’s get back to work and finish this project strong.,2024-09-03 22:39:44
12174,deescalatory_conversation_266,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let’s do it.",2024-09-03 22:47:44
12175,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"Hey, we've got to talk about how you're handling the project timeline.",2024-09-03 21:31:47
12176,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,What do you mean? I've been working hard on it.,2024-09-03 21:37:47
12177,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"I know you're putting in effort, but we're still consistently behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:42:47
12178,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,"I'm doing my part, but others need to step up too.",2024-09-03 21:46:47
12179,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_3,I feel like I'm being pulled in too many directions with different tasks. It's hard to keep up.,2024-09-03 21:52:47
12180,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"Ok, that's fair. Maybe we need to re-evaluate our task assignments?",2024-09-03 22:02:47
12181,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,That might help. Can we also set more realistic deadlines?,2024-09-03 22:05:47
12182,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_3,"Yes, I'm all for that. It feels like we're setting ourselves up for failure with the current ones.",2024-09-03 22:12:47
12183,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's look at the most urgent tasks and see what's achievable within the next week.,2024-09-03 22:21:47
12184,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,Sounds good. Can we also have a brief check-in every day to monitor progress?,2024-09-03 22:30:47
12185,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_3,I like that idea. It will help keep everyone on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:33:47
12186,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"Alright, let's start with a meeting tomorrow morning to reassign tasks and set new deadlines.",2024-09-03 22:34:47
12187,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_2,"Perfect, I'll bring the project plan so we can go over it together.",2024-09-03 22:43:47
12188,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_3,And I'll make sure to list down everything that's currently in progress. Looking forward to getting back on track.,2024-09-03 22:44:47
12189,deescalatory_conversation_267,speaker_1,"Great, thanks everyone for being open to this. Let's work",2024-09-03 22:52:47
12190,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Mark? We lost because of that!",2024-09-03 21:32:51
12191,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, Sarah. I was trying to make the best play I could.",2024-09-03 21:33:51
12192,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_3,"Come on, guys. Arguing about it isn't going to change the past. Let's figure out what went wrong and learn from it.",2024-09-03 21:41:51
12193,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,"Fine, but it was frustrating. I was right there and wide open.",2024-09-03 21:43:51
12194,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,"I get it, Sarah. Maybe I need to work on my awareness on the court. How can we improve our communication during the game?",2024-09-03 21:46:51
12195,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,"We definitely need to call out more and louder. If I had known you didn't see me, I would've moved somewhere more obvious.",2024-09-03 21:48:51
12196,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_3,"That's a good point. Also, maybe we should practice some visual signals for when we can't hear each other.",2024-09-03 21:57:51
12197,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,That sounds like a plan. And I'll make sure to look around more before making a pass. We need to trust each other.,2024-09-03 22:00:51
12198,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,Agreed. I didn't mean to snap. It's just frustrating to lose like that.,2024-09-03 22:07:51
12199,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_3,"We all want to win, but we need to remember we're a team. Let's focus on working together, not pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 22:11:51
12200,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_2,Exactly. Let's take this as a learning experience and come back stronger next game.,2024-09-03 22:13:51
12201,deescalatory_conversation_268,speaker_1,You're right. We can do this if we all communicate better and trust,2024-09-03 22:18:51
12202,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the group presentation, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:25:55
12203,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Sarah. Something urgent came up at home.",2024-09-03 21:26:55
12204,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,You should have at least let us know. We had to cover for you last minute.,2024-09-03 21:28:55
12205,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,"I know, and I really apologize. I should have communicated better.",2024-09-03 21:36:55
12206,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_3,"Jake, it's not just about this presentation. You've missed several meetings before, too.",2024-09-03 21:41:55
12207,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,"I understand, Tom. I didn't realize it was affecting everyone this much.",2024-09-03 21:43:55
12208,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,So what do we do now? We can't keep picking up the slack for you.,2024-09-03 21:45:55
12209,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,How about I take on an extra task to make up for it? Maybe I can handle the research for our next project.,2024-09-03 21:47:55
12210,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_3,"That sounds fair, but we need to trust you'll follow through this time.",2024-09-03 21:49:55
12211,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,I promise I'll prove it to you. Can we set up regular check-ins to keep me accountable?,2024-09-03 21:54:55
12212,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,"Alright, we can give that a try. Let's meet twice a week to make sure we're all on track.",2024-09-03 22:02:55
12213,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's focus on moving forward and getting this project done right.,2024-09-03 22:03:55
12214,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_2,"Thanks for giving me another chance, guys. I'll make sure not to let you down again.",2024-09-03 22:11:55
12215,deescalatory_conversation_269,speaker_1,"Okay, let's get back to work then. We've got a lot to do.",2024-09-03 22:20:55
12216,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,Why did you basically ignore all of our suggestions for the group project?,2024-09-03 21:32:59
12217,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,I didn't ignore them. I thought we were going in a different direction.,2024-09-03 21:42:59
12218,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,"We agreed on a plan last week, and then you submitted something totally different.",2024-09-03 21:46:59
12219,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_3,"Yeah, it's like you just decided on your own what was best.",2024-09-03 21:48:59
12220,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,I wasn't trying to override you guys; I thought I was making improvements.,2024-09-03 21:49:59
12221,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_3,But you didn't even ask us. That's the problem.,2024-09-03 21:58:59
12222,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,"We need to work together, not just make decisions alone.",2024-09-03 22:05:59
12223,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,You're right. Maybe I should have communicated better.,2024-09-03 22:07:59
12224,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_3,Maybe? Definitely. We can't keep going like this.,2024-09-03 22:12:59
12225,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,"Okay, let's regroup and figure out how to fix this together.",2024-09-03 22:20:59
12226,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,Can we try to stick to agreeing on steps before making changes?,2024-09-03 22:23:59
12227,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,"Yes, absolutely. I'll run everything by you guys first from now on.",2024-09-03 22:26:59
12228,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_3,Good. We just want to be on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:29:59
12229,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,Understood. How about we set up regular check-ins?,2024-09-03 22:34:59
12230,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,That sounds like a solid plan. How often should we meet?,2024-09-03 22:35:59
12231,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_3,Maybe twice a week? That way we can catch any issues early.,2024-09-03 22:43:59
12232,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_2,Twice a week works for me. Let's do it.,2024-09-03 22:47:59
12233,deescalatory_conversation_270,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's make this project,2024-09-03 22:57:59
12234,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball during the last play, Sam? We could have scored!",2024-09-03 21:28:02
12235,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, Jess. I thought I had a better shot.",2024-09-03 21:33:02
12236,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,"But you missed, and now we're down by ten. This isn't the first time this has happened.",2024-09-03 21:38:02
12237,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"I get it, okay? But it's not like I’m doing it on purpose. I'm trying my best out there.",2024-09-03 21:47:02
12238,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,"Maybe, but we need to play as a team. Can we at least agree to communicate more on the court?",2024-09-03 21:49:02
12239,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can agree to that. I’ll make an effort to look for you next time. Can you help by calling for the ball louder?",2024-09-03 21:58:02
12240,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,"Sure, I can do that. I suppose it's a two-way street. We're both in this together.",2024-09-03 22:05:02
12241,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,"Right, and honestly, when we play as a team, we’re unbeatable. Let's focus on that.",2024-09-03 22:14:02
12242,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's get back out there and turn this game around.,2024-09-03 22:20:02
12243,deescalatory_conversation_271,speaker_2,Let’s do it!,2024-09-03 22:30:02
12244,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 21:33:04
12245,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,I didn't know we had to ask for that.,2024-09-03 21:39:04
12246,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,It's common courtesy to check if others want some too.,2024-09-03 21:46:04
12247,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"Okay, but it was just a piece of cake. Is it really that big of a deal?",2024-09-03 21:55:04
12248,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,It's not just about the cake; it's about being considerate of everyone.,2024-09-03 22:05:04
12249,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,I get that now. I should've asked first. Sorry.,2024-09-03 22:13:04
12250,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,Thank you for understanding. Let's just make sure we check next time.,2024-09-03 22:18:04
12251,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll remember that.",2024-09-03 22:27:04
12252,deescalatory_conversation_272,speaker_1,"Great, I appreciate it. Let's move on and enjoy the evening.",2024-09-03 22:31:04
12253,deescalatory_conversation_273,#### Scenario,Two friends planning a trip get into an argument about the itinerary,2024-09-03 21:28:08
12254,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,I think we should spend an extra day at the beach. We hardly get time to relax anymore.,2024-09-03 21:36:08
12255,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,But we also want to explore the mountains. We only have a limited number of days.,2024-09-03 21:44:08
12256,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,"I know, but I feel like we always rush through our trips. Can't we just relax for once?",2024-09-03 21:46:08
12257,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,"I get that, but the mountains are important to me. I was really looking forward to the hike.",2024-09-03 21:55:08
12258,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,How about we cut down some other activities instead? We don't have to do everything.,2024-09-03 21:56:08
12259,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,Like what? Everything else seems pretty essential to our plan.,2024-09-03 22:00:08
12260,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,Maybe we can skip the city tour. It's not like we haven't seen cities before.,2024-09-03 22:06:08
12261,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,I guess that's possible. City tours are often similar.,2024-09-03 22:13:08
12262,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,Exactly. We can use that time to unwind and still get to hike the mountains.,2024-09-03 22:23:08
12263,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,"Okay, how about we shorten the beach day a little and still leave room for the hike?",2024-09-03 22:30:08
12264,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,That seems reasonable. A few hours at the beach should be refreshing enough.,2024-09-03 22:36:08
12265,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,"Perfect. And if we feel energetic afterward, we can still do a short city tour.",2024-09-03 22:43:08
12266,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_1,Sounds like a solid plan. Thanks for being flexible.,2024-09-03 22:49:08
12267,deescalatory_conversation_273,speaker_2,No problem. I just want us to have a great,2024-09-03 22:55:08
12268,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,"Tim, why didn’t you tell me you were struggling with the new project?",2024-09-03 21:30:12
12269,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,"I didn’t think it was a big deal, Marta. I thought I could handle it on my own.",2024-09-03 21:37:12
12270,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,"But you clearly weren’t managing. The deadline is next week, and we’re far behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:46:12
12271,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,"I know, but I didn’t want to bother you. You’ve got your own tasks to handle.",2024-09-03 21:53:12
12272,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,"I understand that, but we’re a team. We need to support each other. Why didn’t you ask for help sooner?",2024-09-03 21:57:12
12273,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,I guess I was afraid you'd think I wasn't capable enough.,2024-09-03 22:07:12
12274,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,"Tim, admitting you need help doesn’t make you any less capable. It shows you care about our success.",2024-09-03 22:15:12
12275,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,"Yeah, I see your point. I just didn't want to let anyone down.",2024-09-03 22:23:12
12276,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,The only way we can let the team down is by not communicating. We need to share our struggles so we can work through them together.,2024-09-03 22:33:12
12277,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,"I get that now. So, what can we do to catch up?",2024-09-03 22:34:12
12278,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,Let’s sit down and divide the tasks more realistically. We’ll prioritize what’s most urgent and see who else can lend a hand.,2024-09-03 22:37:12
12279,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_2,That sounds good. I’ll be more upfront about my progress from now on.,2024-09-03 22:41:12
12280,deescalatory_conversation_274,speaker_1,"Great, and I’ll make sure",2024-09-03 22:43:12
12281,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and changed the project without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:35:17
12282,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was such a big deal. We needed to get it done, and you weren't around.",2024-09-03 21:41:17
12283,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,But that wasn't the plan we agreed on. We were supposed to discuss any changes together.,2024-09-03 21:43:17
12284,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"I understand that, but time was running out, and I had to make a call. I thought you would agree with the changes.",2024-09-03 21:45:17
12285,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,It just feels like you don't respect my input. This project is important to both of us.,2024-09-03 21:55:17
12286,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"I'm sorry you feel that way. I do respect your input, but I thought that in this situation, speed was more important.",2024-09-03 22:00:17
12287,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,"Maybe you could have texted me or something, at least to inform me about what you were doing.",2024-09-03 22:08:17
12288,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. How can we fix this moving forward?,2024-09-03 22:10:17
12289,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,"Let's set up a system where we can quickly update each other on any changes, even if it's last minute.",2024-09-03 22:12:17
12290,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,That sounds fair. Do you have any suggestions on how we can do that?,2024-09-03 22:18:17
12291,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,Maybe we could use a shared document where we note any changes and set up instant notifications.,2024-09-03 22:20:17
12292,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_2,"I like that idea. That way, neither of us will feel out of the loop.",2024-09-03 22:29:17
12293,deescalatory_conversation_275,speaker_1,And let's agree to hold a quick call,2024-09-03 22:31:17
12294,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the group study session yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:35:20
12295,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"I had other commitments, okay?",2024-09-03 21:41:20
12296,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,But you didn't even let us know. We were counting on you to cover the last chapter.,2024-09-03 21:46:20
12297,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,I didn't realize it was that big of a deal. Can't you understand that I have my own stuff going on?,2024-09-03 21:49:20
12298,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,"I understand, but a quick message would have helped us plan better.",2024-09-03 21:50:20
12299,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"Alright, I get it. I should have told you. What's done is done. What can I do to help now?",2024-09-03 21:51:20
12300,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,We need to go over the key points from the last chapter before the quiz tomorrow. Can you join us later today?,2024-09-03 21:58:20
12301,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"Yes, I can join later today. What time works for everyone?",2024-09-03 22:07:20
12302,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,"How about 5 PM? That way, we still have the evening free.",2024-09-03 22:14:20
12303,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,"5 PM is fine with me. Thanks for understanding, and I'll be there on time.",2024-09-03 22:21:20
12304,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_1,"Great, I'll let everyone else know. Let's make sure we nail this quiz.",2024-09-03 22:25:20
12305,deescalatory_conversation_276,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for giving me another chance to contribute.,2024-09-03 22:35:20
12306,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,I don't understand why you submitted the funding report without consulting the team first.,2024-09-03 21:26:23
12307,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,I had to get it in before the deadline. There was no time to gather everyone’s input.,2024-09-03 21:34:23
12308,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,But we agreed that all major reports would be reviewed by the team. This could impact our project’s credibility.,2024-09-03 21:37:23
12309,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,I didn’t mean to bypass the process. I thought meeting the deadline was most important.,2024-09-03 21:40:23
12310,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,"Meeting the deadline is crucial, but so is maintaining our process. Can we find a balance going forward?",2024-09-03 21:41:23
12311,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,I’m open to suggestions. What do you think would work best for tight deadlines?,2024-09-03 21:43:23
12312,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,"Maybe we can have a quick meeting or a designated reviewer for urgent reports. That way, we can at least ensure someone else checks it.",2024-09-03 21:47:23
12313,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,I like that. A designated reviewer sounds efficient. I can volunteer for that role if needed.,2024-09-03 21:57:23
12314,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,Great. Let’s also draft a quick checklist for urgent reports so we stay on track.,2024-09-03 22:03:23
12315,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,"Agreed. This way, we can maintain quality and meet deadlines without friction.",2024-09-03 22:12:23
12316,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,Perfect. Let’s inform the rest of the team about this new approach. I believe it will benefit everyone.,2024-09-03 22:13:23
12317,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_2,I'll draft an email and schedule a short meeting to discuss this. Thanks for bringing it up constructively.,2024-09-03 22:16:23
12318,deescalatory_conversation_277,speaker_1,Thank you for understanding and working on a solution together,2024-09-03 22:26:23
12319,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,Why did you use my idea for the project without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:35:26
12320,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,I thought we were working as a team and it wouldn't matter who suggested what.,2024-09-03 21:44:26
12321,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,But you didn't give me any credit. It feels like you took all the work I did and made it your own.,2024-09-03 21:52:26
12322,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,I'm sorry if it came across that way. I really didn't mean to exclude you.,2024-09-03 21:59:26
12323,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,It just feels unfair. Can we agree on how to give each other credit from now on?,2024-09-03 22:05:26
12324,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,That's a good idea. Maybe we can make a list of contributions and agree on how to present them?,2024-09-03 22:14:26
12325,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,I would appreciate that. It would mean a lot to me if our efforts were recognized equally.,2024-09-03 22:23:26
12326,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's start working on that list so both of us get the recognition we deserve.,2024-09-03 22:33:26
12327,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_1,Thanks. I think this will help us avoid misunderstandings in the future.,2024-09-03 22:40:26
12328,deescalatory_conversation_278,speaker_2,"Agreed. We're a team, and it's important that we both feel valued.",2024-09-03 22:49:26
12329,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"I saw your name on the sign-up sheet for the team project, but you haven't shown up to any of the meetings.",2024-09-03 21:31:29
12330,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"Yeah, I've been really busy with other classes. I thought you guys could handle it.",2024-09-03 21:37:29
12331,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"Well, we need everyone to contribute. It's a group project, after all.",2024-09-03 21:47:29
12332,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"I get that, but my schedule is seriously packed. You can't expect me to be at every meeting.",2024-09-03 21:48:29
12333,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"I understand schedules are tough, but we all have other classes too. How do you think we can work this out?",2024-09-03 21:54:29
12334,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,"Maybe you can just tell me what to do, and I'll do my part on my own time?",2024-09-03 21:57:29
12335,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"That could work, but we really need to make sure everyone's contributions align. Could you at least make it to the next meeting?",2024-09-03 22:02:29
12336,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,I suppose I can try to move some things around. What time is it?,2024-09-03 22:11:29
12337,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,It's at 3 PM on Thursday. Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 22:19:29
12338,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,I think I can manage that.,2024-09-03 22:23:29
12339,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_1,"Alright, great. We'll catch you up on everything. Let's just make sure we're all on the same page moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:27:29
12340,deescalatory_conversation_279,speaker_2,Fair enough. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:31:29
12341,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you change the marketing strategy without discussing it with us first?",2024-09-03 21:32:33
12342,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,"I thought the previous plan wasn’t working well. The numbers weren’t improving, so I made a judgment call.",2024-09-03 21:41:33
12343,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_1,But we’re a team; we should make these decisions together. You acting alone undermines our trust.,2024-09-03 21:50:33
12344,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,I get that. I guess I was just frustrated and wanted to see immediate results. I didn’t think it through.,2024-09-03 21:51:33
12345,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_3,"We understand that the situation is stressful for everyone, but we need to stay coordinated. Can we go over the changes you made?",2024-09-03 21:57:33
12346,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,"Sure, I focused more on social media ads and reduced the budget for print ads. I thought we’d reach a younger audience that way.",2024-09-03 22:00:33
12347,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_1,"That actually makes sense, but we need a balanced approach. What if we allocate a portion of the budget to both and monitor the results closely?",2024-09-03 22:10:33
12348,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I’ll make sure to consult you guys next time before making any big changes.,2024-09-03 22:11:33
12349,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_3,We appreciate that. Let’s all agree on weekly check-ins to review our strategy together. How does that sound?,2024-09-03 22:15:33
12350,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_2,Agreed. It’s important that we all stay on the same page. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:21:33
12351,deescalatory_conversation_280,speaker_1,No problem. Let’s make this work and improve our performance together.,2024-09-03 22:31:33
12352,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't include my data in the presentation, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:35:37
12353,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,"Kate, I didn't think it was relevant to the overall findings we were discussing.",2024-09-03 21:39:37
12354,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,But my data provided a different perspective that would have strengthened our argument!,2024-09-03 21:42:37
12355,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,"I understand you feel that way, but we had limited time and I had to make quick decisions.",2024-09-03 21:48:37
12356,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,Could you at least have discussed it with me first?,2024-09-03 21:53:37
12357,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have consulted you before making that call. What can we do to ensure this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 21:55:37
12358,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,Maybe we could have a quick meeting before finalizing presentations to review all the data together?,2024-09-03 21:56:37
12359,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. It would definitely help us avoid miscommunications like this in the future.,2024-09-03 21:58:37
12360,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I just want to make sure all our work is considered.,2024-09-03 22:03:37
12361,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Kate. Your input is valuable, and I'll make sure it gets included from now on.",2024-09-03 22:06:37
12362,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,Great. Let's work together to make the next presentation even better.,2024-09-03 22:11:37
12363,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's start by going over all the data we have for the upcoming project.,2024-09-03 22:12:37
12364,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,Perfect. How about we meet tomorrow afternoon to discuss it?,2024-09-03 22:16:37
12365,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,Tomorrow afternoon works for me. See you then.,2024-09-03 22:26:37
12366,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_1,"Looking forward to it. Thanks, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:32:37
12367,deescalatory_conversation_281,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:33:37
12368,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,"What were you thinking, James? You can’t just skip practice whenever you feel like it.",2024-09-03 21:35:41
12369,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework, coach. I didn't see the point in coming if I couldn’t focus.",2024-09-03 21:45:41
12370,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,"Everyone has homework, but you don’t see them slacking off. We’re a team, your presence matters.",2024-09-03 21:49:41
12371,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_3,"James, we were all counting on you. You missed an important drill that’s crucial for the upcoming game.",2024-09-03 21:55:41
12372,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,"I get that, but balancing school and sports isn’t easy. Maybe we could adjust the schedule a bit?",2024-09-03 21:58:41
12373,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,"Adjusting the schedule affects everyone, not just you. We need commitment from each member.",2024-09-03 22:07:41
12374,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_3,"It’s true, but maybe there’s a middle ground here. Could we perhaps designate specific times for study breaks?",2024-09-03 22:09:41
12375,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,"I’m open to ideas if it means a better balance. James, would that help you stay committed?",2024-09-03 22:11:41
12376,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,"Definitely, if I knew there was time set aside for homework, it’d be much easier to manage both.",2024-09-03 22:19:41
12377,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_1,"Alright, let’s try incorporating a short study period into our practice schedule. But you need to stick to it.",2024-09-03 22:27:41
12378,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_2,"I will. Thanks for understanding, coach, and sorry for missing practice.",2024-09-03 22:31:41
12379,deescalatory_conversation_282,speaker_3,Let’s just make sure we all communicate better next time. We’re in this together.,2024-09-03 22:34:41
12380,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just did that, Emily. Why did you submit the group project without telling me?",2024-09-03 21:35:45
12381,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,"I thought it was done, Josh. You were taking too long to respond to my messages.",2024-09-03 21:42:45
12382,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,But I was still working on the final presentation slides! We could’ve gotten a better grade.,2024-09-03 21:46:45
12383,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,I didn't know you were still working on it. You should have told me.,2024-09-03 21:49:45
12384,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,I did! I texted you last night about needing more time. Didn’t you see it?,2024-09-03 21:59:45
12385,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,"Oh, I must have missed that message. But you know the deadline was today. We couldn’t risk being late.",2024-09-03 22:02:45
12386,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,"I get that, but a heads-up would’ve been nice before you submitted it.",2024-09-03 22:11:45
12387,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,You're right. I should’ve checked in with you first. Communication hasn’t been great between us this past week.,2024-09-03 22:19:45
12388,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,"Yeah, we both could improve on that. Let’s make sure we discuss and confirm together next time before any submission.",2024-09-03 22:22:45
12389,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,"Agreed. We both have good ideas, but if we don’t collaborate properly, it doesn’t work out well.",2024-09-03 22:30:45
12390,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_1,Can we talk to the professor and see if we can re-submit the final slides? It might show we're taking initiative to fix our mistakes.,2024-09-03 22:35:45
12391,deescalatory_conversation_283,speaker_2,That might be worth a try. Let’s go talk to him together after class.,2024-09-03 22:45:45
12392,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the game?,2024-09-03 21:30:51
12393,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,"I didn't see you were open. Besides, I thought going for the goal myself was the best option.",2024-09-03 21:33:51
12394,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,But I was clearly in a better position! It's like you don't trust my abilities.,2024-09-03 21:35:51
12395,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,It's not about trust. I just made a split-second decision. Let's discuss how we can communicate better on the field.,2024-09-03 21:44:51
12396,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,"Fine, but it happens every game. Can we devise some signals or something?",2024-09-03 21:50:51
12397,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,"Sure, we could come up with hand signals or even call out more distinctly. What do you think would be more effective?",2024-09-03 21:54:51
12398,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,Hand signals might work better. Sometimes it's too noisy to hear anything. What kind of signals could we use?,2024-09-03 21:59:51
12399,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,"Maybe we could try simple gestures like a raised hand for passing, or a quick wave for taking a shot.",2024-09-03 22:01:51
12400,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. Do you think our teammates would be on board with this too?,2024-09-03 22:06:51
12401,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,We can bring it up in the next team meeting and see what everyone thinks. It's about improving our game as a whole.,2024-09-03 22:10:51
12402,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_1,"Okay, let's do that. I appreciate that we're working towards a solution.",2024-09-03 22:20:51
12403,deescalatory_conversation_284,speaker_2,Me too. It's important that we trust each other on the field. Let's make this work.,2024-09-03 22:30:51
12404,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you tell me about the project deadline extension?",2024-09-03 21:31:55
12405,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,I didn't know you needed to know. You seemed on top of things.,2024-09-03 21:36:55
12406,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,Of course I needed to know! I'm your project partner. How could you assume otherwise?,2024-09-03 21:39:55
12407,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,"Okay, I get it. I should have communicated better. But you could have asked too, you know.",2024-09-03 21:48:55
12408,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,"Maybe, but I've been swamped with my other classes. Communication is a two-way street.",2024-09-03 21:57:55
12409,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,You're right. I should've made sure you were updated. How can we make this right?,2024-09-03 22:03:55
12410,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,Let's sit down and review where we're at. We can split the remaining tasks and make sure we’re on track together.,2024-09-03 22:10:55
12411,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,That sounds like a plan. I’ll make a list of what we have left and we can tackle it piece by piece.,2024-09-03 22:20:55
12412,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,"Perfect. Let's set up meeting times for the rest of the week, too, so we don't fall behind again.",2024-09-03 22:30:55
12413,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'll send you my availability, and we can book our slots.",2024-09-03 22:38:55
12414,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's nail this project.,2024-09-03 22:41:55
12415,deescalatory_conversation_285,speaker_2,Absolutely. Teamwork makes the dream work!,2024-09-03 22:50:55
12416,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,We need to talk about the group project for history class.,2024-09-03 21:31:59
12417,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,"Okay, what's the issue this time?",2024-09-03 21:34:59
12418,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,I've noticed that you've been missing the last few meetings.,2024-09-03 21:40:59
12419,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,I've had a lot going on. Does that really matter?,2024-09-03 21:41:59
12420,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_3,"It does matter, because we're falling behind on our timeline.",2024-09-03 21:46:59
12421,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,I've been doing my part in the research. You can’t deny that.,2024-09-03 21:54:59
12422,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,"True, but it's not just about individual tasks. We need to communicate more.",2024-09-03 22:04:59
12423,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_3,"Yeah, coordination is key. We can’t afford to work in silos.",2024-09-03 22:07:59
12424,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,"Alright, fair point. How can we fix this?",2024-09-03 22:14:59
12425,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,Maybe we can set specific times for online check-ins that work for everyone.,2024-09-03 22:20:59
12426,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_3,I agree. A fixed schedule might help us stay on track better.,2024-09-03 22:21:59
12427,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,I can do evenings. Does that work for you guys?,2024-09-03 22:27:59
12428,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,Evenings are fine with me.,2024-09-03 22:37:59
12429,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_3,Evenings work for me too. Let's lock those in.,2024-09-03 22:47:59
12430,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_2,"Great, I'm sorry for missing out before. I'll stick to the schedule.",2024-09-03 22:56:59
12431,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's aim to finish strong.,2024-09-03 23:02:59
12432,deescalatory_conversation_286,speaker_3,Agreed. We're all in this together. Let's nail it.,2024-09-03 23:04:59
12433,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,I can't believe you used my photos without asking.,2024-09-03 21:28:02
12434,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,"I thought they were just lying around, and everyone could use them.",2024-09-03 21:31:02
12435,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,"They were part of a personal project, not for everyone.",2024-09-03 21:34:02
12436,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, I didn't know. Can we figure out a way to fix this?",2024-09-03 21:39:02
12437,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,"I need those photos back, and I also need you to understand my boundaries.",2024-09-03 21:45:02
12438,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,"Sure, I'll return them immediately. How can I respect your boundaries better in the future?",2024-09-03 21:53:02
12439,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,Please just ask before you decide to use something that isn't yours.,2024-09-03 22:03:02
12440,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll make sure to ask next time. Are you okay with collaborating on anything else?",2024-09-03 22:09:02
12441,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_1,"We can collaborate, as long as we communicate clearly. I appreciate your understanding.",2024-09-03 22:10:02
12442,deescalatory_conversation_287,speaker_2,"I really am sorry, and I'll do better. Let's make sure we talk more about our projects.",2024-09-03 22:13:02
12443,deescalatory_conversation_288,**Scenario,Two co-founders of a startup debating a critical business decision**,2024-09-03 21:31:06
12444,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,We should definitely go for the merger. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.,2024-09-03 21:37:06
12445,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"I understand the opportunity, but it comes with a lot of risks. What about our current team's job security?",2024-09-03 21:41:06
12446,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,"I agree there are risks, but think about the growth potential. We can scale much faster.",2024-09-03 21:47:06
12447,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"Scaling fast is one thing, but we need stability first. Have you considered how it might affect our company culture?",2024-09-03 21:53:06
12448,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,That's a valid concern. Maybe we can negotiate parts of the deal to protect our culture. How do you see that working?,2024-09-03 22:00:06
12449,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,We could structure it so that our team remains intact and we integrate their systems gradually. Does that seem feasible?,2024-09-03 22:05:06
12450,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,"Yes, that could work. We could request to maintain our management structure. What do you think about setting up a meeting with their CEO to discuss this?",2024-09-03 22:12:06
12451,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,That sounds like a good step forward. Should we also consult our team to get their input before making any final decisions?,2024-09-03 22:21:06
12452,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,"Absolutely, their feedback is crucial. Let's set up a meeting with our team first and then reach out to their CEO.",2024-09-03 22:25:06
12453,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_2,"Agreed. That way, we’re considering every angle. Let's draft a plan and present it to everyone tomorrow.",2024-09-03 22:32:06
12454,deescalatory_conversation_288,speaker_1,"Perfect, I'll start working on the presentation.",2024-09-03 22:37:06
12455,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,Why did you delete my character from the game?,2024-09-03 21:36:10
12456,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,It was an accident. I thought it was my save file.,2024-09-03 21:45:10
12457,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,How could you mix that up? You know I've been working on that character for weeks!,2024-09-03 21:51:10
12458,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,"I know, I'm really sorry. Is there any way we can restore it?",2024-09-03 21:57:10
12459,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,I don't think so. The game doesn't have backups for individual save files.,2024-09-03 22:07:10
12460,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,Maybe we can contact support. Sometimes they can help with this kind of thing.,2024-09-03 22:11:10
12461,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,"I don't know if they can, but I suppose it's worth a try. I'll look up their contact information.",2024-09-03 22:12:10
12462,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,Let me help with that. I feel terrible about what happened.,2024-09-03 22:13:10
12463,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate your willingness to help fix this.,2024-09-03 22:20:10
12464,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,Of course. I'll keep looking for solutions while you contact support.,2024-09-03 22:23:10
12465,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,"Okay, I'll start drafting an email to them now.",2024-09-03 22:29:10
12466,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,Keep me updated on what they say. I'll keep researching in the meantime.,2024-09-03 22:30:10
12467,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_1,Will do. Let's stay positive and hope we can recover it.,2024-09-03 22:31:10
12468,deescalatory_conversation_289,speaker_2,Agreed. Together we'll figure this out.,2024-09-03 22:37:10
12469,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,"Why are you always so late to band practice, Chris?",2024-09-03 21:29:13
12470,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,"I have a lot of work to do for school, okay? Not everyone has as much free time as you.",2024-09-03 21:34:13
12471,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,"We're all busy, you know. But the band needs everyone to be committed, or it just doesn’t work.",2024-09-03 21:40:13
12472,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,"I get that, but I'm barely keeping up with my homework. Cut me some slack.",2024-09-03 21:41:13
12473,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_3,"Chris, we know school is important. Can you let us know ahead of time if you're going to be late so we can adjust?",2024-09-03 21:51:13
12474,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,Right! We could work on other parts or give you a specific time to join in.,2024-09-03 21:53:13
12475,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,I hadn't thought of that. Maybe I can let you know earlier if I think I might be late. But can we make some practices a bit shorter?,2024-09-03 22:02:13
12476,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_3,"I think we can find a middle ground. Shorter practices if needed, but let’s stay focused when we’re together.",2024-09-03 22:03:13
12477,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_1,Agreed. And we’ll rotate tasks so no one gets too overwhelmed. Sound good?,2024-09-03 22:06:13
12478,deescalatory_conversation_290,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I’ll do my best to keep you all informed. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:13:13
12479,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and changed the presentation slides without talking to me first.,2024-09-03 21:30:18
12480,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,"I made those changes because we were running out of time, and I thought they would improve our chances.",2024-09-03 21:37:18
12481,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,But you completely removed the market analysis. That was my main contribution.,2024-09-03 21:39:18
12482,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,"Yeah, but I added more detailed financial projections, which I thought were more important for our investors.",2024-09-03 21:47:18
12483,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,We could have at least discussed it first. I feel like my work was disregarded.,2024-09-03 21:53:18
12484,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to undermine your efforts. Can we find a way to include both the market analysis and the financial projections?,2024-09-03 21:56:18
12485,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Maybe we can shorten the introduction to make room for both sections.,2024-09-03 22:06:18
12486,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,Great idea. How about we sit down together and go through each slide to make sure we're both happy with the final product?,2024-09-03 22:14:18
12487,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,"I appreciate that. Let's do it. And next time, let's make sure we communicate before making any big changes.",2024-09-03 22:16:18
12488,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,Agreed. Communication should definitely be our priority moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:26:18
12489,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I think this will make our presentation even stronger.,2024-09-03 22:30:18
12490,deescalatory_conversation_291,speaker_2,Definitely. I'm glad we had this conversation. Let's get to work.,2024-09-03 22:36:18
12491,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,"You know, Jenna, I didn't appreciate you jumping in and taking over my part of the presentation today.",2024-09-03 21:33:24
12492,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,"Alex, I thought you needed help, and I was just trying to make sure we did well. I didn’t mean to step on your toes.",2024-09-03 21:36:24
12493,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,"I get that, but I felt like you didn't trust me to handle it. It’s frustrating when you do that.",2024-09-03 21:40:24
12494,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,I see what you're saying. Maybe I was a bit overzealous. I should have given you more space to present your part.,2024-09-03 21:46:24
12495,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I just want to make sure we both get a fair chance to contribute. How about we plan our sections more clearly next time?,2024-09-03 21:52:24
12496,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,That sounds good. Let's meet up before our next project to go over everything in detail so we're on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:53:24
12497,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,Agreed. I think that will make things run smoother and avoid any misunderstanding.,2024-09-03 22:00:24
12498,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,"Definitely. I appreciate you bringing this up, Alex. It’s important that we work well together as a team.",2024-09-03 22:04:24
12499,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jenna. I feel a lot better now that we’ve talked about it. Let’s nail the next presentation.",2024-09-03 22:06:24
12500,deescalatory_conversation_292,speaker_2,Absolutely. We got this!,2024-09-03 22:14:24
12501,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell us about the change in the project deadline earlier?,2024-09-03 21:35:28
12502,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,I just found out about it myself this morning. I was going to send a message as soon as I got a chance.,2024-09-03 21:38:28
12503,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,But now we're all in a scramble trying to adjust our schedules. This is really stressful.,2024-09-03 21:42:28
12504,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,"I understand, and I'm feeling the pressure too. Maybe we can discuss breaking down the tasks to manage time better.",2024-09-03 21:47:28
12505,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_3,It's also frustrating because some of us had already planned around the original deadline.,2024-09-03 21:48:28
12506,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,"Absolutely, and I'm really sorry for that. Can we come up with a revised plan together to handle the new timeline?",2024-09-03 21:49:28
12507,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Let's see how we can redistribute the workload to match the new deadline.,2024-09-03 21:56:28
12508,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_3,"Yeah, maybe we can each prioritize specific sections and provide updates more frequently.",2024-09-03 21:57:28
12509,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,That's a good idea. How about I take on the most urgent parts and you both can take on the other sections?,2024-09-03 22:05:28
12510,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,Agreed. And let's set up a quick daily check-in to keep track of our progress.,2024-09-03 22:12:28
12511,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_3,"Yes, and let's make sure to keep open communication so we can support each other better.",2024-09-03 22:22:28
12512,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. I'll draft a new plan and send it out in the next hour.,2024-09-03 22:24:28
12513,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let's get back to work and make this happen.,2024-09-03 22:30:28
12514,deescalatory_conversation_293,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:36:28
12515,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,I noticed you’ve been avoiding group meetings lately.,2024-09-03 21:30:31
12516,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,"Yeah, I’ve just been busy with other projects.",2024-09-03 21:38:31
12517,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,"We all have busy schedules, but we committed to this class project together.",2024-09-03 21:43:31
12518,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,"I get it, but I feel like my input isn't valued anyway.",2024-09-03 21:50:31
12519,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,Your input is definitely valued. Remember the last presentation? Your data analysis was crucial.,2024-09-03 21:52:31
12520,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,"Maybe, but I feel like I'm always on the sidelines.",2024-09-03 21:53:31
12521,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_3,We don’t want anyone to feel sidelined. What can we do to make you feel more included?,2024-09-03 22:00:31
12522,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,"Maybe if I had more responsibility or a specific task, I'd feel more involved.",2024-09-03 22:01:31
12523,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,That’s a fair request. How about taking the lead on the design part for our next project segment?,2024-09-03 22:04:31
12524,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_3,I think that would be a great way to leverage your strengths and ensure your contribution is front and center.,2024-09-03 22:05:31
12525,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,I appreciate that. I’ll take the lead on the design then.,2024-09-03 22:08:31
12526,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_1,"Great, and let’s set up a quick check-in meeting so we can all stay in the loop.",2024-09-03 22:15:31
12527,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_3,Sounds good. Communication is key to making sure everyone feels included.,2024-09-03 22:16:31
12528,deescalatory_conversation_294,speaker_2,Agreed. I'm looking forward to working more closely with you both.,2024-09-03 22:25:31
12529,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you pass the ball in the last match? We were wide open!",2024-09-03 21:29:35
12530,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,I thought I could score. The angle seemed good from my position.,2024-09-03 21:33:35
12531,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,"But you missed, and we ended up losing the match because of that.",2024-09-03 21:41:35
12532,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,"Yeah, I know, but it's not like I'm the only one who made mistakes. We all had issues on defense too.",2024-09-03 21:51:35
12533,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,Both of you need to chill. Pointing fingers won't help us get better. Can we focus on what went wrong and how we can improve?,2024-09-03 21:55:35
12534,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,"Okay, you're right. Maybe we should look at our defensive line first.",2024-09-03 21:59:35
12535,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,I agree. Our communication was off. We need to work on signaling each other during the game.,2024-09-03 22:06:35
12536,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,Good point. How about we spend extra time on drills to improve our positioning and communication?,2024-09-03 22:07:35
12537,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,I like that idea. And let's also practice different scenarios where we can pass more effectively.,2024-09-03 22:14:35
12538,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,Sounds good to me. And I'll definitely work on my decision-making skills when it comes to taking shots.,2024-09-03 22:21:35
12539,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,"Great, we're all on the same page now. Let's use this to come back stronger in the next game.",2024-09-03 22:25:35
12540,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_1,Agreed. We can do this together.,2024-09-03 22:33:35
12541,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's make sure we support each other both on and off the field.,2024-09-03 22:42:35
12542,deescalatory_conversation_295,speaker_3,Perfect. Teamwork,2024-09-03 22:52:35
12543,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,Why didn’t you pass me the ball in the last play? We could have scored and won the game!,2024-09-03 21:36:40
12544,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,"I didn’t see you open, and I thought I had a good shot. I’m sorry if it seemed like I ignored you.",2024-09-03 21:44:40
12545,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,"Well, it felt like you didn’t trust me to make the shot, and that’s frustrating.",2024-09-03 21:48:40
12546,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,I get that. I should have communicated better. Let’s work on our signals for next time so we’re on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:55:40
12547,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,"Yeah, that might help. We need to make sure we know where each other are on the court at all times.",2024-09-03 22:02:40
12548,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,"Agreed. And maybe after practice, we can spend some time running those plays together to build that trust.",2024-09-03 22:04:40
12549,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,"That’s a good idea. If we practice more, we’ll probably avoid misunderstandings during the game.",2024-09-03 22:14:40
12550,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,Definitely. Let’s also talk to the coach about integrating it into our drills so the whole team can get better.,2024-09-03 22:22:40
12551,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,"Sounds like a plan. We’re in this together, and improving communication will definitely help us win more games.",2024-09-03 22:28:40
12552,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let’s make this a turning point for the rest of the season.,2024-09-03 22:32:40
12553,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_1,"Alright, let’s keep our heads up and focus on the next game.",2024-09-03 22:37:40
12554,deescalatory_conversation_296,speaker_2,We’ve got this. Thanks for talking it out with me,2024-09-03 22:47:40
12555,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,"I can't believe you deleted our project file, Sarah!",2024-09-03 21:30:44
12556,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"It was an accident, Mark. I didn't mean to.",2024-09-03 21:33:44
12557,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,But we were almost done! Now we have to start from scratch.,2024-09-03 21:37:44
12558,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm really sorry. Let’s figure out how to fix this together.",2024-09-03 21:45:44
12559,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,"Hey, guys, I just heard about the file. Maybe we can check if there's a backup somewhere?",2024-09-03 21:49:44
12560,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,"We might have a backup from last week, but that's still a lot of work lost.",2024-09-03 21:56:44
12561,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"If we all work together, we can catch up faster. I'll redo the sections I was working on.",2024-09-03 22:00:44
12562,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,"Alright, I guess blaming you won't help. We don't have much time.",2024-09-03 22:09:44
12563,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,I can focus on getting the latest data back in. Let's split the workload logically.,2024-09-03 22:16:44
12564,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,"Good idea. Mark, you should handle the complex parts since you're the best at them.",2024-09-03 22:21:44
12565,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,"Fine, I'll take care of that. Let's make a checklist so we stay organized.",2024-09-03 22:24:44
12566,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,"I'll draft the checklist. Sarah, can you start on the introduction and summary parts?",2024-09-03 22:29:44
12567,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's keep each other updated on our progress.,2024-09-03 22:30:44
12568,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks for stepping up, everyone. Let's get back on track.",2024-09-03 22:34:44
12569,deescalatory_conversation_297,speaker_3,We’ve got this. Let’s show them what we can do,2024-09-03 22:41:44
12570,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up to the group meeting, Jenna. We really needed your input!",2024-09-03 21:31:48
12571,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Mark. I was caught up with another project and lost track of time.",2024-09-03 21:41:48
12572,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,But we all agreed that this was a priority. It's not fair to the rest of us putting in the work.,2024-09-03 21:51:48
12573,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"I know, I'm really sorry. How can I make it up to you all?",2024-09-03 21:56:48
12574,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,"Well, for starters, you could help us finish the report by tomorrow. We're behind schedule because of this.",2024-09-03 21:57:48
12575,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,I can do that. I'll stay late tonight to make sure we get it done on time.,2024-09-03 22:05:48
12576,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_3,"Jenna, if you need any additional resources or help, let me know. We're all in this together.",2024-09-03 22:08:48
12577,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"Thanks, Emily. I really appreciate that.",2024-09-03 22:16:48
12578,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_1,"Let's aim to communicate better next time. If anyone's going to be late or miss a meeting, we need to know ahead of time.",2024-09-03 22:21:48
12579,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_2,"Agreed, Mark. I'll set reminders and make sure it doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:28:48
12580,deescalatory_conversation_298,speaker_3,"Thanks, everyone. Let's finish this strong and hand in a great report.",2024-09-03 22:33:48
12581,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the last play?,2024-09-03 21:32:52
12582,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, and I thought taking the shot myself would be better.",2024-09-03 21:36:52
12583,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"But I was right there, you had to have seen me!",2024-09-03 21:39:52
12584,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,Maybe I missed it in the heat of the moment. Let's figure out a way to improve our communication.,2024-09-03 21:43:52
12585,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"Fine, but we can't keep missing these opportunities. We need to win the next game.",2024-09-03 21:47:52
12586,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,Agreed. How about we practice some specific signals so we know when we're open?,2024-09-03 21:52:52
12587,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"Yeah, that could work. We need to be on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:55:52
12588,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"Also, I'll make sure to scan the court better before making a decision. Can you do the same?",2024-09-03 22:05:52
12589,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,Definitely. And I'll call out more loudly so you can't miss me.,2024-09-03 22:15:52
12590,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"Good plan. Let's sync up with the rest of the team too, so everyone knows the signals.",2024-09-03 22:21:52
12591,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,"Right, we need everyone to be involved in this.",2024-09-03 22:23:52
12592,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,I'll talk to the coach about setting up a practice session for this.,2024-09-03 22:29:52
12593,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate you being open to fixing this.,2024-09-03 22:38:52
12594,deescalatory_conversation_299,speaker_2,"No problem. We're a team, and we need to work together if we want to win.",2024-09-03 22:47:52
12595,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,Why did you start redesigning the website without consulting the rest of the team?,2024-09-03 21:33:55
12596,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,I thought it was best to take initiative since we were falling behind schedule.,2024-09-03 21:36:55
12597,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"We had a plan, though. Deviating from it just causes confusion.",2024-09-03 21:39:55
12598,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,I understand. I just wanted to add a more user-friendly interface. Did you have specific areas you felt needed more input?,2024-09-03 21:42:55
12599,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"Yes, particularly on how the new layout affects our content placement. Can we review those sections together?",2024-09-03 21:48:55
12600,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,Absolutely. I can show you what I’ve done and we can make adjustments from there.,2024-09-03 21:53:55
12601,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,"Great. Also, let’s create a protocol for major changes like this in the future. Agreed?",2024-09-03 21:56:55
12602,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,Agreed. I should’ve checked in before making big changes.,2024-09-03 22:02:55
12603,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,It’s okay. Let’s focus on optimizing what we have now.,2024-09-03 22:03:55
12604,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan. Thank you for being open to discussing this.,2024-09-03 22:07:55
12605,deescalatory_conversation_300,speaker_1,No problem. Communication is key for our project’s success.,2024-09-03 22:16:55
12606,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,"Jacob, I told you we all needed to turn in our sections of the project by Friday. Why didn't you submit yours?",2024-09-03 21:33:59
12607,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"I had a lot going on this week, Sarah. I just couldn't get around to it.",2024-09-03 21:35:59
12608,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_3,"We can't keep making excuses, Jacob. This affects our whole grade.",2024-09-03 21:38:59
12609,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"I know, Emily. I'm sorry, but I really didn't have the time.",2024-09-03 21:46:59
12610,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,Can you at least tell us what you have done so far?,2024-09-03 21:50:59
12611,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,"I managed to get some research done, but I haven't started writing yet.",2024-09-03 21:59:59
12612,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_3,"If you need help, you should have said something. We could've figured something out together.",2024-09-03 22:04:59
12613,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,I didn't want to bother you guys. You seemed busy with your own sections.,2024-09-03 22:14:59
12614,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,"It's not about bothering us. We're a team, and we need to support each other.",2024-09-03 22:19:59
12615,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,You're right. I should've reached out.,2024-09-03 22:26:59
12616,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_3,How about this: let's set up a time tonight to go over what you've got and organize a plan to finish it.,2024-09-03 22:27:59
12617,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,That would be great. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:34:59
12618,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_1,Let's make sure we communicate better moving forward. We all want this project to succeed.,2024-09-03 22:40:59
12619,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll do my part and keep you updated from now on.,2024-09-03 22:46:59
12620,deescalatory_conversation_301,speaker_3,Perfect. Let's meet at 7 PM online. Sound,2024-09-03 22:52:59
12621,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"Why did you skip practice again, Jamie?",2024-09-03 21:37:03
12622,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework, Coach.",2024-09-03 21:43:03
12623,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"You know skipping practice affects the whole team, right?",2024-09-03 21:49:03
12624,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,"I understand, but I was really overwhelmed.",2024-09-03 21:58:03
12625,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"We've talked about balancing school and sports before, haven't we?",2024-09-03 22:05:03
12626,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,"Yes, but this week was particularly hard.",2024-09-03 22:08:03
12627,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,Can you tell me what made it harder this week?,2024-09-03 22:18:03
12628,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,I had a huge project in history and two tests.,2024-09-03 22:25:03
12629,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,That sounds tough. Have you talked to your teachers about this?,2024-09-03 22:27:03
12630,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,Not really. I didn't think they would care.,2024-09-03 22:31:03
12631,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,They might be more understanding than you think. Would you feel comfortable discussing it with them?,2024-09-03 22:38:03
12632,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,I guess I could try. What do you suggest I say?,2024-09-03 22:45:03
12633,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,Explain your situation honestly and ask if there's any flexibility.,2024-09-03 22:47:03
12634,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,"Okay, I can do that. But what about the team?",2024-09-03 22:48:03
12635,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"It's important to be here, but I understand the need to balance things. Let's work on a plan together.",2024-09-03 22:54:03
12636,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_2,"That would help. Thank you, Coach.",2024-09-03 22:57:03
12637,deescalatory_conversation_302,speaker_1,"No problem, Jamie. We're a team, on and off the field.",2024-09-03 23:02:03
12638,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,I can't believe you told Coach that I was the one who messed up the play.,2024-09-03 21:31:06
12639,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to blame you, I just pointed out that we were out of position.",2024-09-03 21:32:06
12640,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,But you know I wasn't the only one out of position. Why single me out?,2024-09-03 21:33:06
12641,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"You're right, I shouldn't have singled you out. We were all a bit lost during that play.",2024-09-03 21:39:06
12642,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,"Okay, but it really looked like you were trying to make me the scapegoat.",2024-09-03 21:45:06
12643,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"I get how it could seem that way. I was frustrated, and I took it out on you. I'm sorry.",2024-09-03 21:49:06
12644,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let's just try to communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 21:58:06
12645,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,"Agreed. Teamwork is crucial, especially in tight games like these.",2024-09-03 22:02:06
12646,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,"Exactly. If we split apart, we'll never win. We need to support each other.",2024-09-03 22:12:06
12647,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's make sure we're on the same page for the next practice.,2024-09-03 22:21:06
12648,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let's learn from this and come back stronger.,2024-09-03 22:31:06
12649,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_2,For sure. Let's make this a turning point for the team.,2024-09-03 22:39:06
12650,deescalatory_conversation_303,speaker_1,I'm with you. We'll get through this together.,2024-09-03 22:44:06
12651,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,"I really don't understand why you didn't pass me the ball, Jenny.",2024-09-03 21:36:10
12652,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,"Because, Alex, you were completely out of position and it didn't make sense at the time.",2024-09-03 21:46:10
12653,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,But you can't just ignore me the entire game!,2024-09-03 21:47:10
12654,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,I'm not ignoring you. I'm trying to make the best plays for the team.,2024-09-03 21:53:10
12655,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,We’re a team! You can't just decide everything by yourself.,2024-09-03 21:59:10
12656,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry if it felt that way. Let's talk about how we can improve our communication on the court.",2024-09-03 22:00:10
12657,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,Fine. I just think it'd help if we had a better strategy for passing.,2024-09-03 22:02:10
12658,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,Agreed. Maybe we should work on some specific plays during practice.,2024-09-03 22:12:10
12659,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,That sounds good. Can we also discuss positioning so I know where to be?,2024-09-03 22:16:10
12660,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's set some time after practice tomorrow to go over it.,2024-09-03 22:19:10
12661,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jenny. I feel better about this already.",2024-09-03 22:26:10
12662,deescalatory_conversation_304,speaker_2,"No problem, Alex. We're all in this together.",2024-09-03 22:29:10
12663,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you take credit for my part of the project?",2024-09-03 21:33:13
12664,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,"I didn't, I just presented it because you weren't there.",2024-09-03 21:43:13
12665,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,But you didn't mention that I helped at all.,2024-09-03 21:51:13
12666,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,I thought it was understood that you were involved since we worked on it together.,2024-09-03 22:01:13
12667,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,It didn't sound that way. It sounded like you did everything yourself.,2024-09-03 22:04:13
12668,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,I'm sorry if it came across like that. I honestly didn't mean to.,2024-09-03 22:14:13
12669,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,How can I believe that? You've taken credit for my work before.,2024-09-03 22:21:13
12670,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,"I admit I was wrong then, but this time was different. I didn't mean to exclude you.",2024-09-03 22:22:13
12671,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,I just feel unappreciated. I put so much time into that project.,2024-09-03 22:28:13
12672,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,"I get that. You did a lot of work, and it should be recognized. How can I make this right?",2024-09-03 22:30:13
12673,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,Maybe you could talk to the supervisor and set the record straight?,2024-09-03 22:31:13
12674,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,I can do that. I'll make sure they know how much you contributed.,2024-09-03 22:35:13
12675,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,Thanks. That would mean a lot to me.,2024-09-03 22:39:13
12676,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,No problem. We should both get the credit we deserve. Let's work together on this.,2024-09-03 22:47:13
12677,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_1,"Agreed. Next time, let's communicate better before the presentation.",2024-09-03 22:51:13
12678,deescalatory_conversation_305,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's make sure we both know how things will,2024-09-03 22:54:13
12679,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't tell me you already finished the project report, Jeremy.",2024-09-03 21:32:15
12680,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Michelle. I didn't think it mattered since we were both working on different sections.",2024-09-03 21:39:15
12681,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,It does matter! We agreed to review everything together before submission.,2024-09-03 21:43:15
12682,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"You're right, we did. I should have communicated better. What can we do now?",2024-09-03 21:53:15
12683,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"We can still look through it together and make any necessary changes. But next time, let's stay on the same page, okay?",2024-09-03 21:55:15
12684,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I agree. Let's review it now and ensure it's perfect.",2024-09-03 21:58:15
12685,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jeremy. I appreciate your willingness to fix this together.",2024-09-03 22:03:15
12686,deescalatory_conversation_306,speaker_2,"No problem, Michelle. Teamwork is key. Let's get to it.",2024-09-03 22:07:15
12687,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the last quarter? We could've scored!,2024-09-03 21:28:19
12688,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open! Besides, you missed a few shots earlier.",2024-09-03 21:32:19
12689,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,"Just because I missed earlier doesn't mean I can't make another shot. We're a team, remember?",2024-09-03 21:37:19
12690,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,"Yeah, but I was trying to make the best decision at the moment. It wasn't personal.",2024-09-03 21:39:19
12691,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,It felt like you didn't trust me. We need to work on our communication out there.,2024-09-03 21:44:19
12692,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,Maybe you're right. We haven’t been talking enough on the court. Let's figure out a way to signal each other better.,2024-09-03 21:50:19
12693,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,Agreed. How about we set up some hand signals during practice?,2024-09-03 21:55:19
12694,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,That sounds like a plan. And I'll make sure to look for you more often. Let's not let this happen again.,2024-09-03 21:59:19
12695,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_1,Thanks. I’ll work on making myself more visible too. We can win this together.,2024-09-03 22:03:19
12696,deescalatory_conversation_307,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let’s focus on that teamwork. We’re stronger when we work as one.,2024-09-03 22:11:19
12697,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,I don't understand why you won't pass the ball to me during games.,2024-09-03 21:34:22
12698,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,It's not like I'm ignoring you on purpose.,2024-09-03 21:35:22
12699,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,It feels like you don't trust me to make a good play.,2024-09-03 21:42:22
12700,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,Maybe I just think I have a better chance of scoring.,2024-09-03 21:43:22
12701,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_3,"Hey guys, can we talk about this calmly?",2024-09-03 21:49:22
12702,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,"I’m just frustrated. I want us to win, but I don’t feel like a part of the team.",2024-09-03 21:56:22
12703,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,I get it. Maybe I should look for you more often during plays.,2024-09-03 21:58:22
12704,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_3,Let's practice some passing drills together to build trust.,2024-09-03 22:08:22
12705,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I want to prove I can help us win.,2024-09-03 22:17:22
12706,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,And I need to work on trusting you more. We're in this together.,2024-09-03 22:19:22
12707,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_3,"Great, let's start fresh and focus on improving as a team.",2024-09-03 22:27:22
12708,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_1,Thanks for hearing me out.,2024-09-03 22:30:22
12709,deescalatory_conversation_308,speaker_2,And thanks for bringing it up. Let's do this!,2024-09-03 22:36:22
12710,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,"Jake, why didn't you pass the ball to me? I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:34:25
12711,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Sarah, I didn't see you! I was trying to keep us from losing possession.",2024-09-03 21:39:25
12712,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,But you didn't even look my way. This team works only if we play as a team.,2024-09-03 21:46:25
12713,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"You're right, Sarah. I should have been more aware of everyone on the court.",2024-09-03 21:48:25
12714,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,"Guys, let's refocus here. We're all feeling the pressure to win, but arguing won't help.",2024-09-03 21:55:25
12715,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,"Sorry, Coach. I just know we can do better if we communicate.",2024-09-03 22:03:25
12716,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"And I need to do my part to make sure everyone is involved. Thanks for calling us out, Coach.",2024-09-03 22:04:25
12717,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,No problem. Let's use this as a learning moment and work on our passes next practice.,2024-09-03 22:12:25
12718,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,"Agreed. And Jake, let's come up with some signals so we can be more synced.",2024-09-03 22:17:25
12719,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Sounds good. I'll make sure to keep an eye out for you, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:27:25
12720,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_3,Perfect. Let's get back out there and show them what teamwork looks like!,2024-09-03 22:30:25
12721,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_1,Let's do it!,2024-09-03 22:40:25
12722,deescalatory_conversation_309,speaker_2,"Yeah, we got this!",2024-09-03 22:47:25
12723,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,"Look, you didn't even show up for the group project meeting yesterday.",2024-09-03 21:33:29
12724,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,I already told you I had a family emergency. I couldn't be there.,2024-09-03 21:38:29
12725,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,But you didn't even inform us! How are we supposed to know?,2024-09-03 21:47:29
12726,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,You're right. I should've let you know earlier. My bad.,2024-09-03 21:49:29
12727,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,"Okay, so what are we going to do about the presentation now?",2024-09-03 21:56:29
12728,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,Let's divide the tasks we have left. I'll take on some extra parts to make up for missing the meeting.,2024-09-03 22:04:29
12729,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,"Alright, I appreciate that. We need to finalize the slides and practice our parts.",2024-09-03 22:14:29
12730,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,I can work on the slides tonight. Can we meet tomorrow to rehearse?,2024-09-03 22:24:29
12731,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,That works. Just make sure everything is updated by tomorrow afternoon.,2024-09-03 22:25:29
12732,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll send you the draft as soon as it's ready.,2024-09-03 22:35:29
12733,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_1,And let's remember to communicate better going forward.,2024-09-03 22:41:29
12734,deescalatory_conversation_310,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for understanding. Let's nail this presentation.,2024-09-03 22:45:29
12735,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball. We had a clear shot!,2024-09-03 21:33:32
12736,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,"You were too far out, and I thought it was better to dribble in.",2024-09-03 21:43:32
12737,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,We have a game plan for a reason! Why didn't you stick to it?,2024-09-03 21:47:32
12738,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,"Okay, point taken, but I didn't hear you calling for it either.",2024-09-03 21:49:32
12739,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing isn't helping. We need to figure out how to fix this for the next play.",2024-09-03 21:56:32
12740,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,"Fine. What do you think went wrong, then?",2024-09-03 21:58:32
12741,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,I think we weren't communicating well enough on the field.,2024-09-03 22:03:32
12742,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_3,"Agreed. How about during timeouts, we make it a point to review positioning and who should have the ball?",2024-09-03 22:06:32
12743,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,That makes sense. I guess I should have been louder.,2024-09-03 22:08:32
12744,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,And I'll look up more to see where everyone is before making a move.,2024-09-03 22:11:32
12745,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_3,Perfect. Let's focus on keeping our heads up and talking more.,2024-09-03 22:16:32
12746,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_1,"Alright, let's try that next time. No hard feelings?",2024-09-03 22:24:32
12747,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_2,No hard feelings. We're a team.,2024-09-03 22:28:32
12748,deescalatory_conversation_311,speaker_3,Good. Let's get back out there and win this.,2024-09-03 22:32:32
12749,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took credit for the group project, John. We all worked hard on it.",2024-09-03 21:31:36
12750,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to take all the credit, Anne. I just summarized our work during the presentation.",2024-09-03 21:33:36
12751,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,But you didn't mention any of our contributions! It's like we didn't do anything.,2024-09-03 21:42:36
12752,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have highlighted everyone's part. I was nervous and it slipped my mind. I'm sorry.",2024-09-03 21:44:36
12753,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_3,"Yeah, John, it felt like we were just there for moral support.",2024-09-03 21:46:36
12754,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"I understand, Maria. I messed up. How can I make it right?",2024-09-03 21:55:36
12755,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,"Maybe you could send an email to the professor, explaining everyone's contributions?",2024-09-03 21:57:36
12756,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'll write the email and show it to you all before sending it.,2024-09-03 22:05:36
12757,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_3,"And next time, we should agree on who's saying what in advance.",2024-09-03 22:14:36
12758,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's make a better plan next time to avoid this happening again.,2024-09-03 22:17:36
12759,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_1,"Thanks, John. It means a lot that you're willing to fix this.",2024-09-03 22:24:36
12760,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,"No problem, Anne. We all deserve recognition for our hard work.",2024-09-03 22:34:36
12761,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_3,"Alright, let's move on and make our project even better next time.",2024-09-03 22:40:36
12762,deescalatory_conversation_312,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's give it our best shot!,2024-09-03 22:44:36
12763,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just left the presentation halfway, Anna. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:30:39
12764,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"John, I didn't mean to leave you hanging. Something urgent came up.",2024-09-03 21:38:39
12765,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,But you could've at least told me! I was left to answer all the questions by myself.,2024-09-03 21:42:39
12766,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. It was unprofessional of me. What can I do to make it right?",2024-09-03 21:50:39
12767,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,Maybe explain what was so urgent that you couldn't give me a heads-up?,2024-09-03 21:55:39
12768,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,My sister called; she's been having a rough time and needed my help immediately. I didn't think it through.,2024-09-03 22:00:39
12769,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,"Family emergencies are important, but work commitments are too. We need to find a balance.",2024-09-03 22:01:39
12770,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,"You're right, John. Next time I'll make sure to better coordinate in such situations. Would you be willing to go over the feedback with me so we can improve for next time?",2024-09-03 22:04:39
12771,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. Let's set some clear guidelines for communicating emergencies.,2024-09-03 22:05:39
12772,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_2,Absolutely. And I'll draft an email to the team explaining what happened and how we'll handle it in the future.,2024-09-03 22:13:39
12773,deescalatory_conversation_313,speaker_1,Great. Let's turn this situation into a learning opportunity for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:21:39
12774,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead and changed the project outline without consulting me, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:29:43
12775,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,"I thought it would improve our chances of getting a better grade, Sam. You were taking too long to decide.",2024-09-03 21:30:43
12776,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,We are supposed to work as a team. Making big decisions like that on your own isn't fair.,2024-09-03 21:31:43
12777,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,"I understand why you're upset, and I didn't mean to sideline you. I just thought quick action was necessary.",2024-09-03 21:36:43
12778,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,Why didn't you just message me or wait until our next meeting?,2024-09-03 21:42:43
12779,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,"My bad, I should have considered your input more. Can we review it together now and make any adjustments?",2024-09-03 21:51:43
12780,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's go through the changes and see if we can agree on something. I just want us to be on the same page.",2024-09-03 21:57:43
12781,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,"Agreed, let's collaborate on it this time and make sure both our ideas are included.",2024-09-03 22:04:43
12782,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_1,"Okay, let's start with the new introduction. How do you feel about combining it with parts of the original?",2024-09-03 22:05:43
12783,deescalatory_conversation_314,speaker_2,That sounds like a good compromise. Let's blend the best elements from both versions.,2024-09-03 22:09:43
12784,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted the final project without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:28:45
12785,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but we were running out of time, and I didn't want to risk us missing the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:36:45
12786,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,"Still, it feels like you didn't trust me to do my part.",2024-09-03 21:38:45
12787,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,It's not about trust. I was just trying to ensure we didn't fail because of time management issues.,2024-09-03 21:39:45
12788,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,"I understand the urgency, but we could've talked about it together and done a final review.",2024-09-03 21:49:45
12789,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,You're right. I should've communicated better about what I was planning to do.,2024-09-03 21:58:45
12790,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,"Next time, let's agree to always discuss final decisions as a team.",2024-09-03 22:06:45
12791,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,"Agreed. We both bring valuable perspectives to the table, and I don't want you to feel left out again.",2024-09-03 22:16:45
12792,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's focus on acing the presentation now.,2024-09-03 22:22:45
12793,deescalatory_conversation_315,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's make sure we knock it out of the park.",2024-09-03 22:28:45
12794,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you pick me up from school today? You knew I had to stay late for practice.",2024-09-03 21:30:49
12795,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"I got caught up with some work. I really tried, but things got hectic.",2024-09-03 21:36:49
12796,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,You should've at least called or texted. I was standing there like an idiot!,2024-09-03 21:41:49
12797,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"You're right, I should've communicated better. I'm really sorry about that.",2024-09-03 21:51:49
12798,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,It's just frustrating. I had to walk home in the rain.,2024-09-03 21:58:49
12799,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"I understand why you're upset. Next time, I'll make sure to let you know if something comes up.",2024-09-03 22:00:49
12800,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"Fine, just don't forget about me again.",2024-09-03 22:03:49
12801,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,"I won’t. Your practice is important, and I don't want to let you down.",2024-09-03 22:10:49
12802,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate you saying that.,2024-09-03 22:15:49
12803,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,Of course. Let’s figure out a backup plan in case this happens again.,2024-09-03 22:20:49
12804,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,"Yeah, maybe I can call a friend or something.",2024-09-03 22:25:49
12805,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. Let's make sure both of us keep in touch better.,2024-09-03 22:35:49
12806,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_1,Deal. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:45:49
12807,deescalatory_conversation_316,speaker_2,Anytime. We'll get through it together.,2024-09-03 22:48:49
12808,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,"Why did you take the last piece of cake without asking, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:37:52
12809,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,I didn’t know I had to ask for permission every time I wanted something.,2024-09-03 21:45:52
12810,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,"It’s not about permission, it’s about being considerate of everyone else.",2024-09-03 21:55:52
12811,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,"Okay, I get that. But you also could have told me there were rules about the cake.",2024-09-03 22:02:52
12812,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,"It’s just common courtesy, Sam.",2024-09-03 22:04:52
12813,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,I understand now. Maybe we should come up with some clear guidelines for next time.,2024-09-03 22:11:52
12814,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,"That sounds fair. Also, letting everyone know when something is finished can avoid misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 22:13:52
12815,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll make sure to check in before taking the last of anything from now on.,2024-09-03 22:17:52
12816,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sam. Communication will definitely help us avoid future conflicts.",2024-09-03 22:23:52
12817,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,"Yeah, I don’t want us to keep having these types of arguments.",2024-09-03 22:30:52
12818,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_1,Same. It’s better if we work together on these small things.,2024-09-03 22:34:52
12819,deescalatory_conversation_317,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’ll do my part.,2024-09-03 22:43:52
12820,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up to the presentation today?,2024-09-03 21:35:56
12821,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,"I didn't think my part was ready, and I didn't want to bring the team down.",2024-09-03 21:37:56
12822,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,But you didn't tell anyone you weren't going to be there. We were all counting on you.,2024-09-03 21:45:56
12823,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm really sorry. I should have communicated that I was struggling.",2024-09-03 21:50:56
12824,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,It would have helped. We could have adjusted the plan or supported you more.,2024-09-03 21:56:56
12825,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,You're right. I felt embarrassed and didn't know how to ask for help.,2024-09-03 21:58:56
12826,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,"I get that, but moving forward, we need to trust each other and be open about issues.",2024-09-03 22:02:56
12827,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,Absolutely. I promise to be more upfront next time.,2024-09-03 22:03:56
12828,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,"Thanks. And if you need more time or assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.",2024-09-03 22:07:56
12829,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,I will. Can we meet later to go over the presentation so I can improve my part?,2024-09-03 22:13:56
12830,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,"Yes, that sounds like a good idea. Let's set up a time this afternoon.",2024-09-03 22:17:56
12831,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,Great. Thanks for understanding. I really appreciate it.,2024-09-03 22:19:56
12832,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,"No problem. We're a team, and we're here to support each other.",2024-09-03 22:21:56
12833,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_2,Exactly. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again. Let's make the next presentation our best one yet.,2024-09-03 22:26:56
12834,deescalatory_conversation_318,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's do it together.,2024-09-03 22:36:56
12835,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"Alex, why didn't you tell me you missed the project deadline?",2024-09-03 21:32:59
12836,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"I was embarrassed, Sara. I thought I could fix it before anyone noticed.",2024-09-03 21:37:59
12837,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"We're a team, Alex. Hiding things only makes it worse for all of us.",2024-09-03 21:44:59
12838,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"I know, I'm sorry. I didn't want to drag everyone else down because of my mistake.",2024-09-03 21:48:59
12839,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"It's not about blame, it's about finding a solution together. What happened exactly? Why did you miss the deadline?",2024-09-03 21:53:59
12840,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"I misjudged how long the final report would take. And honestly, I was overwhelmed by the other tasks we've got.",2024-09-03 21:57:59
12841,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"Okay, that makes sense. I think we need to reassess how we allocate tasks. But we also need to let the client know about the delay. How should we handle that?",2024-09-03 22:06:59
12842,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,Maybe we can explain honestly that we hit an unexpected snag and offer a new timeline?,2024-09-03 22:10:59
12843,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"That sounds reasonable. We should also show we've made progress, so they see we're committed to finishing it. Can you draft the email? I'll review it.",2024-09-03 22:17:59
12844,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"Sure, I'll work on that. And maybe we can have a meeting to redistribute some of the workload?",2024-09-03 22:20:59
12845,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_1,"Absolutely, we'll do that. Let’s make sure we stay in better communication moving forward, okay?",2024-09-03 22:28:59
12846,deescalatory_conversation_319,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for understanding, Sara. I'll get started",2024-09-03 22:32:59
12847,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the project without telling me, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:31:04
12848,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"It was due, Lisa. What else was I supposed to do? You weren't responding to my texts.",2024-09-03 21:41:04
12849,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,Because I was finalizing the last section! We agreed to review everything together before submitting.,2024-09-03 21:43:04
12850,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. I just panicked because the deadline was so close. Did you submit a different version afterward?",2024-09-03 21:50:04
12851,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,"No, I thought it was too late once you submitted it. Did you even check my part for errors?",2024-09-03 21:51:04
12852,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"I did look it over, but maybe not as thoroughly as I should have. What do you think still needs fixing?",2024-09-03 22:00:04
12853,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,There's a whole paragraph that doesn't flow well. And some of the data points in the analysis were outdated.,2024-09-03 22:05:04
12854,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. We're both stressed about this. Is there any way we can email the professor to request a revision?",2024-09-03 22:11:04
12855,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,We might be able to if we explain the situation. But you have to admit we need better communication next time.,2024-09-03 22:14:04
12856,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,Absolutely. I promise to check in more frequently. Should we draft that email together now?,2024-09-03 22:24:04
12857,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_1,"Yes, let's do it. And let's make sure we include the updates we each have so we can present a stronger version.",2024-09-03 22:25:04
12858,deescalatory_conversation_320,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'll start writing, and you can add",2024-09-03 22:26:04
12859,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't turn in the project on time, Alex. We agreed on a deadline!",2024-09-03 21:34:07
12860,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"I know, Sarah. I'm really sorry. I got caught up with family issues. It won't happen again.",2024-09-03 21:44:07
12861,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,Family issues? You could have at least let me know. We were counting on you.,2024-09-03 21:51:07
12862,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,"You're right, Sarah. I should have communicated better. Is there any way I can make it up to the team?",2024-09-03 21:59:07
12863,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_3,"Maybe if we all work together, we can still salvage the project. Alex, if you handle the research, Sarah can handle the presentation part.",2024-09-03 22:05:07
12864,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,"That sounds like a reasonable plan. What do you think, Alex?",2024-09-03 22:13:07
12865,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,That works for me. I'll start on the research right away and keep everyone updated.,2024-09-03 22:21:07
12866,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_4,"I can help with the data analysis if you need, Alex. We still have a chance to turn this around.",2024-09-03 22:28:07
12867,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_1,"Thank you, everyone. Let's make sure we keep the communication channels open this time. We can do this.",2024-09-03 22:35:07
12868,deescalatory_conversation_321,speaker_2,Agreed. I won't let you down again. Let's get this done.,2024-09-03 22:36:07
12869,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you change the presentation slides without telling me?",2024-09-03 21:30:10
12870,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,I thought the new design would be more effective for our audience.,2024-09-03 21:31:10
12871,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,But you didn't even ask for my opinion. We’re supposed to be working on this together.,2024-09-03 21:33:10
12872,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,You're right. I should have consulted you before making changes. What do you think of the new design?,2024-09-03 21:35:10
12873,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"It looks good, but I had some points to add to those slides. Now I need to find a way to fit them in.",2024-09-03 21:45:10
12874,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,I understand. Let's go through your points now and see how we can incorporate them.,2024-09-03 21:50:10
12875,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate that. I think the section on market trends needs more detail.,2024-09-03 21:56:10
12876,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,"Okay, let’s add those details. Do you have specific data you want to include?",2024-09-03 21:59:10
12877,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"Yes, I have some statistics from our recent survey. I think it will strengthen our argument.",2024-09-03 22:04:10
12878,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,"Great, let’s update the slide with that information. Should we also discuss how to present this together?",2024-09-03 22:05:10
12879,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,Absolutely. We need to make sure we’re both comfortable with the final presentation.,2024-09-03 22:09:10
12880,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll make sure to check in with you next time before making any changes. Sorry for the oversight.,2024-09-03 22:17:10
12881,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Let’s finish this up and run through it once more together.",2024-09-03 22:24:10
12882,deescalatory_conversation_322,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:32:10
12883,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball in the last few minutes of the game?,2024-09-03 21:30:14
12884,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, and I thought I had a better shot.",2024-09-03 21:34:14
12885,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,But I've been in better form all week; you know that.,2024-09-03 21:39:14
12886,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,"I understand, but in that moment, I felt like taking the shot was the best option.",2024-09-03 21:47:14
12887,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,Couldn't you have at least looked for me instead of rushing it?,2024-09-03 21:49:14
12888,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,"I guess I could have, but the clock was ticking, and I panicked a bit.",2024-09-03 21:55:14
12889,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,We're a team; we need to trust each other out there.,2024-09-03 22:02:14
12890,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,"You're right. I should have trusted you more. Next time, I'll be more aware.",2024-09-03 22:07:14
12891,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's work on our communication during practice.,2024-09-03 22:13:14
12892,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,Agreed. We need to improve so we avoid these situations in the future.,2024-09-03 22:20:14
12893,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_3,"Hey, I overheard you both. Maybe we can set up some extra drills to work on passes and teamwork?",2024-09-03 22:23:14
12894,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea.,2024-09-03 22:30:14
12895,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,Definitely. Let's get the whole team involved so we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:37:14
12896,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_3,Sounds good. Let's talk to the coach about adding it to our routine.,2024-09-03 22:45:14
12897,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_1,"I feel better about this already. Thanks for listening, both of you.",2024-09-03 22:47:14
12898,deescalatory_conversation_323,speaker_2,No problem. We're all in this together,2024-09-03 22:56:14
12899,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,I can't believe you shared my idea with the whole team without even asking me first.,2024-09-03 21:33:18
12900,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was that big of a deal. We’re all working towards the same goal, right?",2024-09-03 21:42:18
12901,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,"Yes, but it was my work and I wanted to present it in my own way.",2024-09-03 21:49:18
12902,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,I see your point. I apologize for not consulting you first. How can we fix this moving forward?,2024-09-03 21:56:18
12903,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,Maybe we can set some ground rules about how we share each other's work?,2024-09-03 22:00:18
12904,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,That sounds fair. What kind of rules do you think would work?,2024-09-03 22:05:18
12905,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,"For starters, we could always ask for permission before sharing someone else's ideas or work.",2024-09-03 22:10:18
12906,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,Agreed. Can we also state how we want our work to be attributed when shared?,2024-09-03 22:16:18
12907,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,"Definitely, and maybe we should have regular check-ins to ensure everyone is comfortable with how things are being handled.",2024-09-03 22:18:18
12908,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,I can support that. It seems like open communication is key here.,2024-09-03 22:24:18
12909,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,"Yes, open communication is crucial. I appreciate you being willing to talk this through.",2024-09-03 22:28:18
12910,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,No problem. I value our teamwork and I want to make sure everyone feels respected.,2024-09-03 22:31:18
12911,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_1,Thanks. I feel better about our collaboration now. Let's move forward with these new guidelines.,2024-09-03 22:38:18
12912,deescalatory_conversation_324,speaker_2,Agreed. I'm looking forward to seeing how we can make this project,2024-09-03 22:39:18
12913,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,"Why did you borrow my lab notes without asking, Alex? I needed them for my study session.",2024-09-03 21:34:21
12914,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,"I’m really sorry, Emma. I was in a bind and thought you wouldn’t mind since we’re partners for the project.",2024-09-03 21:41:21
12915,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,I do mind! Now my study plan is ruined. Couldn’t you have made a copy instead?,2024-09-03 21:45:21
12916,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,I didn’t think of that at the time. I see how it was inconsiderate of me. How can I make it up to you?,2024-09-03 21:47:21
12917,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,"You could help me by sharing the notes you took so I can catch up. And next time, please just ask.",2024-09-03 21:50:21
12918,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I’ll share everything I have. And I promise I’ll ask in the future instead of assuming.",2024-09-03 21:56:21
12919,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate it. Let's try to communicate better next time. We need to work together to ace this project.",2024-09-03 22:00:21
12920,deescalatory_conversation_325,speaker_2,You’re right. Better communication from now on. Let’s focus on getting this project done well.,2024-09-03 22:01:21
12921,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"Tom, you borrowed my bike again without asking. This has to stop.",2024-09-03 21:31:24
12922,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"Sarah, I really needed it to get to work on time. I didn't think it would be a big deal just this once.",2024-09-03 21:32:24
12923,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"It's not about ""just this once,"" Tom. This is the third time this month.",2024-09-03 21:36:24
12924,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"I get that you're upset, but my car broke down. I had no other way to get there.",2024-09-03 21:38:24
12925,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"I understand emergencies happen, but borrowing without asking is the issue here.",2024-09-03 21:45:24
12926,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have asked first. How can I make it up to you?",2024-09-03 21:46:24
12927,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, Tom. Maybe you can help me with some chores this weekend?",2024-09-03 21:55:24
12928,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I can do that. And I'll make sure to ask next time, no exceptions.",2024-09-03 21:56:24
12929,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_1,"Thanks, that would really help. Let's keep communication open from now on.",2024-09-03 22:04:24
12930,deescalatory_conversation_326,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to respect your things and ask permission in the future.,2024-09-03 22:06:24
12931,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,"I just don't understand why you didn't help with the group project, Tom.",2024-09-03 21:37:28
12932,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,"I had my reasons, Sarah. I was busy with other assignments.",2024-09-03 21:47:28
12933,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,But we all have other assignments. We had agreed on splitting the tasks.,2024-09-03 21:48:28
12934,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,"Maybe I just didn't want to work on what I was assigned, okay?",2024-09-03 21:54:28
12935,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_3,"Guys, this isn't helping. Let's figure out how to move forward instead of pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 22:03:28
12936,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,"Fine, but Tom, you should have communicated with us if you had a problem.",2024-09-03 22:04:28
12937,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,"I get that now. I'm sorry, I just didn't know how to bring it up.",2024-09-03 22:14:28
12938,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_3,How about we reorganize the tasks so everyone has something they can manage?,2024-09-03 22:23:28
12939,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,"That might work. Tom, could you handle the research instead of the presentation?",2024-09-03 22:30:28
12940,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can do that. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:39:28
12941,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_3,"Great, so it's settled. Sarah, you'll handle the presentation and I'll take care of the data analysis?",2024-09-03 22:41:28
12942,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,Works for me. Let's make sure we keep each other updated this time.,2024-09-03 22:45:28
12943,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_2,"Agreed. I'm sorry for the trouble, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:55:28
12944,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_3,"It's okay, Tom. Let's just focus on getting a good grade on this project.",2024-09-03 22:58:28
12945,deescalatory_conversation_327,speaker_1,Agreed. We can still turn this around.,2024-09-03 23:07:28
12946,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't back me up during the presentation, Emma.",2024-09-03 21:29:32
12947,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,"John, I didn't think it was necessary to add more fuel to the fire.",2024-09-03 21:36:32
12948,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,"But you know how hard I worked on that project. It felt like you were just standing by, letting them tear it apart.",2024-09-03 21:40:32
12949,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,I understand you put a lot of effort into it. My intention wasn’t to let them criticize your work unchallenged.,2024-09-03 21:44:32
12950,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,So what was your intention then? Just to watch?,2024-09-03 21:50:32
12951,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,Not at all. I thought staying calm would help diffuse the tension and make it easier for everyone to accept our points.,2024-09-03 21:57:32
12952,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,"Maybe, but it felt like I was alone up there. A little support could have gone a long way.",2024-09-03 22:00:32
12953,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,I see your point. I should have supported you more actively. How do you think we can handle something like this better in the future?,2024-09-03 22:05:32
12954,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,It would help if we had some sort of plan or signals for when we need each other’s support during tough questions.,2024-09-03 22:07:32
12955,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,That’s a good idea. We could definitely come up with a strategy together.,2024-09-03 22:11:32
12956,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_1,"Yeah, I think that would really help. And if you feel I'm too heated, you can step in to calm things down.",2024-09-03 22:12:32
12957,deescalatory_conversation_328,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll work on being more present and vocal when we need to defend our work.,2024-09-03 22:22:32
12958,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and bought the car without consulting me!,2024-09-03 21:32:35
12959,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,I thought we agreed we needed another car. I saw a good deal and took it.,2024-09-03 21:37:35
12960,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_1,But we talked about discussing big purchases first. This wasn't a small decision.,2024-09-03 21:46:35
12961,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,"I understand that, and I'm really sorry. I got carried away when I saw the discount.",2024-09-03 21:56:35
12962,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_1,"It's not just about the discount, though. It's about making decisions together.",2024-09-03 21:58:35
12963,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,You're right. I should have called you before finalizing anything. What can we do now to fix this?,2024-09-03 22:01:35
12964,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_1,"Well, first off, let's sit down tonight and go through the finances to see how this impacts us. Then we can figure out a strategy.",2024-09-03 22:08:35
12965,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,"Great idea. We'll work on it together. And in the future, I'll make sure to consult you before making any big decisions.",2024-09-03 22:12:35
12966,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_1,"I appreciate that. For now, let's focus on making the best out of the situation and how we can integrate this car into our budget.",2024-09-03 22:21:35
12967,deescalatory_conversation_329,speaker_2,"Absolutely, we'll get through this as a team. Thanks for being understanding.",2024-09-03 22:27:35
12968,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't tell me about the project deadline extension.,2024-09-03 21:34:39
12969,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,I didn't think it was a big deal since we were almost done.,2024-09-03 21:40:39
12970,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,But it was a chance for us to refine our work. Why keep it to yourself?,2024-09-03 21:48:39
12971,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,"Honestly, I didn't want to stress anyone out with more changes. We've all been so tired.",2024-09-03 21:50:39
12972,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,"I get that, but sharing information like that is crucial. We could have at least discussed our options.",2024-09-03 21:58:39
12973,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have brought it up. Let's figure out what we need to do now with the extra time.",2024-09-03 22:02:39
12974,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,I think we can add more data to support our conclusions. It'll make our presentation stronger.,2024-09-03 22:07:39
12975,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I'll handle revising the introduction while you work on gathering more data.,2024-09-03 22:15:39
12976,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_1,"Sounds like a plan. Also, if anything like this happens again, let's all agree to share it immediately.",2024-09-03 22:25:39
12977,deescalatory_conversation_330,speaker_2,Agreed. Communication is key. Thanks for bringing this up.,2024-09-03 22:32:39
12978,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,"Tim, you didn't pass me the ball even once during the game. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:34:42
12979,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Jake, I didn't see you open. I was trying to make the best play for the team.",2024-09-03 21:42:42
12980,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,I was open multiple times. It feels like you don't trust me.,2024-09-03 21:43:42
12981,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,It's not about trust. I just have to make quick decisions on the court.,2024-09-03 21:52:42
12982,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_3,"Guys, we're all on the same team. Can we focus on finding a solution?",2024-09-03 22:02:42
12983,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,"Fine. Tim, what do you need from me to feel confident passing the ball?",2024-09-03 22:06:42
12984,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Maybe we need to practice our plays more. If I know where you'll be, I'll feel more comfortable passing.",2024-09-03 22:07:42
12985,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_3,That sounds like a good idea. How about we run some extra drills after practice?,2024-09-03 22:12:42
12986,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,"I'm okay with that. Tim, does that work for you?",2024-09-03 22:17:42
12987,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Yes, I think it will help. I don't want you to think I don't believe in you, Jake.",2024-09-03 22:26:42
12988,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,"Alright, let's work on this together then. We both want to win.",2024-09-03 22:36:42
12989,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for being open about it, Jake.",2024-09-03 22:46:42
12990,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_3,"Great, let's move forward as a stronger unit.",2024-09-03 22:47:42
12991,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let's wrap up practice on a positive note.,2024-09-03 22:53:42
12992,deescalatory_conversation_331,speaker_2,"Yeah, let’s do it.",2024-09-03 23:02:42
12993,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,You seriously think you can just bail on the group project and leave us to do all the work?,2024-09-03 21:38:47
12994,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,"I didn't bail! I had a family emergency, I told you guys about it.",2024-09-03 21:44:47
12995,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_3,"Yeah, we know, but you didn't send us any of your research before leaving. We were stuck doing everything last minute.",2024-09-03 21:45:47
12996,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,"I thought I could handle it, but things got worse. I understand you're upset, but you have to see it from my point of view too.",2024-09-03 21:47:47
12997,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,"Look, we’re not saying your family emergency wasn’t important, but we needed better communication. We could've planned around your absence.",2024-09-03 21:55:47
12998,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,I get it. I should have told you earlier. Maybe we can meet after class to make sure we finish everything together?,2024-09-03 21:56:47
12999,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_3,That sounds better. How about we divvy up the remaining tasks evenly?,2024-09-03 22:00:47
13000,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,"And maybe set up a group chat so if anything comes up, we can respond faster?",2024-09-03 22:10:47
13001,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll make sure to keep you all updated from now on. I’m really sorry for the mess.,2024-09-03 22:13:47
13002,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_3,Apology accepted. Let’s focus on finishing this project strong. We’ve still got time to pull it all together.,2024-09-03 22:16:47
13003,deescalatory_conversation_332,speaker_1,"Exactly. We’re a team; let’s act like one. If we work together, we can make this work.",2024-09-03 22:17:47
13004,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the group project without even telling us.,2024-09-03 21:38:51
13005,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_2,"I had to; the deadline was approaching, and no one else was responding to my messages.",2024-09-03 21:42:51
13006,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_3,But we were supposed to review it together one last time. What if there’s a mistake?,2024-09-03 21:51:51
13007,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_1,Exactly. We could have missed something important that we won't notice until it's too late.,2024-09-03 21:54:51
13008,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but I did this to make sure we didn't lose points for late submission. Are there specific sections you're worried about?",2024-09-03 21:58:51
13009,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_3,"Yeah, I'm not sure if the data analysis part is accurate. I wanted to double-check the calculations.",2024-09-03 22:01:51
13010,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_1,And I was concerned about the conclusion section. I felt it could use more solid arguments to support our findings.,2024-09-03 22:05:51
13011,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_2,I get it. I wish we had more time to go over everything together. Can we agree on what we need to improve if we get a chance to revise?,2024-09-03 22:08:51
13012,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_3,Definitely. Let's start with the data analysis. Do you still have the raw data? We can review the calculations right now.,2024-09-03 22:12:51
13013,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_1,"And after that, we can work on strengthening the conclusion together. Maybe we can add a few more references for credibility.",2024-09-03 22:21:51
13014,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_2,That sounds good. I'll open up the document and we can make the changes as a team. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:28:51
13015,deescalatory_conversation_333,speaker_3,It's okay. Let's just make,2024-09-03 22:33:51
13016,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball, Lisa? We were right on the cusp of scoring!",2024-09-03 21:31:55
13017,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, Sam. I was trying to follow the play we practiced.",2024-09-03 21:34:55
13018,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_1,"The play was clearly falling apart, couldn't you see that? You need to be more adaptable!",2024-09-03 21:43:55
13019,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_2,"Okay, I get that, but shouting at me during the game isn't helping. What can we do differently next time?",2024-09-03 21:51:55
13020,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_1,Maybe we need to call out positions more clearly. I felt like no one knew where they needed to be.,2024-09-03 21:57:55
13021,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_2,Good point. We also need to back each other up if someone misses their mark. How about we practice some of those scenarios?,2024-09-03 22:05:55
13022,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's do that. Can we also work on improving our communication? I feel like there’s a lot of miscommunication on the field.",2024-09-03 22:08:55
13023,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_2,Absolutely. Maybe we can have a quick chat before the game to assign roles more clearly.,2024-09-03 22:13:55
13024,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_1,Agreed. And I'll work on trying to stay calm when things don't go as planned. Sorry for snapping at you.,2024-09-03 22:15:55
13025,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_2,"It's okay, Sam. We're all in this together. Let's just focus on working better as a team.",2024-09-03 22:21:55
13026,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_1,Sounds good to me. Let’s give it our best in the next game!,2024-09-03 22:30:55
13027,deescalatory_conversation_334,speaker_2,Definitely! We'll learn from this and come back stronger.,2024-09-03 22:36:55
13028,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_1,Why did you change the meeting agenda without informing me first?,2024-09-03 21:34:58
13029,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, so I went ahead with it.",2024-09-03 21:39:58
13030,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_1,But it affects everyone's preparations. We all need to be on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:41:58
13031,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_2,I see your point. I didn't consider that. How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 21:44:58
13032,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_1,Maybe we should set up a system where any changes need to be communicated 24 hours in advance?,2024-09-03 21:45:58
13033,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_2,That sounds reasonable. We could also do a quick check-in before making any alterations.,2024-09-03 21:48:58
13034,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_3,I agree with that plan. It keeps everyone in the loop.,2024-09-03 21:58:58
13035,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_1,"Great, so we're all on board with the 24-hour notice and check-ins?",2024-09-03 22:03:58
13036,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_2,"Yes, I'm on board. Thanks for bringing it up constructively.",2024-09-03 22:10:58
13037,deescalatory_conversation_335,speaker_3,Same here. This should improve our communication moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:15:58
13038,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_1,"What were you thinking, Emma? You can't just skip practice whenever you feel like it!",2024-09-03 21:34:02
13039,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_2,"I know, Coach, but I had a huge exam and I needed to study.",2024-09-03 21:42:02
13040,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_1,"I understand school is important, but you should've told me ahead of time.",2024-09-03 21:45:02
13041,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. I just got really overwhelmed.,2024-09-03 21:51:02
13042,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_1,"It's good that you care about your grades, but being part of a team means being accountable to everyone.",2024-09-03 21:58:02
13043,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_2,I do want to be there for the team. Maybe I could set up a study schedule that works around practice times?,2024-09-03 22:04:02
13044,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. Planning ahead will help you manage both responsibilities.,2024-09-03 22:10:02
13045,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_2,"Yeah, I'll make sure to do that. I'm sorry for missing the practice without letting you know first.",2024-09-03 22:14:02
13046,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_1,"Apology accepted, Emma. Let's focus on moving forward and keeping each other in the loop.",2024-09-03 22:17:02
13047,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_2,"Thanks, Coach. I'll definitely keep you informed from now on.",2024-09-03 22:20:02
13048,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_1,Good. Let's get back to practice and catch up on what you missed.,2024-09-03 22:30:02
13049,deescalatory_conversation_336,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'm ready to give it my all!",2024-09-03 22:39:02
13050,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_1,"Tim, you didn't do your part of the group project. We almost missed the deadline because of you.",2024-09-03 21:30:06
13051,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Alice. I had a family emergency, and it slipped my mind.",2024-09-03 21:40:06
13052,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_1,"We all have things going on, but you should've at least let us know. Kylie and I had to stay up all night to finish it.",2024-09-03 21:49:06
13053,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_3,"Tim, we understand emergencies happen, but communication is key. Next time, just give us a heads-up.",2024-09-03 21:52:06
13054,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_2,You're right. I'll make sure to communicate better in the future. Can I do anything to make it up to you both now?,2024-09-03 21:56:06
13055,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_1,Maybe you could help us prepare for the presentation next week. We still have a lot to organize.,2024-09-03 21:57:06
13056,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'd be happy to. Let's meet after class today to go over what needs to be done.",2024-09-03 22:05:06
13057,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_3,"Sounds like a plan. Thanks for being willing to step up, Tim.",2024-09-03 22:11:06
13058,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_2,Thanks for giving me the chance to make things right. I won't let you down again.,2024-09-03 22:12:06
13059,deescalatory_conversation_337,speaker_1,"Alright, let's move forward and make sure our presentation is great.",2024-09-03 22:13:06
13060,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_1,Why did you decide to cancel our presentation without consulting me first?,2024-09-03 21:37:09
13061,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_2,"I didn't cancel it, I just rescheduled it for next week because we weren't ready.",2024-09-03 21:39:09
13062,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_1,You could have at least told me. I was preparing all night!,2024-09-03 21:44:09
13063,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_2,"I understand, I should have communicated that. I genuinely thought it would be less stressful for both of us.",2024-09-03 21:51:09
13064,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_1,"I get that you were trying to help, but it felt like you weren't considering my input.",2024-09-03 21:53:09
13065,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_2,"You're right, I didn't think about how it would impact you. Let's discuss how we can keep each other in the loop better next time.",2024-09-03 21:57:09
13066,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_1,I'd appreciate that. Maybe we could set specific times for quick check-ins?,2024-09-03 21:58:09
13067,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_2,That's a good idea. How about we have a brief call every evening until the presentation?,2024-09-03 22:02:09
13068,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_1,"Sounds good to me. That way, we're both on the same page and can avoid misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 22:05:09
13069,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_2,"Agreed. We both want this presentation to be great, and I think better communication will help us achieve that.",2024-09-03 22:13:09
13070,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_1,Absolutely. Thanks for understanding where I'm coming from.,2024-09-03 22:20:09
13071,deescalatory_conversation_338,speaker_2,Thank you for pointing it out. Let's make this presentation the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:24:09
13072,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,"I noticed you've been coming home really late for the past week, Amanda.",2024-09-03 21:32:12
13073,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,"I know, Mom. I've just been hanging out with friends after school.",2024-09-03 21:34:12
13074,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,I'm worried because you didn't finish your homework any of those nights.,2024-09-03 21:44:12
13075,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,But it's just for one week! I needed to relax a bit.,2024-09-03 21:54:12
13076,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,"I understand the need to relax, but your grades have been slipping.",2024-09-03 21:56:12
13077,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,Can we not make this such a big deal? I'll catch up this weekend.,2024-09-03 22:02:12
13078,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,"It's not just about catching up, Amanda. It's about building good habits.",2024-09-03 22:11:12
13079,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,"Fine, fine. But I also need some time to myself.",2024-09-03 22:16:12
13080,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,"Absolutely, and we can find a balance. Maybe setting specific times for fun and homework could help?",2024-09-03 22:26:12
13081,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,"Yeah, I guess having a schedule might work.",2024-09-03 22:32:12
13082,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,"Let's try it out, and if it doesn't, we can adjust it.",2024-09-03 22:40:12
13083,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,"Alright, I'll give it a shot.",2024-09-03 22:43:12
13084,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_1,Thank you. I want you to enjoy your time but also succeed in school.,2024-09-03 22:44:12
13085,deescalatory_conversation_339,speaker_2,"Thanks, Mom. I appreciate you looking out for me.",2024-09-03 22:45:12
13086,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took credit for my ideas in the meeting, Alice.",2024-09-03 21:31:17
13087,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,"John, it's not like that. I didn't mean to overshadow you.",2024-09-03 21:38:17
13088,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,But you did! Everyone thinks it was your idea now.,2024-09-03 21:42:17
13089,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,I see why you're upset. How about we clarify things in the next meeting?,2024-09-03 21:44:17
13090,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,How do I know you won't just do it again?,2024-09-03 21:50:17
13091,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,I understand your concern. Let's make a plan together to ensure we're both recognized.,2024-09-03 21:56:17
13092,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,Okay… but it still feels like you don’t really value my input.,2024-09-03 22:00:17
13093,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,Your input is valuable. I should have acknowledged your contributions right then. I'm sorry.,2024-09-03 22:06:17
13094,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,"Alright, thanks. But we need to work on better communication.",2024-09-03 22:10:17
13095,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,Agreed. Maybe we can set aside some time to review updates together before meetings.,2024-09-03 22:12:17
13096,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Let's try that and see how it goes.,2024-09-03 22:21:17
13097,deescalatory_conversation_340,speaker_2,"Perfect, let's move forward with that plan. Thank you for being open to resolving this.",2024-09-03 22:28:17
13098,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_1,Why didn't you come to the group meeting last night? We really needed your input.,2024-09-03 21:33:20
13099,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,I had a lot of homework and I couldn’t make it. But I thought you guys could handle it.,2024-09-03 21:42:20
13100,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_3,"We did, but it wasn't as effective without you. We needed your perspective on the project.",2024-09-03 21:50:20
13101,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_1,"Yeah, and now we're a bit behind schedule. We need to make up for lost time.",2024-09-03 21:59:20
13102,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to let you all down. How can I help now?",2024-09-03 22:09:20
13103,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_3,We appreciate that. Can you take the lead on the research part?,2024-09-03 22:17:20
13104,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I can start on that right away. Can you send me the notes from the last meeting?",2024-09-03 22:26:20
13105,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_1,"Sure, I'll send them over. If you have any questions, just let us know.",2024-09-03 22:35:20
13106,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,"Thanks, I really want to make it up to the team. Let’s regroup and make this project the best it can be.",2024-09-03 22:36:20
13107,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_3,"That's the spirit! With your help, we can definitely get back on track.",2024-09-03 22:38:20
13108,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's set another meeting this weekend to check our progress. Does that work for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:46:20
13109,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_2,Works for me.,2024-09-03 22:49:20
13110,deescalatory_conversation_341,speaker_3,"Works for me too. Let's do this, team!",2024-09-03 22:56:20
13111,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,"Hey, can we talk about the project timeline? I'm concerned it's too tight.",2024-09-03 21:39:26
13112,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,"I understand your concern, but we're already committed to the deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:41:26
13113,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,"I get that, but maybe we can negotiate for a small extension to ensure quality.",2024-09-03 21:43:26
13114,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,What specifically do you think could benefit from extra time?,2024-09-03 21:52:26
13115,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,"The testing phase. If we rush it, we might miss critical bugs.",2024-09-03 21:55:26
13116,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,Fair point. How much additional time do you think we need?,2024-09-03 21:59:26
13117,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,Even an extra week would make a big difference.,2024-09-03 22:06:26
13118,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,I'll talk to the client about possibly adjusting the timeline.,2024-09-03 22:13:26
13119,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate it. It's more about delivering a solid product.",2024-09-03 22:21:26
13120,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,"Absolutely, quality should always be our top priority.",2024-09-03 22:22:26
13121,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,Do you think the client will understand our need for an extension?,2024-09-03 22:29:26
13122,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,I'll explain that it's in their best interest for a robust end product.,2024-09-03 22:35:26
13123,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,Great. Let me know if you need any support in those discussions.,2024-09-03 22:39:26
13124,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,Will do. Let's also make sure we're as efficient as possible in other areas.,2024-09-03 22:40:26
13125,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,Agreed. I'll review our current progress and see if there are any other potential bottlenecks.,2024-09-03 22:43:26
13126,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_2,That would be very helpful. Thanks for bringing this up constructively.,2024-09-03 22:45:26
13127,deescalatory_conversation_342,speaker_1,Thanks for being open to the conversation. I think this,2024-09-03 22:50:26
13128,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball in the last minute of the game.,2024-09-03 21:39:30
13129,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_2,"You were surrounded by defenders, it wasn't a good play.",2024-09-03 21:45:30
13130,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_1,"But I was open for a second, you could've taken the chance.",2024-09-03 21:46:30
13131,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_2,"I get that, but I had to make a quick decision. It wasn't personal.",2024-09-03 21:55:30
13132,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_3,"Guys, the game's over. Let's focus on what we can improve for next time.",2024-09-03 22:05:30
13133,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_1,I'm just frustrated. We had a chance to win.,2024-09-03 22:09:30
13134,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_2,"I know, I get frustrated too. Maybe we can work on communication during practice.",2024-09-03 22:13:30
13135,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_3,That's a good idea. We need to trust each other more on the court.,2024-09-03 22:18:30
13136,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_1,"Alright, fair enough. Let's try to be more aware of each other's positions.",2024-09-03 22:19:30
13137,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_2,"Agreed. And if you think you’re open, call for the ball louder.",2024-09-03 22:20:30
13138,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_3,"Sounds like a plan. We’re a team, and we win or lose together.",2024-09-03 22:22:30
13139,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_1,"Yeah, we should keep our heads up. We'll get them next time.",2024-09-03 22:26:30
13140,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's hit the court tomorrow and work on our plays.,2024-09-03 22:36:30
13141,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_3,"Okay, it's settled then. Team huddle?",2024-09-03 22:39:30
13142,deescalatory_conversation_343,speaker_1,Team huddle.,2024-09-03 22:48:30
13143,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_1,"Jack, I saw that you used my laptop without asking again.",2024-09-03 21:36:34
13144,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_2,"Maria, I needed it for an important project. It's not a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:40:34
13145,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_1,It is a big deal to me. You've done this multiple times now without my permission.,2024-09-03 21:47:34
13146,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_2,"I understand, but I was in a pinch. I'll ask next time, okay?",2024-09-03 21:55:34
13147,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, but what if I needed it for something urgent?",2024-09-03 22:05:34
13148,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_2,Then we should come up with a better system so this doesn’t keep happening.,2024-09-03 22:14:34
13149,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_1,Agreed. Maybe we can set specific times when each of us can use it.,2024-09-03 22:15:34
13150,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_2,"That sounds fair. How about you use it during the day, and I use it in the evening?",2024-09-03 22:16:34
13151,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_1,"That works for me. But if something changes, we need to talk about it first.",2024-09-03 22:19:34
13152,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I’ll make sure to check in before using it. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:20:34
13153,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_1,"No problem, just glad we can find a solution. Let's stick to this plan.",2024-09-03 22:22:34
13154,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_2,Deal. And sorry again for not asking before.,2024-09-03 22:25:34
13155,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let's move forward and communicate better.,2024-09-03 22:35:34
13156,deescalatory_conversation_344,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for bringing it up calmly, Maria.",2024-09-03 22:45:34
13157,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_1,Why did you go ahead and publish the team project's results without consulting anyone?,2024-09-03 21:37:39
13158,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_2,I thought we were on the same page about the final data and it seemed like it was time-sensitive.,2024-09-03 21:39:39
13159,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_1,But we agreed that we would all review it together before making it public.,2024-09-03 21:44:39
13160,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I didn't think it would be an issue given how close the deadline was.",2024-09-03 21:52:39
13161,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_3,"This is affecting our overall grade, and importantly, our collaboration. It's not just about the deadline; it's about teamwork.",2024-09-03 21:56:39
13162,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_2,I see your point. Maybe I overstepped in my eagerness to get it done.,2024-09-03 22:01:39
13163,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_1,We need to find a way to avoid something like this in the future. Any ideas?,2024-09-03 22:04:39
13164,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_3,Perhaps we could set specific roles and responsibilities with clear communication timelines.,2024-09-03 22:10:39
13165,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_2,That makes sense. We could also use a shared calendar to track deadlines and review points.,2024-09-03 22:20:39
13166,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_1,Agreed. A shared calendar would help us all stay on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:24:39
13167,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_3,I'm glad we talked this through. Let's make sure to communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:28:39
13168,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for being understanding, and I'll be more mindful in the future.",2024-09-03 22:37:39
13169,deescalatory_conversation_345,speaker_1,"Let's finish the current project strong, together.",2024-09-03 22:42:39
13170,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_1,"Why didn't you finish the group project on time, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:30:43
13171,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_2,"I told you, I had a family emergency. I couldn't.",2024-09-03 21:40:43
13172,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_1,But you didn't even inform us about it! We were left scrambling.,2024-09-03 21:48:43
13173,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_2,I'm really sorry. It was sudden and I didn't have time to tell anyone.,2024-09-03 21:50:43
13174,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_3,"Alex, we understand emergencies happen, but we needed to know what was going on.",2024-09-03 21:57:43
13175,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_2,I get it. I should have at least sent a quick message. I messed up.,2024-09-03 21:59:43
13176,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_1,We missed the presentation slot. What are we going to do now?,2024-09-03 22:01:43
13177,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_2,How about I talk to the professor and explain my situation? Maybe we can ask for another chance.,2024-09-03 22:08:43
13178,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_1,That might work. But we also need to plan better for next time.,2024-09-03 22:13:43
13179,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's also decide on backup plans in case something like this happens again.,2024-09-03 22:16:43
13180,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_2,Absolutely. I don't want to let you guys down again.,2024-09-03 22:17:43
13181,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_1,"Alright, let's give the professor a shot and also set up a better communication system in our group.",2024-09-03 22:18:43
13182,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_3,Sounds good to me. Let's regroup and work out how we can improve.,2024-09-03 22:19:43
13183,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_2,I'll draft an email to the professor right now and share it with you for approval.,2024-09-03 22:22:43
13184,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. Let's make sure we learn from this.",2024-09-03 22:30:43
13185,deescalatory_conversation_346,speaker_3,"Yeah,",2024-09-03 22:39:43
13186,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,"Hey, Alex, why didn't you pass me the ball during the game? I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:34:47
13187,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"Sorry, Jordan, I didn't see you there. I was trying to make a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:40:47
13188,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,It feels like you never see me. I'm getting frustrated with always being ignored.,2024-09-03 21:46:47
13189,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"I get that, but it's not intentional. I'm often focused on getting the ball to the goal as fast as possible.",2024-09-03 21:52:47
13190,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,"But we’re a team, Alex. You need to use everyone on the field or we won't win.",2024-09-03 22:01:47
13191,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,You're right. I need to work on my awareness and teamwork. How about we practice some drills together?,2024-09-03 22:07:47
13192,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,That sounds good. Maybe some passing drills so we can get in sync.,2024-09-03 22:15:47
13193,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"Absolutely. The more we practice, the better we'll understand each other’s moves.",2024-09-03 22:21:47
13194,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's meet up after school tomorrow and work on this.,2024-09-03 22:22:47
13195,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,"Perfect. And Jordan, I appreciate you bringing this up. I want us to win as a team.",2024-09-03 22:31:47
13196,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. I just want us all to do our best and feel included.",2024-09-03 22:35:47
13197,deescalatory_conversation_347,speaker_2,Me too. Let's get better together and show everyone what we can do.,2024-09-03 22:42:47
13198,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball! We could've won that game!,2024-09-03 21:31:50
13199,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,I didn't see you open! I was trying to make the best play I could.,2024-09-03 21:40:50
13200,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,But I was right there! You need to have better awareness on the court.,2024-09-03 21:45:50
13201,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you, calm down. We’re all on the same team here.",2024-09-03 21:48:50
13202,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,It's not like I did it on purpose. I was under a lot of pressure.,2024-09-03 21:52:50
13203,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,"I know, but we’ve practiced those plays a lot. We need to execute better.",2024-09-03 22:00:50
13204,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_3,Maybe we should focus on reviewing our positioning and communication during practice tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:01:50
13205,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. I could definitely use some more practice with our plays.,2024-09-03 22:11:50
13206,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,Agreed. Let’s work on that so we can improve as a team.,2024-09-03 22:21:50
13207,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_3,"Great. Remember, we win and lose together. Let's get better from this.",2024-09-03 22:27:50
13208,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_2,"Thanks, guys. I'll do my best to be more aware next time.",2024-09-03 22:36:50
13209,deescalatory_conversation_348,speaker_1,And I’ll call out for the ball louder. We’ve got this.,2024-09-03 22:45:50
13210,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,Why did you make that call on the final play without consulting the team?,2024-09-03 21:33:55
13211,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,I thought it was the best move given the situation. We were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:34:55
13212,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_3,But that move cost us the game. We should've taken the safer route.,2024-09-03 21:35:55
13213,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,"I understand your frustration, but I saw an opening and decided to take a risk.",2024-09-03 21:39:55
13214,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,Couldn't you have at least signaled us? We were all confused on the field.,2024-09-03 21:42:55
13215,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. Let's talk about how we can handle these situations in the future.,2024-09-03 21:50:55
13216,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_3,"Maybe we can establish a quick signal system for future decisions. That way, we all know what's happening.",2024-09-03 21:58:55
13217,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,"That sounds like a good idea. That way, no one's left in the dark.",2024-09-03 22:07:55
13218,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,"Yes, let's work on that in our next practice session. I don't want us to feel divided like this again.",2024-09-03 22:14:55
13219,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_3,Agreed. We need to stay united if we want to win.,2024-09-03 22:18:55
13220,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_1,"Alright, let's put this behind us and focus on improving our communication. The goal is to make sure these misunderstandings don't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:19:55
13221,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for understanding and being open to discuss this. Let's move forward together.,2024-09-03 22:26:55
13222,deescalatory_conversation_349,speaker_3,Definitely. Let's get back to practice and ensure our teamwork is stronger than ever.,2024-09-03 22:34:55
13223,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me about the change in the project deadline, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:39:58
13224,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"I thought everyone got the email. I assumed you knew, Jordan.",2024-09-03 21:48:58
13225,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,"Well, I didn't. Now we're behind schedule, and it's affecting everyone.",2024-09-03 21:49:58
13226,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Jordan. I should have double-checked. How can we catch up now?",2024-09-03 21:59:58
13227,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,We need to divide the remaining tasks more efficiently. Can you handle the design part?,2024-09-03 22:06:58
13228,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"Sure, I can do that. I'll make sure it's finished by tomorrow. What about the content creation?",2024-09-03 22:07:58
13229,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,I'll take care of that. Let's also update the team so everyone knows what they need to do.,2024-09-03 22:12:58
13230,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"Good idea. I'll send out a message right away, clarifying the new tasks and deadlines.",2024-09-03 22:13:58
13231,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. Let's make sure we communicate better moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:15:58
13232,deescalatory_conversation_350,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Jordan. We'll finish this project together without any more hiccups.",2024-09-03 22:20:58
13233,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,Why did you delete my code from the project repository?,2024-09-03 21:35:02
13234,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,"Because it was causing the program to crash, and we were running out of time to fix it.",2024-09-03 21:44:02
13235,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,You didn't even tell me! I was totally blindsided when I checked the repo.,2024-09-03 21:46:02
13236,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,I should’ve communicated it better. I was stressed about meeting the deadline.,2024-09-03 21:48:02
13237,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,"I get that, but I worked hard on that code. If there were issues, we could have debugged it together.",2024-09-03 21:54:02
13238,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,"You're right. Next time, I'll make sure to involve you before making any drastic changes.",2024-09-03 21:56:02
13239,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Let’s see if we can merge your changes with some of the features I coded.",2024-09-03 22:01:02
13240,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,"That sounds good. Let’s prioritize getting this project stable first, and then we can integrate features.",2024-09-03 22:10:02
13241,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,Agreed. I’ll start by reviewing your latest commits to understand the current state.,2024-09-03 22:17:02
13242,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,"Perfect. And if you find anything problematic, we can pair up to fix it.",2024-09-03 22:25:02
13243,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,Deal. Let’s knock this out and make sure we deliver something we’re both proud of.,2024-09-03 22:31:02
13244,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:41:02
13245,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_1,No problem. Let’s just make this project great.,2024-09-03 22:46:02
13246,deescalatory_conversation_351,speaker_2,"Together, we will.",2024-09-03 22:49:02
13247,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't include my research in the project report.,2024-09-03 21:39:05
13248,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_2,Your research didn't align with the objectives we agreed on.,2024-09-03 21:48:05
13249,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_1,But it was still relevant and could have added value to our findings.,2024-09-03 21:49:05
13250,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_2,I see your point. Maybe we could have discussed it better before finalizing the report.,2024-09-03 21:52:05
13251,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_1,"Yeah, instead of just excluding it without a word.",2024-09-03 21:56:05
13252,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_2,That's fair. I apologize for not communicating my decision. Can we review it together now and see if there's an opportunity to include it?,2024-09-03 22:03:05
13253,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_1,I appreciate that. Let's look at it and see where it might fit into the existing sections.,2024-09-03 22:07:05
13254,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_2,"Great, I think your data on the environmental impact could really strengthen our sustainability analysis.",2024-09-03 22:12:05
13255,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_1,"Exactly, that's what I was trying to contribute. I'm glad we're finally on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:19:05
13256,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_2,It looks like there's a section on long-term effects that could use more depth. Should we start there?,2024-09-03 22:26:05
13257,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_1,"Yes, let's do that. Thanks for being open to revisiting this.",2024-09-03 22:36:05
13258,deescalatory_conversation_352,speaker_2,No problem. Working together like this will make our project stronger.,2024-09-03 22:40:05
13259,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,"James, why did you use all the paint supplies without telling anyone? I needed them for the art project!",2024-09-03 21:39:10
13260,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_2,"I’m sorry, Emily. I didn't realize you still needed them. I thought the project was done.",2024-09-03 21:48:10
13261,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,"Well, it's not. Now I have to find more supplies before the deadline tomorrow. This isn't the first time you've done something like this.",2024-09-03 21:56:10
13262,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_2,"I know, I need to be more mindful. Do you want me to help you get new supplies?",2024-09-03 22:03:10
13263,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,That would be helpful. Where do you think we can find the same colors and brushes at this hour?,2024-09-03 22:08:10
13264,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_2,There's a store a few blocks away that’s usually open late. We can check there first.,2024-09-03 22:10:10
13265,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,"Alright, let’s do that. But next time, please check before using communal supplies.",2024-09-03 22:11:10
13266,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’ll make sure to ask next time. Let’s go and get those supplies so you can finish your project.,2024-09-03 22:16:10
13267,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_1,"Thanks, James. I appreciate your help.",2024-09-03 22:17:10
13268,deescalatory_conversation_353,speaker_2,"No problem, Emily. Let’s make sure you get your project done on time.",2024-09-03 22:19:10
13269,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_1,Why did you go ahead and book the flight without asking anyone else?,2024-09-03 21:32:13
13270,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_2,I thought it would be easier to just get everything sorted out early. Isn't that what we wanted?,2024-09-03 21:38:13
13271,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_1,"Well, we were supposed to discuss the dates first. Now Alex and Sam might not be able to join us.",2024-09-03 21:40:13
13272,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_3,"Yeah, I'm really stressed about fitting this into my schedule.",2024-09-03 21:44:13
13273,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_2,"I see, I didn't realize it would be such an issue. Can we maybe find a way to adjust the plan now?",2024-09-03 21:46:13
13274,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_1,"It won't be easy, but we should definitely try. Let's pull out our calendars and see what we can do.",2024-09-03 21:56:13
13275,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_3,Agreed. We should make sure everyone is on the same page moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:06:13
13276,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_2,I appreciate that. I didn't mean to exclude anyone. Let's work it out together.,2024-09-03 22:13:13
13277,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_1,"Great, thanks for understanding. Alex and Sam will be grateful too.",2024-09-03 22:15:13
13278,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_3,I'll get in touch with them and see what dates work best. We can figure out the rest from there.,2024-09-03 22:20:13
13279,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_2,"Perfect. Next time, let's schedule a meeting before making any major decisions.",2024-09-03 22:24:13
13280,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_1,Absolutely. Good communication will save us a lot of hassle.,2024-09-03 22:30:13
13281,deescalatory_conversation_354,speaker_3,"Sounds like a plan. Thanks, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:34:13
13282,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my part of the project report, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:38:15
13283,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_2,"I didn’t delete it, Maria. I revised it because it was too wordy.",2024-09-03 21:42:15
13284,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_1,Too wordy? I spent hours refining it to get all the details in.,2024-09-03 21:51:15
13285,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_2,"I understand that, but we need to be concise to stay within the page limit.",2024-09-03 21:54:15
13286,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_1,But you didn't even ask me or let me know!,2024-09-03 21:56:15
13287,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_2,I should have communicated better. How about we go over it together and make sure both our points are included efficiently?,2024-09-03 21:59:15
13288,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_1,I'd appreciate that. I just felt undermined because I put a lot of effort into it.,2024-09-03 22:00:15
13289,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_2,I get it. Let’s combine your thoroughness with my focus on brevity. Deal?,2024-09-03 22:03:15
13290,deescalatory_conversation_355,speaker_1,Deal. Let's work on it now and finish strong.,2024-09-03 22:12:15
13291,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you didn't finish your part of the group project, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:34:20
13292,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_2,I told you guys I had a family emergency. I thought you'd cover for me.,2024-09-03 21:36:20
13293,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_1,"We're all dealing with stuff, but we had deadlines. Why didn't you communicate better?",2024-09-03 21:44:20
13294,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_2,I did! I sent a message in the group chat. Did none of you see it?,2024-09-03 21:46:20
13295,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_3,"I saw the message, but it was really last minute. We had to scramble to adjust.",2024-09-03 21:49:20
13296,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_4,"It felt like you left us hanging, Sarah. We've been planning this for weeks.",2024-09-03 21:50:20
13297,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_2,"Look, I'm sorry. My uncle had a heart attack, and it was chaotic. I didn't mean to leave you guys in a bad spot.",2024-09-03 21:59:20
13298,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_1,"That sounds tough. We understand emergencies happen, but we need better coordination next time.",2024-09-03 22:01:20
13299,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_3,Exactly. Maybe we can set up a backup plan for situations like this in the future?,2024-09-03 22:02:20
13300,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_4,That's a good idea. We should all have each other's contact info outside the chat too.,2024-09-03 22:08:20
13301,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_2,I agree. I didn’t mean to cause this much trouble. How can I help fix it now?,2024-09-03 22:10:20
13302,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_1,We can start by reassigning some parts of the work. Can you handle the presentation slides?,2024-09-03 22:13:20
13303,deescalatory_conversation_356,speaker_2,"Yes, I can do that. I’ll make sure they’re ready by tomorrow.",2024-09-03 22:20:20
13304,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't bring the instruments back to the music room after rehearsal, Jason.",2024-09-03 21:31:23
13305,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Thompson. I thought Maria was taking care of that.",2024-09-03 21:40:23
13306,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_3,"Jason, you know I was busy organizing the sheet music. We talked about dividing responsibilities!",2024-09-03 21:46:23
13307,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_2,"Look, I know I messed up. Can we figure out a way to make sure this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 21:53:23
13308,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_1,Let’s start with creating a clear checklist for after-rehearsal duties. How does that sound?,2024-09-03 21:58:23
13309,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_3,That sounds reasonable. We could also rotate responsibilities each week.,2024-09-03 22:03:23
13310,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_2,"I agree. That way, everyone knows exactly what they're supposed to do.",2024-09-03 22:11:23
13311,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_1,"Good. And remember, communication is key. If you can't handle your task, let someone else know in advance.",2024-09-03 22:21:23
13312,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_3,"Absolutely. We’re a team, and we need to work together to keep things running smoothly.",2024-09-03 22:31:23
13313,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_2,"I understand. Thanks for not getting too upset, and for helping find a solution.",2024-09-03 22:34:23
13314,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_1,It's all about learning and improving. Let's move forward and make sure we each do our part.,2024-09-03 22:43:23
13315,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_3,Agreed. We'll be more coordinated from now on.,2024-09-03 22:48:23
13316,deescalatory_conversation_357,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:58:23
13317,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_1,Why did you submit the group project without showing it to us first?,2024-09-03 21:38:26
13318,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_2,I thought it was finished and everyone would be okay with it.,2024-09-03 21:45:26
13319,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_1,But we had agreed to review it together before submission.,2024-09-03 21:46:26
13320,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_2,"I understand, but I was worried about the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:48:26
13321,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_3,We could have reviewed it quickly. It wouldn't have taken much time.,2024-09-03 21:52:26
13322,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_2,I get that. I honestly didn't mean to cause any trouble.,2024-09-03 21:56:26
13323,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_1,"It's not about trouble, it's about teamwork. We need to communicate better.",2024-09-03 21:57:26
13324,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_2,You're right. I should have trusted that we could meet the deadline together.,2024-09-03 22:03:26
13325,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_3,Can we make sure this doesn't happen in future projects?,2024-09-03 22:04:26
13326,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_2,"Definitely. From now on, let's set a reminder for a final review.",2024-09-03 22:13:26
13327,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_1,"Agreed. We all want the best outcome, so sticking to our plan is key.",2024-09-03 22:20:26
13328,deescalatory_conversation_358,speaker_3,"Thanks for understanding, everyone. Let's move forward and do better.",2024-09-03 22:24:26
13329,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball in the last few minutes of the game, Alex. We could have tied it up!",2024-09-03 21:38:31
13330,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_2,"I know you're upset, Jordan, but I thought I saw an opening and went for it. I didn't mean to ignore you.",2024-09-03 21:44:31
13331,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_1,"Still, we were down by just one goal. I was in a better position. We need to work on our communication.",2024-09-03 21:54:31
13332,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_3,"Alex, maybe next time we should have a quick check-in before making a final push. Just to make sure everyone knows the plan.",2024-09-03 22:02:31
13333,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_2,"That makes sense, Taylor. We should definitely do that. But, Jordan, I really thought I saw an opportunity.",2024-09-03 22:09:31
13334,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_1,"I get it, Alex. Heat of the moment and all. It's just frustrating to miss such a crucial play.",2024-09-03 22:16:31
13335,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_3,Why don't we all take some time to look at the game footage? We can learn what went wrong and improve for next time.,2024-09-03 22:22:31
13336,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_2,"Agreed, Taylor. Watching the footage together might highlight areas we can all work on.",2024-09-03 22:26:31
13337,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_1,"Alright, that sounds fair. Let's focus on getting better rather than pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 22:28:31
13338,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_3,"Yeah, we're a team. If we stick together and communicate better, we’ll be stronger.",2024-09-03 22:33:31
13339,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_2,"Thanks for understanding, Jordan. Let's use this as a learning experience.",2024-09-03 22:37:31
13340,deescalatory_conversation_359,speaker_1,"Yeah, no hard feelings.",2024-09-03 22:40:31
13341,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_1,"Jenna, we need to talk about the project deadline.",2024-09-03 21:32:35
13342,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_2,"Yeah, Mike, I know. But I’ve been swamped with other work.",2024-09-03 21:34:35
13343,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_1,"I understand, but you’ve missed three meetings already. It’s affecting our progress.",2024-09-03 21:35:35
13344,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_2,I get that. I just feel like we’re not evenly distributing the tasks.,2024-09-03 21:36:35
13345,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_1,How can we better distribute the tasks so it’s more manageable for you?,2024-09-03 21:39:35
13346,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_2,"If I could handle the research part, that would help. And maybe someone else could do the data entry?",2024-09-03 21:44:35
13347,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. I can take on the data entry.,2024-09-03 21:54:35
13348,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_2,"Thanks, Mike. And for the upcoming presentation, can we review each slide together to ensure it’s cohesive?",2024-09-03 22:03:35
13349,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let’s set some time tomorrow afternoon to go through it.,2024-09-03 22:12:35
13350,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_2,That works for me. I’ll make sure the research is done by then.,2024-09-03 22:13:35
13351,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_1,"Great. By working together, we can get this done on time.",2024-09-03 22:23:35
13352,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for being flexible. I appreciate it.,2024-09-03 22:33:35
13353,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_1,"No problem. We’re a team, and I want to make sure we succeed together.",2024-09-03 22:42:35
13354,deescalatory_conversation_360,speaker_2,Let’s do this!,2024-09-03 22:44:35
13355,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_1,"Max, why did you just leave mid-practice yesterday?",2024-09-03 21:39:39
13356,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_2,"Coach, I had an emergency come up. I didn't mean to ditch the team.",2024-09-03 21:46:39
13357,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_1,You know how important practice is. We're already struggling this season.,2024-09-03 21:55:39
13358,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_3,"Yeah, Max, we count on you. What was the emergency anyway?",2024-09-03 21:57:39
13359,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_2,My sister got into a car accident. I had to go to the hospital.,2024-09-03 22:05:39
13360,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell someone before leaving?,2024-09-03 22:09:39
13361,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_2,I was in a panic. I just grabbed my stuff and ran out.,2024-09-03 22:18:39
13362,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_4,"Look, can we just move on and focus on the game? We're playing the top team next week.",2024-09-03 22:27:39
13363,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_1,"We can move on, but we need better communication. Next time, tell someone. We're a team, and we need to act like one.",2024-09-03 22:37:39
13364,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_2,You're right. I'll make sure to inform someone next time.,2024-09-03 22:43:39
13365,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_3,"Hey, Max, sorry to hear about your sister. Is she doing okay now?",2024-09-03 22:53:39
13366,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_2,"Thanks, Tom. Yeah, she's recovering. Should be out of the hospital soon.",2024-09-03 22:57:39
13367,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_4,"Alright, let's make this practice count. We need to stick together.",2024-09-03 23:00:39
13368,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's work harder and support each other. We're in this together.,2024-09-03 23:01:39
13369,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_2,I'm committed. Count on me to improve and communicate better.,2024-09-03 23:08:39
13370,deescalatory_conversation_361,speaker_3,Same,2024-09-03 23:15:39
13371,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up to the band practice yesterday? We needed you.,2024-09-03 21:40:43
13372,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,I had something important to take care of. Why didn't anyone bother to tell me practice had been rescheduled?,2024-09-03 21:48:43
13373,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,"We did, but you never responded to the group chat message.",2024-09-03 21:51:43
13374,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"I don't always check the group chat, you know that. Can’t someone call or text me directly?",2024-09-03 22:00:43
13375,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,"Okay, I get that. But isn't it your responsibility to keep up with band updates?",2024-09-03 22:03:43
13376,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"Yeah, but communication is a two-way street. How about you give me a quick heads-up next time?",2024-09-03 22:11:43
13377,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,That's fair. We can definitely make sure to text you directly in the future.,2024-09-03 22:18:43
13378,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"Thanks, I appreciate that. I’ll make more effort to check the group chat regularly, too.",2024-09-03 22:20:43
13379,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,"Great, we really need everyone to be on the same page if we're going to nail this upcoming gig.",2024-09-03 22:29:43
13380,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,Totally. I’m committed to making it work. Anything specific we need to catch up on from the missed practice?,2024-09-03 22:36:43
13381,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,We worked on the new setlist and made some changes. I’ll share the notes with you.,2024-09-03 22:40:43
13382,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"Awesome, I’ll review them and practice extra to catch up.",2024-09-03 22:49:43
13383,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let’s smash this gig together.,2024-09-03 22:50:43
13384,deescalatory_conversation_362,speaker_2,"Absolutely, we’ve got this. Thanks for understanding",2024-09-03 22:53:43
13385,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were going to work on the project without me?,2024-09-03 21:36:47
13386,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,"I know you were busy with other assignments, so I thought it would be better if I went ahead.",2024-09-03 21:37:47
13387,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,But we agreed to work on it together. Now you've made critical decisions without my input.,2024-09-03 21:44:47
13388,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,I understand your frustration. What decisions do you disagree with?,2024-09-03 21:49:47
13389,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,"For starters, the design layout. It's not at all what we discussed.",2024-09-03 21:52:47
13390,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,I see your point. What was your vision for the layout?,2024-09-03 21:53:47
13391,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,I was thinking something more interactive and user-friendly. What you have now is too text-heavy.,2024-09-03 21:55:47
13392,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,That makes sense. How can we adjust the current design to better fit your vision?,2024-09-03 21:59:47
13393,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,We could add more visual elements and reorganize the content to make it more engaging.,2024-09-03 22:08:47
13394,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,I can work on that. Do you want to review the other sections together to make sure we're on the same page?,2024-09-03 22:13:47
13395,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,"Yes, I think that would help. Let's start with the introduction.",2024-09-03 22:17:47
13396,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,Alright. Can you share your thoughts on the introduction first?,2024-09-03 22:26:47
13397,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,Sure. I think it needs a stronger hook to grab the reader's attention immediately.,2024-09-03 22:33:47
13398,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_2,Got it. How about incorporating a real-life example or a compelling quote?,2024-09-03 22:36:47
13399,deescalatory_conversation_363,speaker_1,A real-life example sounds good. It will,2024-09-03 22:40:47
13400,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"Michael, we need to talk about the project proposal you submitted.",2024-09-03 21:32:51
13401,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"What about it, Sarah? I worked hard on that.",2024-09-03 21:36:51
13402,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"I can see that, but there were several factual errors that we can't afford to overlook.",2024-09-03 21:46:51
13403,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,Like what? I thought I triple-checked everything.,2024-09-03 21:53:51
13404,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"For instance, the budget estimates were off by a significant margin, and some of the market research data was outdated.",2024-09-03 21:59:51
13405,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,Really? I used the numbers from last quarter.,2024-09-03 22:05:51
13406,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"Yes, but those numbers have been revised recently. We needed the most current data to back up our projections.",2024-09-03 22:06:51
13407,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"I get what you're saying, but it's stressful trying to keep up with all these changes.",2024-09-03 22:07:51
13408,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"I understand, and it's a lot for one person to handle. Maybe we could improve our communication so updates are clear and timely.",2024-09-03 22:16:51
13409,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,That sounds fair. Maybe we could set a weekly check-in to go over any new information.,2024-09-03 22:25:51
13410,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,I think that's a great idea. We can avoid future misunderstandings that way.,2024-09-03 22:34:51
13411,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"Okay, let's schedule it then. Thanks for bringing this up constructively.",2024-09-03 22:40:51
13412,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_1,"No problem, Michael. We're on the same team, after all. Let's make this project the best it can be.",2024-09-03 22:46:51
13413,deescalatory_conversation_364,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for understanding, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:51:51
13414,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead with the project without even consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:31:55
13415,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,"I did consult you, multiple times. You didn't respond to any of my messages.",2024-09-03 21:36:55
13416,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,I was away handling another urgent matter. That doesn't mean you go ahead and make all the decisions solo.,2024-09-03 21:39:55
13417,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,"Look, the project deadline was approaching. We couldn't afford to sit and wait. I had to make a call.",2024-09-03 21:48:55
13418,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,But making changes to the project without my input? That's just disrespectful.,2024-09-03 21:50:55
13419,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,"I understand why you're upset. Maybe I could have waited a bit longer, but we were under a lot of pressure.",2024-09-03 21:55:55
13420,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,What we needed was better communication. We both dropped the ball there.,2024-09-03 22:03:55
13421,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's focus on how we can fix what's been done and improve our communication moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:06:55
13422,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,Sounds fair. Maybe setting specific check-in times could help us stay on the same page?,2024-09-03 22:10:55
13423,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,I like that idea. Let's start setting daily updates to discuss our progress and any changes we want to make.,2024-09-03 22:14:55
13424,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,And can we also create a shared document for all project-related decisions so nothing gets overlooked?,2024-09-03 22:24:55
13425,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,Definitely. A shared document will help us both keep track. Let's get started on that right away.,2024-09-03 22:25:55
13426,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_1,"Perfect, I'm glad we could sort this out. Teamwork should always come first.",2024-09-03 22:35:55
13427,deescalatory_conversation_365,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:42:55
13428,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,"I can’t believe you told Professor Li that I didn’t contribute to our project, Sam. What were you thinking?",2024-09-03 21:37:58
13429,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,"I didn’t mean to throw you under the bus, Alex. I was just stressed about our grade and panicked.",2024-09-03 21:44:58
13430,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,But now she thinks I’m lazy or something. How am I going to fix this?,2024-09-03 21:48:58
13431,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,Maybe we can both go talk to her and explain the situation properly? I’m sure she’ll understand if we’re honest.,2024-09-03 21:55:58
13432,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,"Alright, but you know I did my part. I’m just annoyed that this even happened.",2024-09-03 22:04:58
13433,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,"I get it, and I’m really sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything without talking to you first.",2024-09-03 22:06:58
13434,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,It’s okay. Let’s just focus on making it right. So we’ll talk to her after class tomorrow?,2024-09-03 22:11:58
13435,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,"Yeah, sounds good. I’ll make sure she knows how much you actually contributed.",2024-09-03 22:17:58
13436,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sam. I appreciate that.",2024-09-03 22:20:58
13437,deescalatory_conversation_366,speaker_2,"No problem, Alex. Let’s just make sure we communicate better next time.",2024-09-03 22:28:58
13438,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball when I was wide open?,2024-09-03 21:38:02
13439,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,"I didn't see you, I swear. I thought you were covered.",2024-09-03 21:45:02
13440,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,It's not the first time though. It feels like you never trust me with the ball.,2024-09-03 21:51:02
13441,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,"I understand how you feel, but I really didn't see you. Maybe we need to work on our communication.",2024-09-03 21:52:02
13442,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,"Hey, guys, let's focus on improving as a team. Arguing won't help us win.",2024-09-03 21:53:02
13443,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,I guess you're right. It's just frustrating when we keep making the same mistakes.,2024-09-03 22:00:02
13444,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,I get it. How about we call out positions louder next time? That way we can avoid missing opportunities.,2024-09-03 22:07:02
13445,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,"Yeah, that sounds fair. And I'll make sure to get in a spot where you can see me better.",2024-09-03 22:10:02
13446,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,Good plan. Let's also support each other more on the field. Too much negativity won't help us improve.,2024-09-03 22:17:02
13447,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,Agreed. We're all on the same team here. How about we practice some passing drills after the game?,2024-09-03 22:23:02
13448,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_1,That works for me. I want us to win just as much as you do.,2024-09-03 22:30:02
13449,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_3,"Perfect, let's turn this around and make sure we're all in sync for the next game.",2024-09-03 22:31:02
13450,deescalatory_conversation_367,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let’s go out there and play our best.",2024-09-03 22:36:02
13451,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,"Mark, why did you delete the shared project file without telling anyone first?",2024-09-03 21:37:05
13452,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,"I didn't think anyone was using it, Sarah. It was just cluttering up the folder.",2024-09-03 21:47:05
13453,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,But Katie and I were actively working on it. We lost a lot of progress.,2024-09-03 21:49:05
13454,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_3,"Yeah, Mark. I was updating it just yesterday. Why didn't you check with us first?",2024-09-03 21:51:05
13455,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,"I apologize, I thought it was an old version. I should have clarified before deleting it.",2024-09-03 21:54:05
13456,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,Can we find a way to recover the file? There must be a backup somewhere.,2024-09-03 22:01:05
13457,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_3,I think IT might be able to help. We should contact them immediately.,2024-09-03 22:04:05
13458,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,"I'll reach out to IT right now. Meanwhile, let's try to reconstruct what we remember.",2024-09-03 22:08:05
13459,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_1,Good idea. Can we also agree to create a separate archive folder for old versions in the future?,2024-09-03 22:10:05
13460,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_3,That sounds like a solid plan. Let's make sure this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:16:05
13461,deescalatory_conversation_368,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll be more careful and communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:18:05
13462,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,"Hey, you didn't show up for the study session yesterday, and we really needed you there.",2024-09-03 21:37:08
13463,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,"I know, I’m sorry, but I had something come up. Why didn’t you just start without me?",2024-09-03 21:47:08
13464,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,"We did start, but there were questions only you could answer. It really set us back.",2024-09-03 21:52:08
13465,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,I didn’t mean to let you guys down. What can I do to make it right?,2024-09-03 21:53:08
13466,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,We need to reschedule another session today and go over what we missed. Can you make it?,2024-09-03 21:58:08
13467,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can fit that in. What time works for everyone?",2024-09-03 22:02:08
13468,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_3,I’m available at 5 PM. Does that work for you both?,2024-09-03 22:09:08
13469,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,5 PM works for me too. We should focus on the difficult sections first.,2024-09-03 22:12:08
13470,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_2,"Agreed, let’s tackle the hard parts right away. I'll come prepared this time.",2024-09-03 22:21:08
13471,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate you stepping up. We’ll get this done together.",2024-09-03 22:26:08
13472,deescalatory_conversation_369,speaker_3,"Teamwork is where we shine, guys. Let's make this study session count.",2024-09-03 22:32:08
13473,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,I can't believe you sent that email without consulting me first!,2024-09-03 21:36:12
13474,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,"I apologized already, but I thought it was urgent and needed to be handled right away.",2024-09-03 21:43:12
13475,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,But it was a joint project! We agreed to make decisions together!,2024-09-03 21:50:12
13476,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,You're right. I should have discussed it with you first. What can we do to fix this?,2024-09-03 21:55:12
13477,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,Maybe we can send a follow-up email together to clarify and make any corrections.,2024-09-03 22:04:12
13478,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,That's a good idea. Let's draft it together right now.,2024-09-03 22:10:12
13479,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,"Okay, let's focus on explaining our main points more clearly this time.",2024-09-03 22:15:12
13480,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,Agreed. And we should also include a note that we're always available for further questions.,2024-09-03 22:16:12
13481,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I appreciate you being willing to work on this together.,2024-09-03 22:18:12
13482,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,No problem. I know how important this project is for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:24:12
13483,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,Let's make sure we communicate better moving forward to avoid misunderstandings.,2024-09-03 22:28:12
13484,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,Absolutely. Better coordination will help us reach our goals faster.,2024-09-03 22:34:12
13485,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_1,"Great. Now, let's get that follow-up email done.",2024-09-03 22:38:12
13486,deescalatory_conversation_370,speaker_2,Let's do it.,2024-09-03 22:47:12
13487,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Why did you take my phone without asking?,2024-09-03 21:33:15
13488,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,I needed to make an urgent call and my battery was dead.,2024-09-03 21:37:15
13489,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,You could have just asked me.,2024-09-03 21:40:15
13490,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,I didn't want to wake you up; it was really late.,2024-09-03 21:45:15
13491,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,"I understand, but it's important to respect each other's belongings.",2024-09-03 21:47:15
13492,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,You're right. I should have left a note or told you in the morning.,2024-09-03 21:51:15
13493,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Thanks for acknowledging that.,2024-09-03 21:55:15
13494,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,Can we figure out a better way for these situations in the future?,2024-09-03 22:02:15
13495,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Maybe we can have a place where we leave notes if something like this happens again?,2024-09-03 22:05:15
13496,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,That sounds fair. Would you be okay with that?,2024-09-03 22:06:15
13497,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,"Yes, I'm okay with that. Let's make sure we both follow it.",2024-09-03 22:12:15
13498,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,Deal. And I'm sorry for not asking first.,2024-09-03 22:14:15
13499,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let's move forward.,2024-09-03 22:15:15
13500,deescalatory_conversation_371,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:19:15
13501,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were applying to the same job?,2024-09-03 21:39:19
13502,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,"I didn't think I needed to. It's a free market, right?",2024-09-03 21:48:19
13503,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,But we always talk about these things. It feels like you went behind my back.,2024-09-03 21:58:19
13504,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to. I just thought we both had a fair shot, and I didn't want to complicate things.",2024-09-03 22:05:19
13505,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,Why didn't you just mention it? It feels dishonest.,2024-09-03 22:13:19
13506,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,You're right. I should have said something. I just didn't want it to create any tension between us.,2024-09-03 22:14:19
13507,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,"When you don't share, it creates more tension, not less.",2024-09-03 22:23:19
13508,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,I see that now. I'm sorry. Can we find a way to move forward?,2024-09-03 22:31:19
13509,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,I appreciate the apology. Maybe we can agree to be more open about these things?,2024-09-03 22:36:19
13510,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,Definitely. Our friendship is more important than any job. Let's keep the lines of communication clear.,2024-09-03 22:44:19
13511,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_1,Agreed. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:45:19
13512,deescalatory_conversation_372,speaker_2,"No problem. Let's both do our best and support each other, no matter what happens with the job.",2024-09-03 22:55:19
13513,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't tell me about the project deadline moving up, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:35:23
13514,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,"Emma, I thought you knew! It was posted in the group chat.",2024-09-03 21:39:23
13515,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,"Well, I must have missed it. But still, as my teammate, you should have made sure I was aware.",2024-09-03 21:44:23
13516,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,"I understand, but everyone is responsible for checking updates. It's not just my job to inform you.",2024-09-03 21:47:23
13517,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_3,"Guys, can we keep it cool? We need to focus on finishing the project now, not blaming each other.",2024-09-03 21:48:23
13518,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,"You're right, Liam. I'm just stressed because now we have less time, and I'm not sure how we'll manage.",2024-09-03 21:50:23
13519,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,"I get that, Emma. I'm stressed too. Let's come up with a plan to divide the work evenly.",2024-09-03 21:58:23
13520,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_3,"Okay, how about this? Alex, you handle the research. Emma, you focus on writing the draft. I'll put together the visuals and format the presentation.",2024-09-03 22:08:23
13521,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_1,"Fine, that sounds fair. But Alex, can you promise to keep me in the loop from now on?",2024-09-03 22:10:23
13522,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_2,"Of course, Emma. I'll make sure we communicate better. Let's finish this project strong.",2024-09-03 22:13:23
13523,deescalatory_conversation_373,speaker_3,"Great! Now, let's get to work and turn this around.",2024-09-03 22:21:23
13524,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_1,"Hey, can we talk about the group project for history class?",2024-09-03 21:36:26
13525,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_2,"Sure, what's up?",2024-09-03 21:46:26
13526,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_1,"I noticed you haven't added your part to the presentation slides yet, and we have to present tomorrow.",2024-09-03 21:48:26
13527,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_2,"Yeah, I've had a lot going on. I'll get it done tonight.",2024-09-03 21:57:26
13528,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_3,"It's just that we've been working on this for two weeks, and now it feels like we're scrambling.",2024-09-03 21:58:26
13529,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_2,"I know, I'm sorry about that. I should have communicated better.",2024-09-03 22:01:26
13530,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_1,"We understand things get busy, but it's important to keep everyone in the loop.",2024-09-03 22:08:26
13531,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_3,Maybe we can figure out together what still needs to be done and split it?,2024-09-03 22:09:26
13532,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_2,"That sounds fair. I think I have most of the information, I just need some help organizing it.",2024-09-03 22:15:26
13533,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_1,"Great, let's go through each slide and see how we can divide the work.",2024-09-03 22:17:26
13534,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_3,"I can help with the introduction and the conclusion. How about you, speaker_2, handle the body part, and speaker_1 can oversee the visuals?",2024-09-03 22:27:26
13535,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_2,That works for me. I'm sorry again for not handling my part sooner.,2024-09-03 22:33:26
13536,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_1,"It's fine, let's just focus on nailing this presentation.",2024-09-03 22:35:26
13537,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's meet in the library at 6 PM to finalize everything. Does that work for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:40:26
13538,deescalatory_conversation_374,speaker_2,Works for me,2024-09-03 22:50:26
13539,deescalatory_conversation_375,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you change the marketing strategy without discussing it with the team?",2024-09-03 21:32:28
13540,deescalatory_conversation_375,speaker_2,I thought it would drive more engagement. The previous strategy wasn't working.,2024-09-03 21:38:28
13541,deescalatory_conversation_375,speaker_1,But we had agreed to review the results together before making any changes.,2024-09-03 21:45:28
13542,deescalatory_conversation_375,speaker_2,"I know, but I felt we were running out of time. The campaign wasn't yielding results.",2024-09-03 21:52:28
13543,deescalatory_conversation_375,speaker_1,"I get that, but making decisions unilaterally undermines our teamwork. We could've brainstormed together for a better solution.",2024-09-03 22:00:28
13544,deescalatory_conversation_375,speaker_2,"You're right, I should've consulted everyone before acting. Can we review the new strategy together now?",2024-09-03 22:08:28
13545,deescalatory_conversation_375,speaker_1,"Yes, let's analyze the changes and see how we can improve it collaboratively.",2024-09-03 22:13:28
13546,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,"We need to talk about your performance in the group project, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:36:32
13547,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,What do you mean? I did my part.,2024-09-03 21:42:32
13548,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,But you missed the deadline for the research notes.,2024-09-03 21:47:32
13549,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,I explained I was busy with finals.,2024-09-03 21:54:32
13550,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,"We all had finals, but we still managed our tasks.",2024-09-03 21:59:32
13551,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,So you're saying I didn't try hard enough?,2024-09-03 22:08:32
13552,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,I'm saying we need better communication and accountability.,2024-09-03 22:10:32
13553,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,"Okay, I get that. But I did contribute in other ways, didn't I?",2024-09-03 22:18:32
13554,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,"Yes, your presentation slides were great. We just need to ensure we stay on track.",2024-09-03 22:19:32
13555,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,I see your point. Maybe we could set clearer deadlines next time?,2024-09-03 22:29:32
13556,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. And let's check in more frequently.,2024-09-03 22:32:32
13557,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,"Agreed, we should set up weekly progress meetings.",2024-09-03 22:35:32
13558,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,"Perfect. That way, we can avoid misunderstandings and keep the project on course.",2024-09-03 22:39:32
13559,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,Thanks for bringing this up. I didn't realize it was affecting the group this much.,2024-09-03 22:40:32
13560,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_1,No problem. We're all learning to work together better.,2024-09-03 22:42:32
13561,deescalatory_conversation_376,speaker_2,"Cool, let's make sure our next project runs smoother.",2024-09-03 22:46:32
13562,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_1,"I can't believe you left the restaurant without paying, Jeremy!",2024-09-03 21:37:35
13563,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_2,"Look, Sam, I was in a rush, and I thought you had it covered.",2024-09-03 21:42:35
13564,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_1,We agreed we'd split the bill. I feel embarrassed now.,2024-09-03 21:48:35
13565,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_2,"I get that. Next time, I'll make sure we split it before we leave.",2024-09-03 21:53:35
13566,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing won't help. Can we solve this calmly?",2024-09-03 21:54:35
13567,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_1,"Okay, sure. Jeremy, can you just pay me back for your part?",2024-09-03 22:02:35
13568,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_2,"Yeah, no problem. I'll transfer the money right now.",2024-09-03 22:08:35
13569,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Let's just be clear about it next time.",2024-09-03 22:14:35
13570,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Sam. Lesson learned.",2024-09-03 22:23:35
13571,deescalatory_conversation_377,speaker_3,Glad this got sorted out. Peace restored!,2024-09-03 22:32:35
13572,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_1,I'm really upset because you didn't show up for our group study session again.,2024-09-03 21:33:39
13573,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_2,"I know I missed it, but I had a lot going on. Why didn't you remind me?",2024-09-03 21:34:39
13574,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_1,We agreed to meet every Wednesday. I didn't think I needed to remind you.,2024-09-03 21:42:39
13575,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_2,"I get that, but sometimes a reminder would help. My week has been so busy.",2024-09-03 21:47:39
13576,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_1,"I understand you're busy, but we all are. It feels like you aren't prioritizing this study group.",2024-09-03 21:54:39
13577,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_2,It's not that I don't care. I just have trouble balancing everything. Maybe we can figure out a better system?,2024-09-03 21:56:39
13578,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_1,I'm open to that. What do you suggest we change to make it easier for you to attend?,2024-09-03 22:03:39
13579,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_2,Maybe we can set up a reminder on our phones or in a group chat the day before.,2024-09-03 22:07:39
13580,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. How about we also check in with each other in the morning of the study day?,2024-09-03 22:13:39
13581,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_2,I think that would help a lot. I appreciate you being understanding about this.,2024-09-03 22:23:39
13582,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_1,I just want us all to succeed. Let's try out these reminders and see if it helps.,2024-09-03 22:29:39
13583,deescalatory_conversation_378,speaker_2,Definitely. I'll set up the group chat reminder right now. Thanks for being patient with me.,2024-09-03 22:33:39
13584,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were planning our group presentation without me?,2024-09-03 21:33:42
13585,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_2,I thought you were too busy with your other assignments.,2024-09-03 21:35:42
13586,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_1,But I'm part of this group too. We should be making decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:45:42
13587,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_2,I didn't mean to exclude you. I just thought it would be easier this way.,2024-09-03 21:50:42
13588,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_1,Easier for whom? Now I feel completely out of the loop.,2024-09-03 21:52:42
13589,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_2,I see your point. I'm sorry about that. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:55:42
13590,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_1,Let's set up a meeting where we can all discuss our ideas and responsibilities.,2024-09-03 22:00:42
13591,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_2,That sounds fair. When are you available?,2024-09-03 22:04:42
13592,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_1,I'm free tomorrow afternoon. Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 22:08:42
13593,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_2,"Yes, that works. I'll message the others and confirm.",2024-09-03 22:14:42
13594,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_1,Great. And let's make sure we all communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:19:42
13595,deescalatory_conversation_379,speaker_2,"Agreed. We all want to do well, and that requires everyone's input.",2024-09-03 22:27:42
13596,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_1,"I can't believe you told the boss that the project was your idea, Emma.",2024-09-03 21:36:45
13597,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Jack? I never said that.",2024-09-03 21:43:45
13598,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_1,"You did! He praised you in front of everyone, and you just stood there and took credit.",2024-09-03 21:53:45
13599,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_2,"Jack, I didn't want to interrupt him in front of everyone and seem ungrateful. Besides, we've always worked on these ideas together.",2024-09-03 21:59:45
13600,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_1,It felt like you were taking all the credit. I've put in just as much effort as you.,2024-09-03 22:04:45
13601,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_2,"I understand how it can come across that way. When we're in the next meeting, I'll make sure to clarify that it was a joint effort.",2024-09-03 22:10:45
13602,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_1,"Thanks, Emma. I just wanted to make sure my work is recognized too.",2024-09-03 22:16:45
13603,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Jack. Your contribution is just as valuable as mine, and I'll make that clear. We make a great team, and it's important we both get acknowledged.",2024-09-03 22:19:45
13604,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's figure out a way to present our ideas together from now on.,2024-09-03 22:25:45
13605,deescalatory_conversation_380,speaker_2,That's a good plan. Open communication will help us avoid misunderstandings like this in the future.,2024-09-03 22:30:45
13606,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you show up for the group meeting today? We needed your input on the project.",2024-09-03 21:39:49
13607,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, sorry. I thought I sent a message to let you know.",2024-09-03 21:42:49
13608,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,I didn't see any message. Maybe it got lost. Can we just agree on a backup plan next time?,2024-09-03 21:46:49
13609,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,That's fair. How about we set up a group chat so everyone gets updates at once?,2024-09-03 21:55:49
13610,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,Good idea. Can you help set it up?,2024-09-03 22:03:49
13611,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,Sure thing. I'll get right on that after my next class.,2024-09-03 22:04:49
13612,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,"Thanks. By the way, we decided on the project outline. Do you want me to fill you in?",2024-09-03 22:11:49
13613,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,Definitely. Can you send me the notes?,2024-09-03 22:18:49
13614,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,I'll email them to you. Anything specific you wanted to contribute to the outline?,2024-09-03 22:23:49
13615,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,I was thinking about focusing on the market analysis part. Does that work for you all?,2024-09-03 22:30:49
13616,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_1,That works. We actually needed someone for that section. Glad to have you on it.,2024-09-03 22:40:49
13617,deescalatory_conversation_381,speaker_2,Perfect. I'll start researching tonight.,2024-09-03 22:49:49
13618,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"Jake, why are you always late to our band practice? We can't keep waiting for you.",2024-09-03 21:37:53
13619,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Emily. I had a lot of homework. I'll try to manage my time better next time.",2024-09-03 21:38:53
13620,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"I understand school is important, but we have a big gig coming up. We need to be more consistent.",2024-09-03 21:44:53
13621,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,You're right. I'll set reminders and make sure it doesn't happen again. Can we go over the setlist now?,2024-09-03 21:46:53
13622,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_3,"Speaking of the setlist, can we change the second song? I think “Breakaway” should come after “Eclipse”.",2024-09-03 21:49:53
13623,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"That’s a good idea, Mark. Jake, what do you think? Will that work for your solos?",2024-09-03 21:52:53
13624,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,That should be fine. I can practice the transition tonight to make sure it’s smooth.,2024-09-03 21:58:53
13625,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_3,"Thanks, Jake. Just want to make sure we are on the same page so the performance goes well.",2024-09-03 22:08:53
13626,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_1,"Agreed. Let's run through it from the top and make sure everything flows. And Jake, if you need any help managing your schedule, just let us know.",2024-09-03 22:10:53
13627,deescalatory_conversation_382,speaker_2,"I'd appreciate that, Emily. Thanks for being understanding, everyone. Let's make this gig amazing.",2024-09-03 22:13:53
13628,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't include my research in the group project presentation.,2024-09-03 21:33:56
13629,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,I didn't think it fit well with the main argument we were making.,2024-09-03 21:39:56
13630,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,You didn't even discuss it with me before making that decision!,2024-09-03 21:49:56
13631,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have consulted you. I was just trying to streamline everything.",2024-09-03 21:51:56
13632,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,"Streamlining is fine, but our project should reflect all our hard work, including mine.",2024-09-03 22:00:56
13633,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,I understand your frustration. Maybe we can find a way to incorporate your research in the conclusion?,2024-09-03 22:08:56
13634,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,"That could work, but it still feels like an afterthought.",2024-09-03 22:16:56
13635,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,How about we set up another section in the presentation that highlights your findings specifically?,2024-09-03 22:17:56
13636,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,That sounds better. I just want our project to be balanced and fair.,2024-09-03 22:27:56
13637,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,I agree. Let's meet up later today to rework a few sections and make sure your research is well-represented.,2024-09-03 22:32:56
13638,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I think this will make our project stronger.,2024-09-03 22:33:56
13639,deescalatory_conversation_383,speaker_2,Absolutely. Team effort all the way.,2024-09-03 22:35:56
13640,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,"Tim, you didn’t follow the recipe, and now the cake is ruined.",2024-09-03 21:41:59
13641,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,"Emily, I thought I could experiment a little. It’s not a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:47:59
13642,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,But it is a big deal! We promised Mom we'd bake her favorite cake for her birthday.,2024-09-03 21:55:59
13643,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. I guess I got carried away. What should we do now?",2024-09-03 22:04:59
13644,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,Let’s try to salvage what we can. Can you help me gather the ingredients again?,2024-09-03 22:06:59
13645,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,For sure. Do we still have enough flour and sugar?,2024-09-03 22:12:59
13646,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,We have enough for one more attempt. Can you measure everything exactly this time?,2024-09-03 22:19:59
13647,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’ll stick to the recipe. Can you help me with the mixing?,2024-09-03 22:24:59
13648,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,Of course. I’ll preheat the oven and get the pans ready.,2024-09-03 22:27:59
13649,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_2,"Thanks, Emily. I appreciate you giving me another chance.",2024-09-03 22:34:59
13650,deescalatory_conversation_384,speaker_1,"No problem, Tim. Let’s make sure we give Mom the best birthday cake ever.",2024-09-03 22:35:59
13651,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,"Jake, why didn't you show up for band practice? We needed you there.",2024-09-03 21:36:03
13652,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"Sophie, I had a lot of homework to catch up on. I couldn't make it.",2024-09-03 21:43:03
13653,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,"We've all got homework, but the competition is in a week! We can't afford to skip practices now.",2024-09-03 21:53:03
13654,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I just couldn't manage it this time. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 21:57:03
13655,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,"It's not just this time, Jake. You've missed a lot of practices lately. We're all working hard to give our best, and we need you to do the same.",2024-09-03 22:01:03
13656,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"I know, and I appreciate everyone's effort. I've had a tough time balancing everything, but I'm committed to improving. Maybe we can find a way to manage the practice schedule differently?",2024-09-03 22:03:03
13657,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_3,"Jake, have you thought about talking to your teachers about your workload? Maybe they can help you manage your time better so you can attend practices.",2024-09-03 22:08:03
13658,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"That's a good idea, I hadn't considered that. I'll talk to them tomorrow and see if there's any flexibility.",2024-09-03 22:17:03
13659,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_1,"Alright, Jake. Let's work together to figure this out. We all want to win this competition and we can't do it without you. Just keep us in the loop, okay?",2024-09-03 22:20:03
13660,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Sophie. Thanks for understanding. I'll communicate better from now on.",2024-09-03 22:29:03
13661,deescalatory_conversation_385,speaker_3,"Great, let’s focus on making",2024-09-03 22:32:03
13662,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"We need to talk about the presentation. It's not coming together, and the deadline is tomorrow.",2024-09-03 21:34:07
13663,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,"I know, but I'm swamped with other tasks. I thought we agreed you would handle the slides.",2024-09-03 21:38:07
13664,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_3,"Hold on, I thought Jack was responsible for the slides, not Sam.",2024-09-03 21:44:07
13665,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"No, I was working on the report. Sam, you were supposed to get the visuals done.",2024-09-03 21:50:07
13666,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,Really? I thought you were handling both. Maybe there was a miscommunication.,2024-09-03 21:57:07
13667,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_3,This is why we should have used the project management tool more consistently. There's too much overlap and confusion.,2024-09-03 22:06:07
13668,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"Agreed, but right now, we need to fix this. Sam, can you still get the slides done by tonight?",2024-09-03 22:15:07
13669,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,"It's tight, but I can manage if Jack helps me with the content. Can you do that, Jack?",2024-09-03 22:24:07
13670,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_3,"I can, but only if we clearly divide up the tasks. Let's list out what's left.",2024-09-03 22:30:07
13671,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_1,"Good idea. I'll take care of the introduction and conclusion. Sam, you handle the charts and graphs. Jack, work on the bullet points and main ideas.",2024-09-03 22:31:07
13672,deescalatory_conversation_386,speaker_2,"Alright, that sounds doable. Jack,",2024-09-03 22:40:07
13673,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were falling behind on the project, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:35:11
13674,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, Emma. I thought I could catch up.",2024-09-03 21:45:11
13675,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,"But we’re a team, and I need to know these things. We're all in this together.",2024-09-03 21:47:11
13676,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"I get that, but I didn't want to worry anyone. Plus, I thought I would stress everyone out.",2024-09-03 21:49:11
13677,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,It actually stresses me out more when I find out last minute. Can we work together to fix this now?,2024-09-03 21:56:11
13678,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have spoken up earlier. What can we do to get back on track?",2024-09-03 22:02:11
13679,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,Let’s break down the tasks and see where we can redistribute some of the workload.,2024-09-03 22:07:11
13680,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"Okay, I have the most trouble with the research part. Could you help me with that?",2024-09-03 22:17:11
13681,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,Absolutely. And maybe we can ask Jenny to help with some of the presentation slides?,2024-09-03 22:25:11
13682,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"That sounds like a good plan. I’ll talk to Jenny, and we can set a time to work on the research together.",2024-09-03 22:35:11
13683,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,Perfect. Let’s aim to meet tomorrow after class. Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 22:38:11
13684,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_2,"Yes, that works. Thanks for understanding and helping out, Emma.",2024-09-03 22:46:11
13685,deescalatory_conversation_387,speaker_1,"No problem, Alex. Remember, next time just let us know earlier. We’re here to support each",2024-09-03 22:48:11
13686,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,Why didn’t you tell me about the surprise party you were planning for Sarah?,2024-09-03 21:34:16
13687,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,"I didn't think you needed to know every detail, Carla. We wanted it to be a small surprise.",2024-09-03 21:44:16
13688,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,But I'm her best friend! I should have been involved in planning something important like this.,2024-09-03 21:47:16
13689,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,"I understand you’re close to her, but we thought it would be more fun to keep it a secret from everyone involved.",2024-09-03 21:53:16
13690,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,Keeping it from me wasn’t fun. It felt like you excluded me on purpose.,2024-09-03 21:56:16
13691,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,That wasn’t our intention at all. We just wanted to keep it manageable.,2024-09-03 22:02:16
13692,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,"Maybe, but it still hurts to be left out. If you had involved me, I could have helped make it even better.",2024-09-03 22:07:16
13693,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,"You're right. I see now how it came across that way. Next time, we’ll make sure to include you in the planning.",2024-09-03 22:09:16
13694,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,"Thanks, that means a lot. I just want to be sure we’re all on the same team and not leaving anyone out.",2024-09-03 22:10:16
13695,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,Absolutely. We value your input and should have communicated better. Let’s try to collaborate more going forward.,2024-09-03 22:12:16
13696,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_1,"Agreed. Collaboration is key. How did the party turn out, by the way?",2024-09-03 22:20:16
13697,deescalatory_conversation_388,speaker_2,"It went really well, but I think having your creative ideas would have added that special touch.",2024-09-03 22:22:16
13698,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,"Why did you submit your part of the group project so late, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:40:19
13699,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,I had a lot going on last week and underestimated the time it would take.,2024-09-03 21:44:19
13700,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,"We've all got busy schedules, but we agreed on deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:52:19
13701,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,"Yeah, we've been trying to pull our weight to get this done on time.",2024-09-03 21:56:19
13702,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,"I get it, and I'm really sorry. How can I help now to make up for it?",2024-09-03 22:02:19
13703,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,We might need you to take over some of the editing to balance things out.,2024-09-03 22:05:19
13704,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,"Also, could you double-check the references? I think that would really help.",2024-09-03 22:08:19
13705,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll focus on editing and references today. Anything else?,2024-09-03 22:15:19
13706,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,"If you can handle those tasks, I think we can finish on time as planned.",2024-09-03 22:24:19
13707,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's just communicate better next time to avoid this stress.,2024-09-03 22:33:19
13708,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_2,"Definitely, I appreciate you both understanding. I'll get to work right away.",2024-09-03 22:38:19
13709,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. Let's finish strong, team.",2024-09-03 22:40:19
13710,deescalatory_conversation_389,speaker_3,"Yeah, we can do this. Let's go over the final steps together tomorrow.",2024-09-03 22:45:19
13711,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the group project without asking us first.,2024-09-03 21:34:23
13712,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,"I had to. The deadline was approaching, and no one else was responding.",2024-09-03 21:41:23
13713,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_3,That doesn't mean you get to make all the decisions on your own.,2024-09-03 21:45:23
13714,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,Exactly. We should have discussed the final draft together.,2024-09-03 21:46:23
13715,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but I was worried we'd miss the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:52:23
13716,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_3,"How about next time we set a timeline for review, so this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 22:01:23
13717,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,"Yes, that way we can all make sure we're on the same page before submitting.",2024-09-03 22:11:23
13718,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:19:23
13719,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_3,And we should all also be more responsive to messages from the group.,2024-09-03 22:21:23
13720,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,Absolutely. Communication is key.,2024-09-03 22:22:23
13721,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_2,"Okay, let's focus on improving our collaboration for future projects.",2024-09-03 22:31:23
13722,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_3,Sounds good to me. Let's move forward and do better next time.,2024-09-03 22:40:23
13723,deescalatory_conversation_390,speaker_1,Glad we could sort this out. Let's get back to work.,2024-09-03 22:41:23
13724,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,I can't believe you sided with them during the project meeting. You're supposed to have my back.,2024-09-03 21:40:27
13725,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,"I wasn't choosing sides, I was trying to make sure we considered all perspectives. It's important for the team.",2024-09-03 21:46:27
13726,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,But it felt like you were undermining my points. We had agreed on a strategy.,2024-09-03 21:55:27
13727,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,I understand why you feel that way. Maybe we should review our original strategy and see where adjustments can be made.,2024-09-03 22:03:27
13728,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,That might help. I just want to ensure our voices are heard without being overshadowed.,2024-09-03 22:10:27
13729,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's set up another meeting to present a unified approach. We can outline our points clearly.,2024-09-03 22:15:27
13730,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,Do you really think we can come to an agreement with them? They seem so set in their ways.,2024-09-03 22:21:27
13731,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,"It might not be easy, but if we facilitate a constructive dialogue, we increase our chances. We need to understand their priorities, too.",2024-09-03 22:27:27
13732,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,Fair point. I'll draft some key points we need to address and send them to you for input.,2024-09-03 22:37:27
13733,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,Great idea. I'll add my thoughts and we can go over it together before the next meeting.,2024-09-03 22:44:27
13734,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_1,"And maybe, during the meeting, we can ask for their feedback directly. That way, they feel involved and we're not imposing our ideas.",2024-09-03 22:45:27
13735,deescalatory_conversation_391,speaker_2,"Exactly. By involving them, we create a more collaborative environment and can hopefully",2024-09-03 22:48:27
13736,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you show up for the group project meeting yesterday?",2024-09-03 21:34:31
13737,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,I had some personal stuff come up. I meant to text you guys.,2024-09-03 21:39:31
13738,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,We really needed your input on the financial planning section. Now we're behind schedule.,2024-09-03 21:47:31
13739,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,I get that. How about I take on the entire financial section to catch us up?,2024-09-03 21:57:31
13740,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,"That would help, but we still need to review what we discussed yesterday to make sure we're on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:02:31
13741,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,Can you fill me in real quick on the key points? I'll make sure to incorporate them.,2024-09-03 22:05:31
13742,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,"Sure, we decided to focus on a more conservative growth strategy. Do you think you can adjust the figures accordingly?",2024-09-03 22:15:31
13743,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll have a revised plan ready by tonight. Could you check it over once I'm done?,2024-09-03 22:25:31
13744,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,Of course. Let's also set up another meeting to discuss any adjustments.,2024-09-03 22:31:31
13745,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,Sounds good. I'll send out a Doodle poll to find a time that works for everyone.,2024-09-03 22:38:31
13746,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,I appreciate you stepping up. Thanks for understanding the urgency.,2024-09-03 22:46:31
13747,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_2,"No problem, I should've communicated better. Let's make sure our project turns out great.",2024-09-03 22:51:31
13748,deescalatory_conversation_392,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's keep the lines of communication open from here on out.,2024-09-03 22:53:31
13749,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't show up for the group project meeting yesterday.,2024-09-03 21:37:35
13750,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, and I couldn't make it. I should have told you guys earlier.",2024-09-03 21:47:35
13751,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,"I understand emergencies happen, but we really needed your input. We're falling behind.",2024-09-03 21:50:35
13752,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,"You're right, it was my responsibility to inform the group. How can I catch up on what I missed?",2024-09-03 21:54:35
13753,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_3,We discussed the structure for our presentation. I can share the notes with you and help you get up to speed.,2024-09-03 21:59:35
13754,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,"Yeah, communication is key here. We need everyone to be on the same page. Can we all agree to keep each other updated?",2024-09-03 22:00:35
13755,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’ll make sure to communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:05:35
13756,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_3,"Let’s set up a group chat, so it’s easier to reach out quickly when something comes up.",2024-09-03 22:06:35
13757,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,"Good idea. And, speaker_2, if you need help with anything specific, just let us know.",2024-09-03 22:08:35
13758,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_2,"Thanks, I appreciate it. I'll review the notes and come prepared for the next meeting.",2024-09-03 22:15:35
13759,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_3,"Great, let’s focus on moving forward and making this project successful together.",2024-09-03 22:23:35
13760,deescalatory_conversation_393,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's keep working as a team and support each other.,2024-09-03 22:27:35
13761,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,Why did you remove my lines from the screenplay without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:39:38
13762,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,I thought the scene flowed better without them.,2024-09-03 21:48:38
13763,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,But those lines were important for my character's development.,2024-09-03 21:51:38
13764,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,I understand they meant a lot to you. Can we discuss how to include that development differently?,2024-09-03 22:00:38
13765,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,I suppose we could find another way. But you should've at least let me know before making changes.,2024-09-03 22:09:38
13766,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have communicated better. Let's figure out a way to make sure your character's arc is preserved.",2024-09-03 22:10:38
13767,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Maybe we could add a monologue later in the script?",2024-09-03 22:15:38
13768,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. How about we sit down and draft something together?,2024-09-03 22:19:38
13769,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,That works for me. It would help maintain the story's balance and keep both of us on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:20:38
13770,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_2,Absolutely. We'll schedule a time to revise it this week. Teamwork is vital for a great screenplay.,2024-09-03 22:21:38
13771,deescalatory_conversation_394,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's do it. Communication from here on out is key.,2024-09-03 22:29:38
13772,deescalatory_conversation_395,**Scenario,College roommates arguing about cleanliness in their shared apartment**,2024-09-03 21:40:43
13773,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,"I can't believe you left the dishes in the sink again, Sarah!",2024-09-03 21:48:43
13774,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,"It was just one time, Mark. I've been super busy with assignments.",2024-09-03 21:58:43
13775,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,One time? This has been happening all week!,2024-09-03 21:59:43
13776,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,"Okay, maybe I’ve been a bit neglectful, but you left your laundry all over the living room last week.",2024-09-03 22:03:43
13777,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,That's different. I was running late for class and moved it later.,2024-09-03 22:12:43
13778,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,"Well, I was late to work today too. Can we just cut each other some slack?",2024-09-03 22:21:43
13779,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,It's just frustrating to come home to a mess when I've also got a busy schedule.,2024-09-03 22:27:43
13780,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,I understand. Let's figure out a better cleaning schedule that works for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:32:43
13781,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,That sounds fair. How about we both take turns every other day?,2024-09-03 22:35:43
13782,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,I can work with that. And maybe we can set a reminder for ourselves?,2024-09-03 22:39:43
13783,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,Agreed. A reminder should help us stay on track.,2024-09-03 22:41:43
13784,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_2,Thanks for bringing it up calmly. I don’t want to fight over this.,2024-09-03 22:50:43
13785,deescalatory_conversation_395,speaker_1,Me neither. I’m glad we talked about it.,2024-09-03 22:54:43
13786,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,Why didn't you include my part in the group presentation?,2024-09-03 21:40:46
13787,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,I didn't think it fit with the overall flow of our project.,2024-09-03 21:46:46
13788,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,But I spent hours working on that section. You can't just cut it out without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:51:46
13789,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,I understand you're upset. Maybe I should have discussed it with you first. Can we find a way to incorporate some of your points?,2024-09-03 21:57:46
13790,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,"Yes, we can. But I also feel like you disregard my input a lot. This isn't the first time.",2024-09-03 22:01:46
13791,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,I'm sorry you feel that way. I do value your input. Let's work together more closely next time to avoid this situation.,2024-09-03 22:07:46
13792,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,"Okay, but can we also agree on clear communication before making big decisions?",2024-09-03 22:09:46
13793,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,Absolutely. Communication is key. How about we set up regular check-ins when working on group projects?,2024-09-03 22:13:46
13794,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. Let's make sure everyone feels included and heard.,2024-09-03 22:23:46
13795,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,"Agreed. Your contributions are important, and I want to ensure we all succeed as a team.",2024-09-03 22:30:46
13796,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate that you're willing to work on this with me.,2024-09-03 22:32:46
13797,deescalatory_conversation_396,speaker_2,No problem. Let's make our presentation the best it can be together.,2024-09-03 22:40:46
13798,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,Why didn't you come to the group meeting yesterday? We really needed your input.,2024-09-03 21:33:49
13799,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I got caught up with another project. But I thought you guys could handle it.",2024-09-03 21:37:49
13800,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,We were specifically assigned to work on this presentation together. It's not fair to leave all the work to the rest of us.,2024-09-03 21:42:49
13801,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,I understand. I should have managed my time better. How can I help now?,2024-09-03 21:52:49
13802,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,We need your analysis on the market trends section. Can you get that done by tomorrow?,2024-09-03 21:54:49
13803,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I’ll prioritize it and have it ready by tomorrow. Anything else I missed?",2024-09-03 21:56:49
13804,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,We also assigned tasks for the visual elements of the slides. Would you be able to create those?,2024-09-03 22:00:49
13805,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,Sure thing. I'll start with the market trends and then move on to the visuals.,2024-09-03 22:04:49
13806,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,That would really help us get back on track. Let’s sync up again tomorrow morning to review progress?,2024-09-03 22:06:49
13807,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,"Sounds good, I’ll make sure everything is ready for the review. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:11:49
13808,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_1,Thank you for stepping up. Let's make sure we keep better communication moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:13:49
13809,deescalatory_conversation_397,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll be more proactive in keeping everyone updated.,2024-09-03 22:16:49
13810,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass the ball during the final moments of the game, Maria? We lost because of that.",2024-09-03 21:37:54
13811,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,"I didn't feel like anyone was in a good position to make the shot, okay? It was a split-second decision!",2024-09-03 21:40:54
13812,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_3,But you should have trusted us! We're a team; we could have figured it out together.,2024-09-03 21:46:54
13813,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,"I do trust you guys, but in that moment, I made a call. I thought it was the best choice.",2024-09-03 21:48:54
13814,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,"We get that, but we practice these plays all the time. Next time, can you please stick to the plan?",2024-09-03 21:51:54
13815,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,I understand. Maybe I should have relied more on the practice we've done. I'm sorry for that.,2024-09-03 21:55:54
13816,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_3,"Thanks, Maria. We just want to make sure we work together better next time.",2024-09-03 21:58:54
13817,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,I appreciate the feedback. Let's regroup and focus on how we can improve for the next game.,2024-09-03 22:00:54
13818,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,Agreed. How about we review some of those clutch scenarios in practice tomorrow?,2024-09-03 22:02:54
13819,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_3,Sounds good to me. Let's use this loss to come back stronger.,2024-09-03 22:04:54
13820,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_2,Definitely. We'll work on it and get better together. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:05:54
13821,deescalatory_conversation_398,speaker_1,No problem. We're all in this together. Let's keep pushing forward.,2024-09-03 22:08:54
13822,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,Why did you swap my notes for yours without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:35:59
13823,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,I didn't think it would be a big deal. You know how swamped I am with work right now.,2024-09-03 21:42:59
13824,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,It is a big deal. I needed those notes to complete our project on time.,2024-09-03 21:47:59
13825,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, okay? I didn't realize it would cause such a problem. Can we find a way to fix this together?",2024-09-03 21:51:59
13826,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,Maybe. Let's figure out what we're missing and how we can split the workload to catch up.,2024-09-03 21:55:59
13827,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,Great idea. I'll start by reviewing what I have and seeing where the gaps are.,2024-09-03 21:58:59
13828,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,And I'll re-create the notes from memory as best as I can. We can compare our findings afterwards.,2024-09-03 22:04:59
13829,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,"Cool, once we have a better idea, we can schedule some focused work sessions to get back on track.",2024-09-03 22:09:59
13830,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,"Agreed. And next time, please ask before swapping materials like that. Transparency matters.",2024-09-03 22:12:59
13831,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_2,I'll make sure to do that. Thanks for understanding and working with me on this.,2024-09-03 22:20:59
13832,deescalatory_conversation_399,speaker_1,Let's get started then. We'll make up the lost time together.,2024-09-03 22:21:59
13833,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took my idea and presented it as your own in the meeting, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:43:02
13834,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Sam? It was a team effort. We both worked on it.",2024-09-03 21:50:02
13835,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,"Yes, but you didn't even mention my name. It looked like it was all your work.",2024-09-03 21:52:02
13836,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,I didn't realize it came off like that. I just got caught up in the moment.,2024-09-03 21:55:02
13837,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,This isn't the first time though. It's starting to make me feel undervalued.,2024-09-03 21:57:02
13838,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,I really didn't mean to make you feel that way. How can I make it right?,2024-09-03 22:01:02
13839,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,Acknowledging my contributions in front of the team would be a good start.,2024-09-03 22:11:02
13840,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,I can definitely do that. Maybe we can even present together next time?,2024-09-03 22:19:02
13841,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,That would be much better. It would show that we work as a team.,2024-09-03 22:22:02
13842,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,Agreed. I'm sorry for the oversight. It'll be different moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:24:02
13843,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. I appreciate you listening and understanding.",2024-09-03 22:27:02
13844,deescalatory_conversation_400,speaker_2,"No problem, Sam. We're in this together.",2024-09-03 22:34:02
13845,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"I can't believe you ruined our camping trip, Jack.",2024-09-03 21:38:06
13846,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,"What? I didn't ruin anything, Sarah. The rain did.",2024-09-03 21:44:06
13847,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"No, it was you and your lack of planning. We didn't even have a proper tent!",2024-09-03 21:47:06
13848,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,I thought the weather forecast was clear. I did check it before we left.,2024-09-03 21:54:06
13849,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,Checking once isn't enough. You should have double-checked and packed extra gear.,2024-09-03 21:55:06
13850,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,"Okay, maybe I should have been more thorough. But we all agreed to go, knowing the risks.",2024-09-03 22:03:06
13851,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"We should've prepared for those risks. This isn't just about the rain. We ran out of food, too.",2024-09-03 22:11:06
13852,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,"I get it, I messed up with the supply count. But why didn't you say something before we left?",2024-09-03 22:14:06
13853,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"I trusted your judgment, thinking you had it covered. You're usually better at this.",2024-09-03 22:15:06
13854,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,Let's focus on fixing this. How about we brainstorm what we could do better next time?,2024-09-03 22:17:06
13855,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"Sure, I guess that's a start. Maybe we should make a checklist of essentials together.",2024-09-03 22:22:06
13856,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,That's a good idea. And I'll make sure to double-check the weather and pack extra supplies.,2024-09-03 22:27:06
13857,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_1,"Alright, and I'll help more with the planning phase. We can avoid these mistakes if we work together.",2024-09-03 22:33:06
13858,deescalatory_conversation_401,speaker_2,Deal. Let's make our next trip one to,2024-09-03 22:43:06
13859,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,"Why did you delete the project files, Alex? We needed those for the presentation tomorrow!",2024-09-03 21:36:11
13860,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"I didn’t mean to delete them, Sam. It was an accident. I thought I was cleaning up duplicates.",2024-09-03 21:42:11
13861,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,That doesn't help us now. We're in deep trouble because of this!,2024-09-03 21:50:11
13862,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"I understand it's a mess, but let's stay calm. We can try to recover the files from the backup.",2024-09-03 21:53:11
13863,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,What if they aren't in the backup? We might not have enough time!,2024-09-03 21:59:11
13864,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"I already checked, and they are in the backup. It'll take a bit of work, but we can restore everything.",2024-09-03 22:05:11
13865,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,"Alright, that's a relief. But we still lost valuable time because of this.",2024-09-03 22:09:11
13866,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm really sorry. Let’s split the tasks to get back on track faster. I'll handle the data recovery, and you can start on the slides prep.",2024-09-03 22:17:11
13867,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,"Okay, sounds like a plan. Let's just make sure this doesn’t happen again.",2024-09-03 22:24:11
13868,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll be more careful next time. Let's focus on doing our best for the presentation.,2024-09-03 22:34:11
13869,deescalatory_conversation_402,speaker_1,Thanks for stepping up. Let's get this done.,2024-09-03 22:37:11
13870,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass the ball in the last minute of the game. We could have tied it up!,2024-09-03 21:34:15
13871,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,I didn't see you open. I thought taking the shot myself was the best option.,2024-09-03 21:38:15
13872,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,"But you were covered, and I was right there, ready for a clear shot!",2024-09-03 21:45:15
13873,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,"I get that now, but in the moment, it seemed like the best choice.",2024-09-03 21:47:15
13874,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,Everyone needs to calm down. Yelling won’t change what happened.,2024-09-03 21:54:15
13875,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,It's just frustrating. We practice these scenarios all the time.,2024-09-03 21:57:15
13876,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,"Look, I’m sorry. I made a bad call. But it's a team effort; we all had chances to score.",2024-09-03 22:01:15
13877,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,Can we focus on how to improve for the next game? We need to work on our communication.,2024-09-03 22:02:15
13878,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,You're right. I'm just venting. We need to trust each other more during critical moments.,2024-09-03 22:08:15
13879,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,"Let's spend some extra time on passing drills this week. That way, we're all more in sync.",2024-09-03 22:14:15
13880,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,"Agreed. We should also practice more under pressure, simulating game situations.",2024-09-03 22:22:15
13881,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_1,"I can get behind that. No hard feelings, okay?",2024-09-03 22:26:15
13882,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_2,"No hard feelings. We're a team, and we’ll learn from this.",2024-09-03 22:34:15
13883,deescalatory_conversation_403,speaker_3,"Alright, let's put this behind us and focus on getting better together.",2024-09-03 22:42:15
13884,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,"Sarah, why did you delete my part of the project presentation?",2024-09-03 21:35:18
13885,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,"I didn't delete it, Jake. I just moved it around because it didn't fit with the flow.",2024-09-03 21:40:18
13886,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,But you didn't even ask me before making changes!,2024-09-03 21:44:18
13887,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,I'm sorry about that. I thought it would be okay since we were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:51:18
13888,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,You should have at least let me know. I worked hard on that section.,2024-09-03 22:00:18
13889,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,"I understand, and I apologize. Can we take a look at it together and find a way to include your work?",2024-09-03 22:09:18
13890,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I just want to make sure we're both happy with the final presentation.,2024-09-03 22:16:18
13891,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's sit down and go through it. Your input is really valuable.,2024-09-03 22:22:18
13892,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate you being willing to go over it.",2024-09-03 22:28:18
13893,deescalatory_conversation_404,speaker_2,"No problem, Jake. Let's make this project the best it can be.",2024-09-03 22:36:18
13894,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,Why did you delete the files from the project folder? We needed those for our presentation.,2024-09-03 21:40:22
13895,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,I didn't delete them on purpose. I thought they were old versions we no longer needed.,2024-09-03 21:47:22
13896,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,You should have double-checked with the team before doing that. Now we're behind schedule.,2024-09-03 21:54:22
13897,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,I get it. I'm sorry. How can we fix this together?,2024-09-03 22:03:22
13898,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,Maybe we can check if there are backups available. Did you save any copies on your personal drive?,2024-09-03 22:04:22
13899,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,"I have some versions from last week. They might not be the latest, but it's a start.",2024-09-03 22:14:22
13900,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,"Alright, let’s retrieve those and see what we can salvage. We might need to rework some parts quickly.",2024-09-03 22:19:22
13901,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,"Sure, I'll get those versions right away, and then we can distribute the tasks to catch up.",2024-09-03 22:27:22
13902,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,And let’s set up a clearer file management system moving forward to prevent this from happening again.,2024-09-03 22:32:22
13903,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,Agreed. Maybe we can designate one person to manage the final versions?,2024-09-03 22:34:22
13904,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,That’s a good idea. We can discuss it with everyone in the next meeting.,2024-09-03 22:44:22
13905,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_2,Thanks for being willing to work this out. Let’s get those files and move forward.,2024-09-03 22:45:22
13906,deescalatory_conversation_405,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let’s tackle this and ensure our presentation is still top-notch.,2024-09-03 22:46:22
13907,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,I don't understand why you didn't pass me the ball during the last play.,2024-09-03 21:43:26
13908,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"I didn't see an open lane, and I thought it was too risky.",2024-09-03 21:53:26
13909,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,But I was wide open! We could have scored and tied the game!,2024-09-03 21:54:26
13910,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"I know, maybe I made the wrong call, but I was under pressure and made a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:59:26
13911,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,We need to communicate better on the court. This keeps happening where we're not on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:01:26
13912,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"You're right, we do need better communication. What can we do to improve it?",2024-09-03 22:07:26
13913,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,How about we practice some drills that focus on passing and decision-making under pressure?,2024-09-03 22:16:26
13914,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,"Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. We could also review our plays together before the game.",2024-09-03 22:21:26
13915,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's set up a time after practice to go over some strategies. I think it will help us work more efficiently as a team.,2024-09-03 22:23:26
13916,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,Sounds good. Thanks for bringing this up. Let's make sure we all get on board with this plan.,2024-09-03 22:26:26
13917,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,Definitely. I'll talk to the coach about adding it to our practice routine.,2024-09-03 22:35:26
13918,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_2,Great. I'm looking forward to improving our teamwork. We can do better next time.,2024-09-03 22:37:26
13919,deescalatory_conversation_406,speaker_1,"For sure, let's give it our all.",2024-09-03 22:38:26
13920,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,"I saw the grade on your math test, Alex. What happened?",2024-09-03 21:35:31
13921,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,"I don't know, Mom. It was just really hard.",2024-09-03 21:36:31
13922,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,"But you told me you studied for it, didn't you?",2024-09-03 21:44:31
13923,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,I did study. I just don't get some of the new stuff we're learning.,2024-09-03 21:54:31
13924,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,Have you considered asking your teacher for extra help?,2024-09-03 21:59:31
13925,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,"I thought about it, but I wasn't sure if he'd have time.",2024-09-03 22:03:31
13926,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,"I'm sure he'd be willing to help if you ask. Did you try any other resources, like online tutorials?",2024-09-03 22:05:31
13927,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,Not really. I just stuck to what we had in the textbook.,2024-09-03 22:13:31
13928,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,Maybe we can look for some videos together this evening. How does that sound?,2024-09-03 22:23:31
13929,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,"Yeah, I guess that could help.",2024-09-03 22:30:31
13930,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,"Also, let's make a plan for you to review a little each day. That way, it won't seem so overwhelming.",2024-09-03 22:36:31
13931,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_2,"Okay. I'll give it a shot. Thanks for understanding, Mom.",2024-09-03 22:43:31
13932,deescalatory_conversation_407,speaker_1,"Of course. I know you can do this, Alex. We'll figure it out together.",2024-09-03 22:48:31
13933,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,"Hey, we need to talk about your part in the group project.",2024-09-03 21:43:35
13934,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,What do you mean? I've been working on it.,2024-09-03 21:48:35
13935,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,Your research seems a bit lacking and it's affecting our progress.,2024-09-03 21:54:35
13936,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,"Come on, I did my best with the time I had. It's not like you guys are perfect either.",2024-09-03 21:55:35
13937,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_3,Maybe we can help each other out here. What specifically is missing from the research?,2024-09-03 21:56:35
13938,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,It's mostly the data analysis. Your section doesn't have the needed depth.,2024-09-03 22:03:35
13939,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,"Okay, but I didn't get the detailed guidelines from anyone. How was I supposed to know?",2024-09-03 22:05:35
13940,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_3,"That's fair. Let's make sure we're all on the same page, and maybe divide parts we can do together.",2024-09-03 22:13:35
13941,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,"Right, I think we can all pitch in a bit more. It's not solely on you, it's a team effort.",2024-09-03 22:16:35
13942,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,"Alright, so what needs to be added to make it better?",2024-09-03 22:26:35
13943,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_3,We need more statistical analysis and a section on potential limitations.,2024-09-03 22:29:35
13944,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,Got it. Can you both guide me through the statistics part?,2024-09-03 22:39:35
13945,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_1,"Sure thing. I'll handle the data sources, and we can go through it together.",2024-09-03 22:47:35
13946,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_3,"And I can help with writing up the limitations part. Teamwork makes the dream work, right?",2024-09-03 22:50:35
13947,deescalatory_conversation_408,speaker_2,"Thanks, I appreciate it. Let's make this",2024-09-03 22:53:35
13948,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me that you were feeling this way about the group project?,2024-09-03 21:38:41
13949,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,I didn't want to cause a scene and make things worse for everyone.,2024-09-03 21:43:41
13950,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,But keeping quiet isn't helping either. We all need to be on the same page.,2024-09-03 21:53:41
13951,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,"I get that, it's just difficult bringing up issues like this. I thought I could handle it on my own.",2024-09-03 22:03:41
13952,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,I understand. Maybe we could come up with a way to share concerns more openly so none of us have to deal with things alone.,2024-09-03 22:12:41
13953,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,That sounds good. Maybe we could have a time at the end of each meeting to discuss any worries or problems we're having.,2024-09-03 22:15:41
13954,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,I think that's a great idea. It would help us catch issues early and support each other better.,2024-09-03 22:22:41
13955,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,Agreed. I'm sorry for not speaking up sooner. I just didn't want to be a burden.,2024-09-03 22:29:41
13956,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,You're not a burden. We all have to look out for each other. Let's make sure we all feel comfortable sharing from now on.,2024-09-03 22:38:41
13957,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,That means a lot. Thanks for understanding. I'll try to be more open in the future.,2024-09-03 22:43:41
13958,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,"Good. And if any one of us is feeling overwhelmed or uncertain, let's commit to addressing it together.",2024-09-03 22:45:41
13959,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_2,"Absolutely. We're a team, and teams work best when everyone is heard and supported.",2024-09-03 22:52:41
13960,deescalatory_conversation_409,speaker_1,Exactly.,2024-09-03 23:00:41
13961,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,"Hey, Jamie, can we talk about the group project?",2024-09-03 21:37:45
13962,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,"Sure, what's up?",2024-09-03 21:39:45
13963,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,I noticed you haven't been contributing much to the document.,2024-09-03 21:45:45
13964,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,I've been busy with other assignments. But I've been trying to catch up.,2024-09-03 21:53:45
13965,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,"I get that everyone's busy, but we agreed to split the work evenly. It's not fair to the rest of us.",2024-09-03 22:02:45
13966,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,You're right. I should've managed my time better. How can I make it up?,2024-09-03 22:10:45
13967,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,"How about you take on the research section? It needs some work, and you're good at that.",2024-09-03 22:13:45
13968,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,That sounds doable. I'll start on it tonight.,2024-09-03 22:19:45
13969,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,"Thanks, that would help a lot. Also, let's set up a check-in meeting mid-week.",2024-09-03 22:24:45
13970,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,Great idea. We can review what we've done and what's left.,2024-09-03 22:33:45
13971,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,Awesome. I'll send out a calendar invite.,2024-09-03 22:43:45
13972,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_2,Perfect. Thanks for bringing this up calmly.,2024-09-03 22:53:45
13973,deescalatory_conversation_410,speaker_1,No problem. Let's nail this project!,2024-09-03 23:00:45
13974,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my report from the shared drive, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:39:49
13975,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"I didn't delete it, Sam. I moved it to the ""Completed"" folder. Didn't you see my message?",2024-09-03 21:45:49
13976,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"No, I didn't see any message. I spent hours looking for it.",2024-09-03 21:49:49
13977,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,I'm sorry you had to go through that. I should have double-checked that you saw the message.,2024-09-03 21:52:49
13978,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"It's just so frustrating, Alex. I had to rewrite everything.",2024-09-03 22:02:49
13979,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"I understand, and I'm really sorry. Let's make sure we have a better system for communicating changes. Maybe we can use a shared calendar?",2024-09-03 22:10:49
13980,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. I think we need clearer notifications too.,2024-09-03 22:19:49
13981,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,Agreed. Would email notifications work for you every time we move files?,2024-09-03 22:25:49
13982,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,"Yes, that would help a lot. Thanks for being understanding, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:26:49
13983,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,"No problem, Sam. We both want the project to go smoothly. Let's keep each other in the loop better from now on.",2024-09-03 22:27:49
13984,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,Absolutely. I think this will improve our workflow a lot.,2024-09-03 22:29:49
13985,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_2,Me too. Let's make sure to communicate clearly going forward.,2024-09-03 22:33:49
13986,deescalatory_conversation_411,speaker_1,Deal. Thanks for working this out with me.,2024-09-03 22:35:49
13987,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,"We need to talk about the project presentation, Danny.",2024-09-03 21:35:54
13988,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,"Yeah, Sarah. I know it's been a mess.",2024-09-03 21:42:54
13989,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,What happened with your slides? They were supposed to cover the financial analysis.,2024-09-03 21:44:54
13990,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,"I know, I messed up. I couldn't get the data verified in time.",2024-09-03 21:49:54
13991,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me sooner? We could've worked something out together.,2024-09-03 21:56:54
13992,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,I didn't want to stress you more. You've been so overloaded.,2024-09-03 21:59:54
13993,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, but it would've been better for us to communicate. Now we're both stuck fixing this last minute.",2024-09-03 22:03:54
13994,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,You're right. I should've said something. How do you think we can salvage this?,2024-09-03 22:07:54
13995,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,Let's split the remaining work. I can verify the financial data if you handle the visuals.,2024-09-03 22:14:54
13996,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'll get started on the visuals right away.,2024-09-03 22:15:54
13997,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,And let's check in with each other every hour to make sure we're on track.,2024-09-03 22:16:54
13998,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for being understanding about it. We'll get this done.,2024-09-03 22:20:54
13999,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_1,"No worries. We're a team, after all. Let's make it the best we can.",2024-09-03 22:25:54
14000,deescalatory_conversation_412,speaker_2,Absolutely. We've got this.,2024-09-03 22:29:54
14001,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,"Why did you take my laptop without asking, Jamie? I needed it for my presentation.",2024-09-03 21:39:57
14002,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,"I thought you wouldn't mind, Alex. You usually let me borrow your stuff.",2024-09-03 21:45:57
14003,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,But you know how important this presentation is to me. You could have at least asked.,2024-09-03 21:50:57
14004,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,You're right. I should've asked first. I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause any trouble.,2024-09-03 21:58:57
14005,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,It's not just about the laptop. It's about respecting each other's space and property.,2024-09-03 22:03:57
14006,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,I understand that now. How can I make it up to you?,2024-09-03 22:07:57
14007,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,"Maybe, next time just ask before taking something. And help me finish my presentation?",2024-09-03 22:16:57
14008,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,"Sure, I'd be happy to help. What do you need done?",2024-09-03 22:22:57
14009,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,I need help with fine-tuning the slides and rehearsing the key points.,2024-09-03 22:25:57
14010,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,"Got it. Let's start with the slides, and then we can practice together.",2024-09-03 22:28:57
14011,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jamie. I appreciate that you're willing to help.",2024-09-03 22:35:57
14012,deescalatory_conversation_413,speaker_2,"No problem, Alex. Let's make sure your presentation is perfect.",2024-09-03 22:44:57
14013,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,"Why did you miss practice again, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:43:02
14014,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework, coach. I couldn't make it.",2024-09-03 21:49:02
14015,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,Homework shouldn't be an excuse. You need to balance both.,2024-09-03 21:50:02
14016,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"I know, but this week has been especially tough.",2024-09-03 21:59:02
14017,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_3,"Alex, we all have homework too and we still make it to practice.",2024-09-03 22:02:02
14018,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"I get it, Jordan, but everyone's workload is different.",2024-09-03 22:05:02
14019,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,Maybe we can find a way to manage your time better so you can still come to practice.,2024-09-03 22:15:02
14020,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"That would be helpful, actually. I don't want to let the team down.",2024-09-03 22:21:02
14021,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_3,"Yeah, we just want to make sure everyone's putting in the same effort.",2024-09-03 22:31:02
14022,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,I understand. I'll try harder to organize my time.,2024-09-03 22:36:02
14023,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_1,Good. Let's talk after practice about creating a schedule that works for you.,2024-09-03 22:39:02
14024,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,"Thanks, coach. I appreciate it.",2024-09-03 22:49:02
14025,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_3,"We're all in this together, Alex. Just let us know if you need help.",2024-09-03 22:52:02
14026,deescalatory_conversation_414,speaker_2,I will. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:56:02
14027,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,Why did you change the presentation slides without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:40:06
14028,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,I thought it would make them look more professional. I didn't think you would mind.,2024-09-03 21:43:06
14029,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,But you removed some important data and now it looks confusing.,2024-09-03 21:50:06
14030,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,I apologize if that caused any issues. Could we look at it together and find a compromise?,2024-09-03 21:58:06
14031,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,I appreciate that. Maybe we can combine both of our ideas to make it work better?,2024-09-03 22:04:06
14032,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,"Yes, that sounds like a good plan. Let's meet after lunch and discuss the changes in detail.",2024-09-03 22:05:06
14033,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,"Alright, I’ll bring both versions of the slides so we can compare them.",2024-09-03 22:12:06
14034,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,Perfect. We'll make sure it has both the professional look and the necessary data.,2024-09-03 22:13:06
14035,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I'm sure we can sort this out.,2024-09-03 22:23:06
14036,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,Absolutely. Working together will definitely improve the presentation.,2024-09-03 22:27:06
14037,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_1,"Okay then, I'll see you after lunch.",2024-09-03 22:33:06
14038,deescalatory_conversation_415,speaker_2,See you then.,2024-09-03 22:35:06
14039,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,"Tommy, you can't just take the last piece of cake without asking!",2024-09-03 21:40:08
14040,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,"I didn't think anyone else wanted it, Mom.",2024-09-03 21:50:08
14041,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,"Well, you should have asked first. It's about consideration for everyone else.",2024-09-03 22:00:08
14042,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_3,It's not a big deal. I wasn't going to eat it anyway.,2024-09-03 22:02:08
14043,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,"That's not the point, Lily. It's about being respectful.",2024-09-03 22:05:08
14044,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,"I understand, Mom. I'll ask next time.",2024-09-03 22:12:08
14045,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,"Thank you, Tommy. That's all I'm asking for.",2024-09-03 22:18:08
14046,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,Can we just make sure there's more cake next time?,2024-09-03 22:28:08
14047,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_3,"Yeah, maybe we could all bake together!",2024-09-03 22:37:08
14048,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. Let's make it a family activity.,2024-09-03 22:39:08
14049,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_2,Deal. Sorry for not asking this time.,2024-09-03 22:42:08
14050,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_3,"It's okay, Tommy. No hard feelings.",2024-09-03 22:47:08
14051,deescalatory_conversation_416,speaker_1,"Alright then, let's move on and have a good evening.",2024-09-03 22:52:08
14052,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,We need to talk about what happened during the science fair project.,2024-09-03 21:44:13
14053,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,What's there to talk about? You completely took over and ignored my ideas.,2024-09-03 21:49:13
14054,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"I didn't mean to take over, I just thought we were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:58:13
14055,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,But you didn't even ask for my input. I felt like I wasn't part of the team.,2024-09-03 22:01:13
14056,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"That wasn't my intention at all. I really value your ideas, and I'm sorry if it felt that way.",2024-09-03 22:06:13
14057,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,It just makes me think that you don't trust my abilities.,2024-09-03 22:11:13
14058,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"That's not true. I do trust you, and I can see now that I should have communicated better.",2024-09-03 22:15:13
14059,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,Maybe we can find a way to balance our contributions better next time?,2024-09-03 22:21:13
14060,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,"Absolutely. Your ideas are important, and I want to make sure we both have an equal say.",2024-09-03 22:28:13
14061,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,Thanks for saying that. Let's make a plan to work more collaboratively in future projects.,2024-09-03 22:31:13
14062,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,Sounds like a good idea. Let's set some clear roles and always check in with each other before making decisions.,2024-09-03 22:37:13
14063,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_2,Deal. I think that will make our work stronger and more enjoyable.,2024-09-03 22:45:13
14064,deescalatory_conversation_417,speaker_1,Agreed. I'm glad we talked about this. Let's move forward as a better team.,2024-09-03 22:54:13
14065,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for our group project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:43:17
14066,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"I had something come up, okay? Why are you making such a big deal out of it?",2024-09-03 21:48:17
14067,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,"Because it's important! We're already behind schedule, and your absence makes it harder for us to catch up.",2024-09-03 21:52:17
14068,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"Well, you could have just texted me the details. I can catch up on my own time.",2024-09-03 22:02:17
14069,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,It's not just about catching up. We need to discuss things together to make sure we're on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:06:17
14070,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"I get that, but sometimes things come up. It's not like I did it on purpose.",2024-09-03 22:16:17
14071,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,"Look, I understand that emergencies happen. But can you at least let us know next time?",2024-09-03 22:23:17
14072,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can do that. I'm sorry for not communicating better.",2024-09-03 22:31:17
14073,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. We just really need everyone's input to make this project work.",2024-09-03 22:41:17
14074,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"Okay, let's set another meeting time so we can get back on track.",2024-09-03 22:46:17
14075,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,Sounds good. How about tomorrow at 5 p.m.? Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 22:54:17
14076,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,"Yeah, that works. I'll make sure to be there.",2024-09-03 22:58:17
14077,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_1,Great. Let's move forward and finish this project strong.,2024-09-03 23:04:17
14078,deescalatory_conversation_418,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 23:09:17
14079,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,Why were you out past curfew last night?,2024-09-03 21:40:21
14080,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,"I was at the library studying, Mom. You can check my notes.",2024-09-03 21:41:21
14081,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"Your grades have been slipping, so forgive me if I'm skeptical.",2024-09-03 21:42:21
14082,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,"I know my grades aren't great, but that's why I was studying. I need to improve.",2024-09-03 21:47:21
14083,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,I'm worried because this isn't the first time you've broken curfew.,2024-09-03 21:48:21
14084,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,"I understand, but I was really trying to catch up on my studies. Staying late was necessary.",2024-09-03 21:56:21
14085,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,Is there something going on that's making it hard for you to keep up during regular hours?,2024-09-03 22:00:21
14086,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,It's just been a heavy workload. I'm struggling to keep up with everything.,2024-09-03 22:02:21
14087,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"Okay, let's find a solution together. Would it help if we set up a study schedule that doesn't keep you out so late?",2024-09-03 22:05:21
14088,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,That might work. I could really use some help organizing my time better.,2024-09-03 22:14:21
14089,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,I'm here to support you. Let's sit down and make this plan so you can improve your grades and still follow curfew.,2024-09-03 22:22:21
14090,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_2,"Thanks, Mom. I appreciate that.",2024-09-03 22:24:21
14091,deescalatory_conversation_419,speaker_1,"We'll get through this together. Just keep communicating with me, and we'll find a way.",2024-09-03 22:26:21
14092,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"Why did you cancel the rehearsal without telling me, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:37:26
14093,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Jenna, I couldn't avoid it. An emergency came up at work.",2024-09-03 21:38:26
14094,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,You should have sent a message at least. We all were waiting.,2024-09-03 21:46:26
14095,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,"I know, I really should have. I didn't think it through in the moment.",2024-09-03 21:56:26
14096,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"This isn't the first time it's happened. It's affecting the entire band, you know?",2024-09-03 22:04:26
14097,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,"You're right, and I don’t want to keep letting everyone down. How can I make it up to you all?",2024-09-03 22:10:26
14098,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,It'd help if you’re more consistent with communication. Maybe set a reminder to send updates?,2024-09-03 22:15:26
14099,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'll start doing that immediately.,2024-09-03 22:21:26
14100,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"Okay. And if you know early on there's a conflict, let us know. We can adjust the schedule if we have to.",2024-09-03 22:28:26
14101,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,Definitely. I'll do my best to be more proactive about it.,2024-09-03 22:32:26
14102,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,"Alright. We all depend on each other, and I know you want this to work just as much as we do.",2024-09-03 22:42:26
14103,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,"Absolutely. I really appreciate your understanding, Jenna.",2024-09-03 22:52:26
14104,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_1,Let's move forward and make sure our next rehearsal goes smoothly.,2024-09-03 22:57:26
14105,deescalatory_conversation_420,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks again for being open about this.,2024-09-03 23:07:26
14106,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were going to quit the band, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:42:30
14107,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, Jamie. I just lost interest.",2024-09-03 21:49:30
14108,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,But it is a big deal to us! We depend on you for the upcoming concert.,2024-09-03 21:52:30
14109,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"Look, I didn't want to hold you guys back. I felt like I wasn’t contributing.",2024-09-03 21:56:30
14110,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_3,We could have discussed it as a group instead of you just deciding on your own.,2024-09-03 22:03:30
14111,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,I'm sorry if it seemed abrupt. I thought you all would manage without me.,2024-09-03 22:05:30
14112,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,"It's not just about managing, Alex. It's about feeling blindsided by your decision.",2024-09-03 22:11:30
14113,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,I can see your point. Maybe I should have brought it up earlier.,2024-09-03 22:14:30
14114,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_3,Exactly. We could have planned for it and maybe even found a way to re-engage your interest.,2024-09-03 22:19:30
14115,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,"I appreciate that, but my mind's pretty made up. Can I help find a replacement?",2024-09-03 22:25:30
14116,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_1,That would be really helpful. We just want to make sure we can still give a good performance.,2024-09-03 22:33:30
14117,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,I know a couple of good musicians. I'll reach out to them and see if they're interested.,2024-09-03 22:38:30
14118,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_3,"Thanks, Alex. And in the future, can we agree to communicate more about big decisions like this?",2024-09-03 22:46:30
14119,deescalatory_conversation_421,speaker_2,Definitely. I didn’t mean to cause any stress.,2024-09-03 22:48:30
14120,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you changed the project deadline?,2024-09-03 21:36:34
14121,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,I thought you knew; it was in the email I sent last week.,2024-09-03 21:45:34
14122,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,I didn't see that email. You should have reminded me in person.,2024-09-03 21:54:34
14123,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I assumed everyone checked their emails regularly.",2024-09-03 22:00:34
14124,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,"Well, now we're behind schedule, and I have no idea how we're going to catch up.",2024-09-03 22:05:34
14125,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,Can we review what needs to be done and divide the tasks to make up for lost time?,2024-09-03 22:06:34
14126,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,That could work. Let's outline the sections we need to finish first.,2024-09-03 22:15:34
14127,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,Great. I can start on the research part if you handle the presentation slides.,2024-09-03 22:25:34
14128,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,"Okay, I'll get on that. How about we meet up tomorrow to see where we stand?",2024-09-03 22:35:34
14129,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,"Sounds good. Let's aim for 3 PM, does that work?",2024-09-03 22:41:34
14130,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,"Yeah, 3 PM works for me. Thanks for sorting this out.",2024-09-03 22:51:34
14131,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_2,No problem. Let's make sure we communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:57:34
14132,deescalatory_conversation_422,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's get this done.,2024-09-03 23:02:34
14133,deescalatory_conversation_423,Setting,A group of college roommates arguing about household chores.,2024-09-03 21:36:38
14134,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"You never clean the kitchen, Matt. It's always a mess when you're in charge.",2024-09-03 21:40:38
14135,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,"I do clean the kitchen, Sarah. Maybe not right away, but I get to it.",2024-09-03 21:42:38
14136,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_3,"Look, guys, we need to figure this out. Our place is a disaster, and we're all getting frustrated.",2024-09-03 21:47:38
14137,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"We all agreed on the chore schedule, Matt. You can't just ignore it.",2024-09-03 21:50:38
14138,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,"I'm not ignoring it, Sarah. I just have a different timetable. We all have busy schedules.",2024-09-03 21:57:38
14139,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_3,How about we adjust the chore schedule so it fits everyone's routine better?,2024-09-03 22:00:38
14140,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"That might work. What do you think, Matt?",2024-09-03 22:02:38
14141,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,"Yeah, I'm open to that. Maybe we can each choose specific times that work for us.",2024-09-03 22:10:38
14142,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_3,"Let's all sit down and set clear times that we can commit to, then.",2024-09-03 22:13:38
14143,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,And we need to stick to it this time. No more excuses.,2024-09-03 22:15:38
14144,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to clean the kitchen at the designated time.,2024-09-03 22:17:38
14145,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_3,Great. It sounds like we're on the same page now. Let's try to keep each other accountable.,2024-09-03 22:21:38
14146,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_1,"Thanks for being willing to adjust, Matt. This will make things easier for everyone.",2024-09-03 22:29:38
14147,deescalatory_conversation_423,speaker_2,"No problem, Sarah. Let's do our best to keep",2024-09-03 22:36:38
14148,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball during that last play.,2024-09-03 21:43:43
14149,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, I was trying to make a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:50:43
14150,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,"You never see me, it's like you always ignore my plays on purpose.",2024-09-03 21:53:43
14151,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"That's not true, you're a crucial part of the team. I just got caught up in the moment.",2024-09-03 21:57:43
14152,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,"Well, it sure doesn't feel like it when we're losing because of bad communication.",2024-09-03 22:03:43
14153,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"You're right, our communication could definitely be better. Let's figure out how to fix that.",2024-09-03 22:04:43
14154,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,Maybe we need more practice on reading each other’s signals during the game.,2024-09-03 22:11:43
14155,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"Good idea, we could come up with some hand signals or specific calls to use.",2024-09-03 22:19:43
14156,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,"And we should watch our game tapes together, analyze where we miss opportunities.",2024-09-03 22:22:43
14157,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"I agree, plus we can see where we did well and build on that too.",2024-09-03 22:25:43
14158,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,"Exactly. We're all in this together, we just need to get on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:28:43
14159,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"Right, let's make sure everyone is on board with these new strategies.",2024-09-03 22:37:43
14160,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,"For sure, let's talk to the rest of the team and set up a meeting after practice.",2024-09-03 22:47:43
14161,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_2,"Sounds good. Thanks for bringing this up, we needed to address it.",2024-09-03 22:57:43
14162,deescalatory_conversation_424,speaker_1,No problem. I'm just glad we're working towards a solution,2024-09-03 23:01:43
14163,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,Why did you change the code without telling any of us?,2024-09-03 21:41:47
14164,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,I didn't think it would be a big deal. The bug needed to be fixed.,2024-09-03 21:49:47
14165,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,But how are we supposed to stay on the same page if we don't communicate?,2024-09-03 21:58:47
14166,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_3,"Exactly, we can't just make changes without discussing them first.",2024-09-03 22:06:47
14167,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,"I understand that, but the deadline is approaching, and I thought this would be quicker.",2024-09-03 22:14:47
14168,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,"I get the urgency, but we need to maintain consistency in our process.",2024-09-03 22:16:47
14169,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_3,Maybe we should establish a protocol for urgent fixes to avoid this in the future.,2024-09-03 22:25:47
14170,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,"Yeah, that sounds reasonable. I'm sorry for not consulting with you guys first.",2024-09-03 22:27:47
14171,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,Apology accepted. How about we draft that protocol now so we're all clear going forward?,2024-09-03 22:36:47
14172,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,Sounds good to me. Let's make sure this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:40:47
14173,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_3,"Agreed. Teamwork means coordinating our efforts, even under pressure.",2024-09-03 22:43:47
14174,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_1,"Okay, let's set up a quick meeting and write down the steps for urgent fixes.",2024-09-03 22:53:47
14175,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_2,Great—I'll make sure to communicate better from now on. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:54:47
14176,deescalatory_conversation_425,speaker_3,"Thanks, everyone. Let's get back on track and finish this project smoothly.",2024-09-03 23:00:47
14177,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't tell me about the due date change for the group project, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:42:51
14178,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,"I thought you knew, Mia! It was announced in class. Didn't you see the email from Professor Thompson?",2024-09-03 21:49:51
14179,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,"No, I didn't. My email's been acting up and I missed it. You should have mentioned it in our group chat.",2024-09-03 21:57:51
14180,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,"I get that, but everyone else seemed to know. I assumed you did too. Why didn't you ask someone else?",2024-09-03 22:04:51
14181,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,"I just didn't think it would change. It's really important to communicate these things, especially since we're all in this together.",2024-09-03 22:11:51
14182,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,You're right. I should have double-checked with everyone. I'm sorry for not doing that.,2024-09-03 22:17:51
14183,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,Thanks. I just feel really stressed about this project. Can we make sure to keep each other updated from now on?,2024-09-03 22:19:51
14184,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's set up a dedicated project timeline in our group chat so everyone stays informed.,2024-09-03 22:29:51
14185,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_3,"Hey, guys, I overheard you. I missed the email too. Can we post any class announcements directly in the chat from now on?",2024-09-03 22:39:51
14186,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. It'll prevent misunderstandings and keep everyone on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:48:51
14187,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll start by posting the new due date and any other important details right now.,2024-09-03 22:53:51
14188,deescalatory_conversation_426,speaker_3,"Thanks, Alex. This will really help all",2024-09-03 22:54:51
14189,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for practice today?,2024-09-03 21:39:55
14190,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,I had a lot of homework to do. I didn't think it would be a big deal.,2024-09-03 21:44:55
14191,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,We've talked about this before. The team relies on everyone being there.,2024-09-03 21:46:55
14192,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,"I know, but school is important too. I couldn't let my grades slip.",2024-09-03 21:53:55
14193,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,"I get that, but you could have at least told us you weren't coming.",2024-09-03 22:02:55
14194,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have sent a message or something.",2024-09-03 22:05:55
14195,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,Communication is key if we want to succeed. We're all counting on each other.,2024-09-03 22:15:55
14196,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,I understand. It won't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:16:55
14197,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's work together to balance school and practice better.,2024-09-03 22:26:55
14198,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,Agreed. I appreciate you talking to me about it instead of just getting angry.,2024-09-03 22:35:55
14199,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,"We're a team, and we all make mistakes. Let's move forward from this.",2024-09-03 22:44:55
14200,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,"Sounds good. I'll see you at the next practice, no excuses.",2024-09-03 22:53:55
14201,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,Great. Let's prepare to win our next game.,2024-09-03 23:03:55
14202,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_2,Definitely. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 23:07:55
14203,deescalatory_conversation_427,speaker_1,Anytime. We're here to support each other.,2024-09-03 23:12:55
14204,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,Why did you change the code without telling me? The whole program crashed during the demo!,2024-09-03 21:43:59
14205,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,I didn't think it would cause an issue. I was trying to fix a bug.,2024-09-03 21:50:59
14206,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,But you should have communicated with the team. We all needed to be aware of the changes.,2024-09-03 21:56:59
14207,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,"I get that now, but I didn't think it was a big deal at the time.",2024-09-03 22:04:59
14208,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_3,Can we all just take a step back and figure out how to avoid this in the future?,2024-09-03 22:08:59
14209,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,"Sure, but we need a better way to communicate changes. This can't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:18:59
14210,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,Agreed. Maybe we can implement a protocol for code changes and updates?,2024-09-03 22:22:59
14211,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_3,That sounds like a good idea. Any suggestions on what the protocol should include?,2024-09-03 22:26:59
14212,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,How about a mandatory review and a Slack notification for every significant change?,2024-09-03 22:34:59
14213,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,That works. And maybe a quick standup meeting if the change is substantial?,2024-09-03 22:38:59
14214,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_3,Excellent idea. Let's write this down and make sure we all follow it from now on.,2024-09-03 22:39:59
14215,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_1,"Alright, let’s get this documented. I think this will help us avoid similar issues moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:49:59
14216,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for working through this together, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:57:59
14217,deescalatory_conversation_428,speaker_3,No problem. Teamwork is important. Let's nail it next time.,2024-09-03 23:06:59
14218,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,Why did you turn in the project without my input?,2024-09-03 21:36:04
14219,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,"I thought you weren't available, so I had to finish it on my own.",2024-09-03 21:39:04
14220,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,"I was available, but you didn't even try to contact me.",2024-09-03 21:45:04
14221,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,"I messaged you a couple of times, but you didn't respond.",2024-09-03 21:53:04
14222,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,I didn't see any messages from you.,2024-09-03 22:03:04
14223,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,Maybe they got lost somehow. Should we review how we manage our communication?,2024-09-03 22:09:04
14224,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,That would be helpful. Recognizing each other's availability is important.,2024-09-03 22:14:04
14225,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,Agreed. We could set specific times to check in next time?,2024-09-03 22:18:04
14226,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,"Yes, that would prevent confusion. Also, let's decide together on final versions before submitting.",2024-09-03 22:27:04
14227,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,"Sure, that’s fair. We need to agree on all aspects of the project.",2024-09-03 22:34:04
14228,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,I appreciate that. Working together is key to our success.,2024-09-03 22:40:04
14229,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,Definitely. We're stronger when we collaborate effectively.,2024-09-03 22:45:04
14230,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,"Alright, let's plan a brief meeting after class tomorrow to discuss improvements.",2024-09-03 22:52:04
14231,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,Sounds good. I'll set a reminder so we don't forget.,2024-09-03 23:00:04
14232,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_1,"Perfect, I'm glad we talked this through.",2024-09-03 23:09:04
14233,deescalatory_conversation_429,speaker_2,Me too. Let's make the next project even better together.,2024-09-03 23:13:04
14234,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just missed that easy goal, Jamie. We've been practicing for months!",2024-09-03 21:44:07
14235,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,"Look, Alex, I know I messed up, but yelling at me isn't going to change anything.",2024-09-03 21:47:07
14236,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,"I understand that, but we were so close to winning. It's frustrating!",2024-09-03 21:49:07
14237,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,"I get it, I'm frustrated too. But maybe we can figure out what went wrong together?",2024-09-03 21:51:07
14238,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_3,"Hey, both of you calm down. Blaming isn't going to help us improve. What can we do to ensure we don't miss chances like that again?",2024-09-03 21:55:07
14239,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,"You're right. Jamie, do you think there was something specific that threw you off?",2024-09-03 22:00:07
14240,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,"Honestly, I think I lost focus for a moment. Maybe we need some drills that help us maintain focus under pressure?",2024-09-03 22:08:07
14241,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_3,That's a good idea. Why don't we ask Coach if we can add those drills to our practice?,2024-09-03 22:18:07
14242,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_1,"Yeah, that would be helpful. Jamie, I'm sorry for snapping at you. I know you're trying your best.",2024-09-03 22:26:07
14243,deescalatory_conversation_430,speaker_2,"Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it. Let's work together to get better.",2024-09-03 22:35:07
14244,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball, Sarah. We could've easily won the game.",2024-09-03 21:41:12
14245,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,"Jake, I didn't see you were open. The defense was all over me, and I had to make a split-second decision.",2024-09-03 21:49:12
14246,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,"But it's not the first time, Sarah. This keeps happening, and it's frustrating.",2024-09-03 21:51:12
14247,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but remember, we're a team. Mistakes happen, and we need to trust each other to make the best call in the moment.",2024-09-03 21:53:12
14248,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,Maybe you're right. I'm just tired of losing because of small mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:56:12
14249,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,"And I am too, but focusing on what went wrong won't help us improve. Let's figure out how we can communicate better on the court.",2024-09-03 21:58:12
14250,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,"How about we have more practices and work on our signals? That way, we'd both know when we're open.",2024-09-03 22:03:12
14251,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,That's a great idea. We could also try watching some of our game footage to see where we can improve our teamwork.,2024-09-03 22:11:12
14252,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,Agreed. Watching the footage would help us identify patterns and work on our weaknesses.,2024-09-03 22:15:12
14253,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,Let's set up a meeting with the coach to discuss this. It might benefit the whole team.,2024-09-03 22:19:12
14254,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_1,"Sounds good. Sorry for snapping at you earlier, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:22:12
14255,deescalatory_conversation_431,speaker_2,"It's alright, Jake. We're passionate about winning, and that's understandable. Let's turn this frustration into something positive",2024-09-03 22:29:12
14256,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you delete my code from the project repository?",2024-09-03 21:40:15
14257,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was going in the right direction, so I removed it. We can always redo it later if needed.",2024-09-03 21:47:15
14258,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,You could have at least talked to me first. I've spent hours working on that.,2024-09-03 21:57:15
14259,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,I understand. Maybe I should have consulted you. I apologize.,2024-09-03 22:00:15
14260,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,I just feel like my work isn’t being valued.,2024-09-03 22:08:15
14261,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,That's not my intention at all. How can we fix this together?,2024-09-03 22:11:15
14262,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,Maybe next time we could review changes together before making them official?,2024-09-03 22:16:15
14263,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,That sounds like a fair solution. We can set up a meeting to discuss significant changes beforehand.,2024-09-03 22:25:15
14264,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,Great. I just want to make sure our efforts are coordinated.,2024-09-03 22:35:15
14265,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,"Agreed. Your contributions are important, and I appreciate them.",2024-09-03 22:44:15
14266,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's try to communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:46:15
14267,deescalatory_conversation_432,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's get back on track and make this project a success.,2024-09-03 22:52:15
14268,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,"Could you explain why you missed practice again, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:41:19
14269,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework, Coach. I couldn't make it.",2024-09-03 21:50:19
14270,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,But this isn't the first time. The team is suffering because of this.,2024-09-03 21:56:19
14271,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,"I understand, but my grades are important too.",2024-09-03 21:59:19
14272,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,"We all have responsibilities, but commitment to the team is also important.",2024-09-03 22:00:19
14273,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,"I'm trying to balance both, but it's getting really tough.",2024-09-03 22:02:19
14274,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,Have you thought about managing your time differently or seeking help?,2024-09-03 22:05:19
14275,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,"Honestly, I haven't. Do you have any suggestions?",2024-09-03 22:11:19
14276,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,Maybe setting a stricter schedule or talking to your teachers might help.,2024-09-03 22:20:19
14277,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,That could work. I guess I could give it a try.,2024-09-03 22:30:19
14278,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,"We believe in your potential, Alex, but we need you to be here.",2024-09-03 22:31:19
14279,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,I don't want to let the team down. I'll work on my schedule.,2024-09-03 22:35:19
14280,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_1,I'm glad to hear that. Let's work together to make this happen.,2024-09-03 22:43:19
14281,deescalatory_conversation_433,speaker_2,"Thanks for understanding, Coach. I'll make sure to do better.",2024-09-03 22:46:19
14282,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you decided to change our project's topic without consulting me first?,2024-09-03 21:40:23
14283,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,I thought it would be better this way since we were running out of time to make decisions.,2024-09-03 21:43:23
14284,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,But we're supposed to be partners. We need to make these choices together.,2024-09-03 21:50:23
14285,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I was worried we'd miss the deadline if we kept debating.",2024-09-03 21:59:23
14286,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,You can't just make decisions for both of us. It's not fair!,2024-09-03 22:00:23
14287,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,You're right. I should have talked to you first. Can we figure out a way to move forward from here?,2024-09-03 22:06:23
14288,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,"Yeah, we need to. So, can you explain why you thought the new topic was better?",2024-09-03 22:10:23
14289,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,I felt it aligned more with our strengths and had more available research. But I'd really like to hear your thoughts on it too.,2024-09-03 22:20:23
14290,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,"Okay, that makes sense. I just wish we had weighed those pros and cons together.",2024-09-03 22:26:23
14291,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_2,"How about we go through the main points now, and if we're on the same page, we can proceed with the new topic. If not, we'll discuss alternatives.",2024-09-03 22:34:23
14292,deescalatory_conversation_434,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Let's get started.,2024-09-03 22:44:23
14293,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,Why did you go behind my back and change the report without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:39:26
14294,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,I didn't mean to go behind your back; I thought we agreed that it needed revisions.,2024-09-03 21:43:26
14295,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,"We agreed, but we were supposed to do it together. I feel blindsided by your changes.",2024-09-03 21:52:26
14296,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,I can see how that might upset you. I made the changes because the deadline was close and I thought I was helping.,2024-09-03 21:58:26
14297,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,But some of the data you altered was crucial. Now it doesn't reflect what we initially found.,2024-09-03 22:04:26
14298,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,I didn't realize the importance of those sections. Let's go through them now and fix what's wrong.,2024-09-03 22:13:26
14299,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,"Okay, I appreciate that. Next time, can we make sure to communicate better about such significant changes?",2024-09-03 22:17:26
14300,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I will make sure to include you in the loop. Let's work through this together and get it right.",2024-09-03 22:27:26
14301,deescalatory_conversation_435,speaker_1,Sounds good. Thank you for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:28:26
14302,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"I can't believe you skipped our study session again, Jesse.",2024-09-03 21:43:31
14303,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"Look, Sarah, I'm really sorry but I had an emergency come up last minute.",2024-09-03 21:50:31
14304,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"This has been happening too often. Our project deadline is next week, and we can't afford any more setbacks.",2024-09-03 21:53:31
14305,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"I understand, and I promise I'll make it up to you. Can we schedule another session tomorrow?",2024-09-03 21:59:31
14306,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"We've tried rescheduling before, and it hasn't worked out. How can I trust you'll show up this time?",2024-09-03 22:06:31
14307,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"I know I've been unreliable, but I really want us to do well. How about we study at my place so I can't skip?",2024-09-03 22:12:31
14308,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,That might work. But we also need to divide the remaining tasks more evenly. I've been carrying most of the workload.,2024-09-03 22:22:31
14309,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"You're right, that's not fair. I'll take on more of the research portion. How does that sound?",2024-09-03 22:24:31
14310,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,That works for me. Let's also make sure to communicate better if something comes up. Use the group chat.,2024-09-03 22:31:31
14311,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"Agreed. From now on, if anything changes, I'll let you know immediately. I'm committed to finishing this project strong.",2024-09-03 22:41:31
14312,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jesse. I appreciate it. Let's get back on track and nail this project.",2024-09-03 22:50:31
14313,deescalatory_conversation_436,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Sarah. We'll make it happen.",2024-09-03 22:58:31
14314,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,"Why did you touch my lab equipment without asking, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:42:34
14315,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"I didn’t think it would be a big deal, Tom. I just needed to borrow a beaker.",2024-09-03 21:49:34
14316,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,But you know we have a system for sharing equipment. It's there for a reason.,2024-09-03 21:53:34
14317,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"I understand, but I was in a hurry and I didn't think one beaker would cause such an issue.",2024-09-03 21:57:34
14318,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,It's not just about the beaker. It’s about communication and respecting each other’s space.,2024-09-03 22:02:34
14319,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"Okay, I get that now. How can I make it up to you?",2024-09-03 22:10:34
14320,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,Just make sure to ask before borrowing anything next time. It will help us avoid misunderstandings.,2024-09-03 22:18:34
14321,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll definitely ask in the future. I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused.,2024-09-03 22:19:34
14322,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate you understanding where I'm coming from.",2024-09-03 22:22:34
14323,deescalatory_conversation_437,speaker_2,"Sure thing, Tom. Let's get back to our projects and make sure this doesn’t happen again.",2024-09-03 22:29:34
14324,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,"Why did you borrow my laptop without asking, Jason?",2024-09-03 21:36:36
14325,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"Sorry, Emily. I really needed it to finish my project last night.",2024-09-03 21:38:36
14326,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,"You could have asked me first, though. It’s my personal stuff.",2024-09-03 21:48:36
14327,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"I know, I messed up. I didn’t think it would bother you this much.",2024-09-03 21:58:36
14328,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,It’s not just about borrowing. It’s about respecting each other’s belongings.,2024-09-03 22:00:36
14329,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,"You're right. Next time, I’ll ask before taking anything.",2024-09-03 22:06:36
14330,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,Thank you. I’d appreciate that. Just remember to treat my things as if they were yours.,2024-09-03 22:12:36
14331,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_2,Got it. And I'll try to make it up to you somehow.,2024-09-03 22:21:36
14332,deescalatory_conversation_438,speaker_1,That’s nice of you. Let’s just make sure we communicate better in the future.,2024-09-03 22:25:36
14333,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,"I can't believe you took the client meeting without even telling me, John.",2024-09-03 21:42:39
14334,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"Look, Sarah, I didn't think it was a big deal. You were busy with another project.",2024-09-03 21:45:39
14335,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,But I was preparing for that meeting all week. It was crucial for me to be there.,2024-09-03 21:53:39
14336,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"I get that, but I thought handling it myself would save us some time.",2024-09-03 21:57:39
14337,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,"Communication is key, John. We need to coordinate better. This affects the whole team.",2024-09-03 21:58:39
14338,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"You're right, Sarah. I should have let you know. How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 22:01:39
14339,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,Maybe we should implement a shared calendar for all important meetings and deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:10:39
14340,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. I'll set it up and we can go over it together.,2024-09-03 22:19:39
14341,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_1,"Thanks, John. I appreciate you understanding my side. Let's make sure we're on the same page moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:23:39
14342,deescalatory_conversation_439,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Sarah. We're a team, and better communication will only make us stronger.",2024-09-03 22:26:39
14343,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the team meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:38:43
14344,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,I thought you already knew. The coach mentioned it during practice last week.,2024-09-03 21:41:43
14345,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,I missed that practice because I was sick. You should have told me.,2024-09-03 21:48:43
14346,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,I honestly forgot. Can we find a way to make sure it doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 21:52:43
14347,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,"Sure, but this isn't the first time. I feel like I'm always out of the loop.",2024-09-03 22:00:43
14348,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,I get that. Let's set up a group chat where we can remind each other.,2024-09-03 22:07:43
14349,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,That could help. But we need everyone to be responsible for updating it.,2024-09-03 22:11:43
14350,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll bring it up at the next practice. Maybe we can assign a rotating person to send reminders.,2024-09-03 22:14:43
14351,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,That works for me. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:22:43
14352,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_2,No problem. We're a team. We need to stick together and communicate better.,2024-09-03 22:27:43
14353,deescalatory_conversation_440,speaker_1,"Yeah, you're right. We can do this.",2024-09-03 22:28:43
14354,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,"Why did you take my art supplies without asking, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:41:46
14355,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"I needed them for my school project, Bobby. I thought you'd understand.",2024-09-03 21:45:46
14356,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,But you didn’t ask me first. I was going to use them too.,2024-09-03 21:46:46
14357,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"I know, and I’m sorry. I should’ve asked. Do you still need them?",2024-09-03 21:48:46
14358,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,"Yes, I have an important assignment due tomorrow. Now I’m behind.",2024-09-03 21:58:46
14359,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,Let’s figure this out. What do you need to finish your project?,2024-09-03 22:04:46
14360,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,I need the markers and the sketchbook. Can I have them back now?,2024-09-03 22:11:46
14361,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,"Absolutely. And if you want, I can help you with your project to make up for it.",2024-09-03 22:19:46
14362,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,That would be great. I think we can still manage to finish on time.,2024-09-03 22:24:46
14363,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,Cool. I’ll make sure to always ask next time I need something.,2024-09-03 22:32:46
14364,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. Let’s focus on getting this done together.",2024-09-03 22:37:46
14365,deescalatory_conversation_441,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s get to work.,2024-09-03 22:40:46
14366,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,Why didn’t you tell me the project deadline was moved up?,2024-09-03 21:43:50
14367,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,I thought you already knew. It was announced in the team meeting.,2024-09-03 21:48:50
14368,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,"I missed that meeting because of an emergency, and I wasn’t informed afterward.",2024-09-03 21:54:50
14369,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,I’m sorry about that. I should have updated you.,2024-09-03 21:58:50
14370,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,"Now we're behind schedule, and I feel like we’re scrambling.",2024-09-03 22:08:50
14371,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,I understand. How about we prioritize tasks and delegate them more efficiently to catch up?,2024-09-03 22:14:50
14372,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,That sounds sensible. Can you outline what needs immediate attention?,2024-09-03 22:21:50
14373,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,"Sure, I’ll share the updated project timeline and key tasks we should focus on.",2024-09-03 22:28:50
14374,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,"Great, I’ll rally the team and let’s make sure we communicate more effectively moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:33:50
14375,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s also set up brief check-ins to ensure everyone is on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:35:50
14376,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_1,"Okay, let’s do that. Thanks for acknowledging the issue and working with me.",2024-09-03 22:42:50
14377,deescalatory_conversation_442,speaker_2,No problem. We’ll get through this together.,2024-09-03 22:49:50
14378,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't finish your part of the project, Sam.",2024-09-03 21:45:53
14379,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,"I know, Julia, but I've been overwhelmed with other classes. I didn't mean to let you down.",2024-09-03 21:50:53
14380,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,"We've all got other classes, but we agreed on this deadline together.",2024-09-03 21:54:53
14381,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,"You're right, and I should have communicated better. How can we fix this?",2024-09-03 21:59:53
14382,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,We need to present tomorrow. Can you handle the data analysis tonight?,2024-09-03 22:06:53
14383,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,"Yes, absolutely. I'll stay up if I have to. Can you help summarize the findings?",2024-09-03 22:07:53
14384,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,"Sure, I'll work on the summary. Let's set a time to review everything in the morning.",2024-09-03 22:09:53
14385,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,How about 7 AM? We can go through it together before class.,2024-09-03 22:18:53
14386,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_1,"That works. Thanks for stepping up, Sam.",2024-09-03 22:25:53
14387,deescalatory_conversation_443,speaker_2,"Thanks for understanding, Julia. We'll get this done.",2024-09-03 22:27:53
14388,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't include my part in the project report, Jamie.",2024-09-03 21:44:56
14389,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was relevant, Sam. Your section was too technical.",2024-09-03 21:51:56
14390,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,But the technical aspect is crucial for our presentation! How are we going to explain the process?,2024-09-03 21:52:56
14391,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,"I just thought if we kept it simple, it would be easier for the audience to understand.",2024-09-03 22:00:56
14392,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,"Maybe, but now our report feels incomplete. The technical details are important, and they support our findings.",2024-09-03 22:06:56
14393,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,I see your point. We want to be thorough. Should we try to merge the technical aspects without making it too complex?,2024-09-03 22:16:56
14394,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,"Yeah, that could work. Perhaps we can include a simplified version of the technical part and provide additional detail if asked.",2024-09-03 22:21:56
14395,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,That sounds reasonable. Let's go through your section together and find a balance.,2024-09-03 22:29:56
14396,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,Thanks for being open to this. I just want us to do a good job and not miss out on important information.,2024-09-03 22:36:56
14397,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,I get that. A strong presentation will reflect well on both of us. Let's start revising it now.,2024-09-03 22:38:56
14398,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_1,"Perfect, I’ll grab my notes and we can get started.",2024-09-03 22:44:56
14399,deescalatory_conversation_444,speaker_2,"Great, looking forward to this collaboration.",2024-09-03 22:45:56
14400,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,"I saw you took my lunch from the fridge again, Chris.",2024-09-03 21:46:00
14401,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,"What? No, I didn't take your lunch, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:56:00
14402,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,"It had my name on it, and I know it's not the first time.",2024-09-03 21:57:00
14403,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,"Look, maybe someone else took it. It's not like I keep track of everyone's lunches.",2024-09-03 22:01:00
14404,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,"But every time my lunch goes missing, you have a similar meal. It just seems suspicious.",2024-09-03 22:11:00
14405,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,"Okay, I admit, I might have mistaken it for mine once before. But I didn't do it this time.",2024-09-03 22:13:00
14406,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,"So, you did take it before? That's not okay, Chris. You can't just take people's stuff.",2024-09-03 22:17:00
14407,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,"I understand, and I'm sorry for that. It was a mistake. How can we make sure this doesn’t happen again?",2024-09-03 22:18:00
14408,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,Maybe we could label our stuff more clearly or create a separate space for each of our lunches.,2024-09-03 22:26:00
14409,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I’ll make sure to respect your space from now on.,2024-09-03 22:27:00
14410,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_1,"Thanks, Chris. I appreciate that. Let's just be more careful in the future.",2024-09-03 22:34:00
14411,deescalatory_conversation_445,speaker_2,"Agreed, Sarah. I'll keep an eye out for anything that could be yours, and if I see something suspicious, I'll let you know.",2024-09-03 22:39:00
14412,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were struggling with the project, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:41:04
14413,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"I thought I could handle it on my own, but it got out of hand, Jenna.",2024-09-03 21:44:04
14414,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,"We agreed to work as a team, remember? You shouldn't have kept it to yourself.",2024-09-03 21:51:04
14415,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. I was embarrassed to admit I was falling behind.",2024-09-03 21:52:04
14416,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,"I understand that, but keeping it a secret only made things worse. We could have fixed it together.",2024-09-03 22:00:04
14417,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"You're right. Next time, I'll be more open about my difficulties.",2024-09-03 22:02:04
14418,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,"Alright, let's focus on finding a solution now. Can you show me where you're stuck?",2024-09-03 22:08:04
14419,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"Sure, it's mostly the coding part. I just can't seem to debug this section.",2024-09-03 22:16:04
14420,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,Let's look at it together then. Two heads are better than one.,2024-09-03 22:25:04
14421,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,"Thanks, Jenna. I appreciate your help. I won't let this happen again.",2024-09-03 22:29:04
14422,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,"We're a team, Sam. We'll get through this as long as we communicate.",2024-09-03 22:38:04
14423,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's get back on track and finish this project strong.,2024-09-03 22:43:04
14424,deescalatory_conversation_446,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let's make it happen.,2024-09-03 22:51:04
14425,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,"Carlos, you were supposed to finalize the project report yesterday. What happened?",2024-09-03 21:37:07
14426,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,"Look, Maya, I just didn't get around to it. I had a lot on my plate.",2024-09-03 21:42:07
14427,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,But we agreed on the deadline together. You could have at least informed me if you couldn't manage it.,2024-09-03 21:52:07
14428,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,"I get it, but your constant reminders weren't helping. They just added more pressure.",2024-09-03 21:53:07
14429,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,"Okay, maybe I was a bit too pushy. But we need to figure out a way to finish this now. Can we set a new deadline?",2024-09-03 21:55:07
14430,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,"Yes, let's do that. How about we aim to complete it by tomorrow evening?",2024-09-03 22:05:07
14431,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,Tomorrow evening works for me. Can you handle the data analysis while I compile the rest?,2024-09-03 22:06:07
14432,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,Sounds good. I can take care of the data analysis. Should we check in around noon to make sure we're on track?,2024-09-03 22:15:07
14433,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,Noon check-in is a great idea. Let's also decide which sections need the most focus.,2024-09-03 22:16:07
14434,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,I'll review the notes and make a list by tomorrow morning so we can prioritize.,2024-09-03 22:26:07
14435,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_1,"That sounds perfect. Thanks, Carlos. I'm sure we can get this done together.",2024-09-03 22:33:07
14436,deescalatory_conversation_447,speaker_2,"Thanks for understanding, Maya. Let's make this report the best it can be.",2024-09-03 22:42:07
14437,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,Why did you submit the group project without consulting any of us?,2024-09-03 21:46:11
14438,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,I didn't think I needed to. We've been working on it together all along.,2024-09-03 21:53:11
14439,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_3,But we had agreed to review the final draft together before sending it in!,2024-09-03 21:54:11
14440,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,"I understand that, but I was worried about the deadline. I didn't want us to lose marks for being late.",2024-09-03 21:59:11
14441,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,Rushing it isn't an excuse. Did you at least go over what we discussed in our last meeting?,2024-09-03 22:09:11
14442,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,"Yes, I included all the main points we agreed on.",2024-09-03 22:12:11
14443,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_3,"Still, you should have double-checked. We could have made some final tweaks.",2024-09-03 22:21:11
14444,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,You're right. I acted impulsively. How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 22:26:11
14445,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,Let's set a reminder for all of us to meet and review before final submission next time.,2024-09-03 22:30:11
14446,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_3,Agreed. And maybe we can set multiple checkpoints before the deadline to ensure we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:36:11
14447,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just trying to be efficient.,2024-09-03 22:46:11
14448,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_1,Apology accepted. Let's focus on fixing any mistakes in the project feedback we get.,2024-09-03 22:49:11
14449,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_3,"Yes, and let's make a better plan for our next project to avoid this kind of stress.",2024-09-03 22:51:11
14450,deescalatory_conversation_448,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for understanding. I appreciate it.,2024-09-03 23:00:11
14451,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you already submitted the group project?,2024-09-03 21:38:15
14452,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,I thought you knew it was due today. What's the big deal?,2024-09-03 21:39:15
14453,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,The big deal is that we didn't go over the final version together. What if there were mistakes?,2024-09-03 21:48:15
14454,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,"Well, I reviewed it and didn't see any obvious errors. We've been working on it for weeks.",2024-09-03 21:57:15
14455,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,"That’s true, but you know I wanted to double-check everything before we turned it in.",2024-09-03 22:05:15
14456,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,"Ok, I understand that. Can you tell me exactly what you wanted to review?",2024-09-03 22:06:15
14457,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,I wanted to make sure the citations were correctly formatted and that we addressed all the required points.,2024-09-03 22:08:15
14458,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,"I see. I've double-checked the citations, but I can show you the document again so you can look it over.",2024-09-03 22:10:15
14459,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,That would help. Maybe next time we can set a final review meeting?,2024-09-03 22:20:15
14460,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,Good idea. Let’s schedule a final check-in before any submission in the future.,2024-09-03 22:24:15
14461,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that.",2024-09-03 22:34:15
14462,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_2,"No problem. Teamwork, right?",2024-09-03 22:39:15
14463,deescalatory_conversation_449,speaker_1,Teamwork.,2024-09-03 22:49:15
14464,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"I saw the test results, Kyle. You didn't do so well. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:39:19
14465,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Ms. Brown. I just had a lot going on at home and couldn't focus.",2024-09-03 21:40:19
14466,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,I understand that things can get tough sometimes. Is there anything specific affecting you?,2024-09-03 21:49:19
14467,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"Yeah, my parents have been arguing a lot lately, and it's been hard to concentrate.",2024-09-03 21:58:19
14468,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,That sounds really stressful. Have you talked to them about how it's impacting you?,2024-09-03 22:07:19
14469,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"No, I don't think they'd listen. They're too wrapped up in their own issues.",2024-09-03 22:17:19
14470,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"It's important they know how this is affecting you. But meanwhile, how can we make sure this doesn't impact your grades further?",2024-09-03 22:23:19
14471,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,I guess I could use some help catching up on the material I missed.,2024-09-03 22:30:19
14472,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,We can arrange that. Would after-school tutoring sessions work for you?,2024-09-03 22:33:19
14473,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,"Yeah, I think that could help a lot. Thank you, Ms. Brown.",2024-09-03 22:36:19
14474,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_1,"Absolutely, Kyle. Let's tackle this together. You're not alone in this.",2024-09-03 22:43:19
14475,deescalatory_conversation_450,speaker_2,I appreciate it. I'll do my best to catch up.,2024-09-03 22:50:19
14476,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't finish the marketing presentation on time.,2024-09-03 21:44:23
14477,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,I told you I needed more data from the sales team before I could finalize it.,2024-09-03 21:45:23
14478,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,But you didn't tell me that until the last minute. How am I supposed to plan around that?,2024-09-03 21:53:23
14479,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I should have communicated that earlier. Can we figure out how to make up for lost time?,2024-09-03 21:56:23
14480,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,"I guess we can, but it's going to be tough to catch up now. Do you have any ideas?",2024-09-03 22:00:23
14481,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,Maybe we can delegate some sections to other team members to speed things up?,2024-09-03 22:05:23
14482,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,That might work. I'll see who can take on extra tasks. What about the data? Is it ready now?,2024-09-03 22:13:23
14483,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,"Yes, I got it this morning. I'll integrate it into the presentation right away.",2024-09-03 22:23:23
14484,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,"Alright, let's divide the work and aim to have a draft by tomorrow afternoon. Agreed?",2024-09-03 22:26:23
14485,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to keep you updated on my progress this time.,2024-09-03 22:31:23
14486,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's work together on this and make sure it turns out great.,2024-09-03 22:34:23
14487,deescalatory_conversation_451,speaker_2,Definitely. We'll get it done.,2024-09-03 22:39:23
14488,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you change the group presentation topic without asking us?",2024-09-03 21:37:27
14489,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,I thought it would be better this way. The old topic felt too boring.,2024-09-03 21:45:27
14490,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,But we all agreed on the original topic. It wasn't up to you alone to change it.,2024-09-03 21:51:27
14491,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,"Yeah, we were all supposed to have a say in it.",2024-09-03 21:55:27
14492,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,"I understand, but I felt that if we did something more engaging, our presentation would stand out.",2024-09-03 22:04:27
14493,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,We could have discussed it though. Just making the switch like that feels disrespectful to our work.,2024-09-03 22:14:27
14494,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,Exactly. We need to work as a team and communicate better.,2024-09-03 22:16:27
14495,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. What if we meet in the middle? We can try to merge some elements from both topics.",2024-09-03 22:17:27
14496,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. We should definitely incorporate everyone's ideas.,2024-09-03 22:24:27
14497,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's schedule a meeting tonight to go over the changes together.,2024-09-03 22:34:27
14498,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,Perfect. I'm sorry for the unilateral decision. It won't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:44:27
14499,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's just make sure we're all on the same page moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:50:27
14500,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,"Yeah, let's focus on making this a great presentation together.",2024-09-03 23:00:27
14501,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_2,Absolutely. Looking forward to working more cohesively from now on.,2024-09-03 23:03:27
14502,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_1,"Great, see you both at the meeting tonight.",2024-09-03 23:08:27
14503,deescalatory_conversation_452,speaker_3,See you,2024-09-03 23:12:27
14504,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"Why did you delete the project files, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:40:33
14505,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,"I didn't delete them, Karen! They were gone when I logged in this morning.",2024-09-03 21:50:33
14506,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,It's hard to believe you since you were the last person to work on them.,2024-09-03 21:52:33
14507,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,"I understand why you'd think that, but I swear I didn't do it. Could it have been another team member?",2024-09-03 22:02:33
14508,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_3,"Hey, I just heard what happened. I didn't delete them, but can we check the activity logs to see what happened?",2024-09-03 22:12:33
14509,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"Good idea, Alex. Let's do that and see if we can find any clues.",2024-09-03 22:22:33
14510,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,"Thanks, Alex. I really didn't mean to cause any trouble, Karen.",2024-09-03 22:25:33
14511,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,I was just frustrated because we've worked so hard on this project. Let's check those logs and figure out our next steps.,2024-09-03 22:28:33
14512,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_3,Here are the logs. It shows that a system update was performed last night. Maybe that caused the issue?,2024-09-03 22:35:33
14513,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,That makes sense. Should we contact IT to see if they can restore the files from a backup?,2024-09-03 22:39:33
14514,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"Yes, let's do that right away. Thanks for helping calm things down, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:47:33
14515,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_3,No problem. We're all in this together. I'll call IT now.,2024-09-03 22:54:33
14516,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_2,"Karen, I'm sorry for any misunderstandings. Let's make sure this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:59:33
14517,deescalatory_conversation_453,speaker_1,"Agreed, Sam. Thanks for",2024-09-03 23:01:33
14518,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,Why did you change the presentation slides without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:43:35
14519,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,I thought we agreed that they needed to be more engaging.,2024-09-03 21:46:35
14520,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,"We did discuss that, but we didn't finalize any changes.",2024-09-03 21:55:35
14521,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,I see where you're coming from. I should have checked with you before making the alterations.,2024-09-03 21:56:35
14522,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,I appreciate that. What was your vision for the new slides?,2024-09-03 22:05:35
14523,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,I wanted them to have a more visual impact. I added more images and simplified the text.,2024-09-03 22:09:35
14524,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,That does sound like it could make things better. Can we go through them together?,2024-09-03 22:17:35
14525,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's make sure we're both on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:26:35
14526,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,"Great. Going forward, let's just make sure we check in with each other before making big changes.",2024-09-03 22:33:35
14527,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,Agreed. Teamwork is all about collaboration and clear communication.,2024-09-03 22:38:35
14528,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_1,Exactly. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:47:35
14529,deescalatory_conversation_454,speaker_2,No problem. Let's make this presentation the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:49:35
14530,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,"Tim, why didn't you pass the ball to me in the last quarter? I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:41:39
14531,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,"Lisa, I didn't see you. I thought I had a clear shot.",2024-09-03 21:50:39
14532,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,"But you missed, and it cost us the game. This keeps happening.",2024-09-03 22:00:39
14533,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,"I understand you're frustrated. I missed a crucial shot, and I'm sorry about that.",2024-09-03 22:04:39
14534,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,"It's not just about the shot, Tim. It's about teamwork. We aren't working together.",2024-09-03 22:07:39
14535,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,You're right. Maybe we need to focus more on communication during practice.,2024-09-03 22:13:39
14536,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,Agreed. We should discuss strategies and make sure everyone knows their role.,2024-09-03 22:22:39
14537,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. Let's set up a team meeting to talk it through.,2024-09-03 22:31:39
14538,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,"Good idea. And next time, just keep your head up and look for the pass, alright?",2024-09-03 22:38:39
14539,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for bringing this up, Lisa. Let's work on it together.",2024-09-03 22:40:39
14540,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_1,"Thanks for understanding, Tim. We'll get better as a team if we keep this up.",2024-09-03 22:41:39
14541,deescalatory_conversation_455,speaker_2,Looking forward to our next practice. Let's make sure we nail it this time.,2024-09-03 22:44:39
14542,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't tell me about the project deadline extension, Alex!",2024-09-03 21:46:43
14543,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_2,"I thought you already knew, Sarah. The professor mentioned it in class last week.",2024-09-03 21:49:43
14544,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_1,I wasn't in class last week! You could've at least texted me.,2024-09-03 21:53:43
14545,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have. I'm sorry, I didn't think about it at the time.",2024-09-03 22:00:43
14546,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_1,It's frustrating because now I'm behind. What am I supposed to do?,2024-09-03 22:08:43
14547,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_2,How about we work on it together? We can catch up over the weekend.,2024-09-03 22:11:43
14548,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_1,"That sounds good, but I still feel like I missed out on important information.",2024-09-03 22:17:43
14549,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_2,"Let's go over what the professor said last week, then. We can make sure you have all the details.",2024-09-03 22:20:43
14550,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_1,"Thank you, Alex. I appreciate it. I just felt really overwhelmed when I found out.",2024-09-03 22:30:43
14551,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_2,"I understand, Sarah. Next time, I'll make sure to keep you looped in on any updates.",2024-09-03 22:38:43
14552,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_1,That would mean a lot. Let's make a plan for this weekend so we can get back on track.,2024-09-03 22:48:43
14553,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_2,Deal. How about we meet at the library on Saturday morning?,2024-09-03 22:50:43
14554,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_1,Perfect. Thanks for working with me on this.,2024-09-03 22:58:43
14555,deescalatory_conversation_456,speaker_2,No problem. We got this!,2024-09-03 23:02:43
14556,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,"We need to talk about the group project, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:41:47
14557,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_2,"What about it, Jake?",2024-09-03 21:43:47
14558,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,"You missed the last two meetings, and we’re falling behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:48:47
14559,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_2,"I had other commitments, okay? You can't expect me to drop everything.",2024-09-03 21:56:47
14560,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,"I understand you’re busy, but we agreed to prioritize this project.",2024-09-03 22:01:47
14561,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_3,Maybe we can figure out a way to redistribute the workload so it’s more manageable for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:05:47
14562,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_2,I’m willing to help out more if you can give me tasks I can do on my own time.,2024-09-03 22:11:47
14563,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,That sounds fair. How about you handle the research part? It can be done remotely.,2024-09-03 22:15:47
14564,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_3,"Yeah, and I can take over the presentation slides. That way, we’re all still contributing equally.",2024-09-03 22:24:47
14565,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_2,"Alright, that works for me. I’ll start on the research tonight.",2024-09-03 22:30:47
14566,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,Great. Let’s set up another meeting for next week to check in on our progress. Does that work for everyone?,2024-09-03 22:36:47
14567,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_3,"Yes, that works.",2024-09-03 22:39:47
14568,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_2,Agreed. I'm sorry again for not being able to make the meetings.,2024-09-03 22:44:47
14569,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_1,"It’s okay, just keep us posted if anything comes up. Communication is key.",2024-09-03 22:50:47
14570,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_3,"Absolutely. Let’s nail this project together, team.",2024-09-03 23:00:47
14571,deescalatory_conversation_457,speaker_2,Sounds good. Let’s do it.,2024-09-03 23:04:47
14572,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the project deadline being moved up?,2024-09-03 21:38:51
14573,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_2,I only found out about it this morning. I was going to tell you at lunch.,2024-09-03 21:45:51
14574,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_1,But now we have less than two days to finish everything! We could have started reorganizing our tasks immediately.,2024-09-03 21:55:51
14575,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm really sorry. I thought we had more time.",2024-09-03 22:02:51
14576,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_1,"Sorry doesn't change the fact that we're in a tight spot now. We've got a lot to do, and we can't afford any more slip-ups.",2024-09-03 22:04:51
14577,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I get it. How about we split the tasks evenly and start working right now? I'll handle the research part if you can tackle the presentation slides.",2024-09-03 22:06:51
14578,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Let's also plan to check in every few hours to stay on track and make sure we haven't missed anything.,2024-09-03 22:12:51
14579,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_2,Good idea. I'll also draft an email to the professor just to confirm the new deadline and clarify any last-minute requirements.,2024-09-03 22:21:51
14580,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_1,Perfect. And let's keep each other updated on our progress. We can pull this off if we stay focused.,2024-09-03 22:25:51
14581,deescalatory_conversation_458,speaker_2,Agreed. Thanks for understanding. Let's get to work!,2024-09-03 22:28:51
14582,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_1,"Hey, I saw you messing with my design files again. What's up with that?",2024-09-03 21:42:55
14583,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_2,"I wasn't trying to mess with them, I was making some improvements.",2024-09-03 21:51:55
14584,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_1,Improvements? Without even asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:58:55
14585,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_2,"Sorry, I just thought it would save us some time if I made a few tweaks.",2024-09-03 21:59:55
14586,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_1,"I get that, but I need to be in the loop. This is my project, too.",2024-09-03 22:02:55
14587,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_2,"Yeah, I understand. I’ll make sure to talk it over with you next time.",2024-09-03 22:03:55
14588,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_1,Thanks. It's just that we've both worked hard on this and I don't want miscommunication to mess it up.,2024-09-03 22:08:55
14589,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_2,You're right. Maybe we can set up a system to review changes together?,2024-09-03 22:18:55
14590,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. How about we schedule a quick check-in each morning?,2024-09-03 22:24:55
14591,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_2,"Perfect, I think that will help us stay on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:32:55
14592,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_1,"Great, let's give it a shot starting tomorrow.",2024-09-03 22:41:55
14593,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_2,"Alright, looking forward to it. Thanks for bringing it up.",2024-09-03 22:50:55
14594,deescalatory_conversation_459,speaker_1,No problem. Let’s make this project awesome.,2024-09-03 22:53:55
14595,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were struggling with the project, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:37:59
14596,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,"I didn't think I needed to. I thought I could handle it on my own, Claire.",2024-09-03 21:41:59
14597,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,"But you should've let me know. That's why we're partners, to help each other.",2024-09-03 21:48:59
14598,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,"I know, but I felt like I'd be letting you down if I admitted I was having trouble.",2024-09-03 21:51:59
14599,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,Admitting you need help isn't letting me down. It's worse when I find out last minute.,2024-09-03 21:54:59
14600,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,"You're right, I should've communicated better. I'm sorry.",2024-09-03 21:56:59
14601,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,It's okay. Let's just figure out a plan to finish this together.,2024-09-03 22:01:59
14602,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,Agreed. What part do you think we should tackle first?,2024-09-03 22:08:59
14603,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,"Maybe we can start with the data analysis section. I'm pretty comfortable with it, and I can guide you through.",2024-09-03 22:18:59
14604,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,That sounds good. I could really use your help understanding the statistical methods.,2024-09-03 22:21:59
14605,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,"Perfect. We'll work on it together. If you get stuck again, just let me know.",2024-09-03 22:31:59
14606,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,"I will. Thanks for being understanding, Claire.",2024-09-03 22:41:59
14607,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,"No problem, Sam. We're a team after all. Let's make sure we get this done right.",2024-09-03 22:47:59
14608,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_2,Definitely. I appreciate you being there for me.,2024-09-03 22:48:59
14609,deescalatory_conversation_460,speaker_1,"Anytime. Now, let's get to work. We've got this.",2024-09-03 22:58:59
14610,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't consult me before submitting the project proposal.,2024-09-03 21:42:02
14611,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_2,I did what I thought was best given the deadline pressure. You were busy with another task.,2024-09-03 21:52:02
14612,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_1,"Sure, I was busy, but you could have at least sent me a message or called me for a quick discussion.",2024-09-03 22:00:02
14613,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_2,"I understand you feel left out. It was a rushed decision, and I see now that I should have included you.",2024-09-03 22:10:02
14614,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_1,Exactly. This project is too important for unilateral decisions.,2024-09-03 22:15:02
14615,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_2,You're right. How do you think we can avoid this happening in the future?,2024-09-03 22:23:02
14616,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_1,Maybe we can set up a quick daily check-in to ensure we're always on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:32:02
14617,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. We can keep it brief but cover important updates and decisions.,2024-09-03 22:35:02
14618,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_1,"Agreed. And if something urgent comes up and one of us can't be reached, we delay the decision until we can discuss it together.",2024-09-03 22:41:02
14619,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_2,I think that's fair. I'm sorry for rushing ahead without you.,2024-09-03 22:43:02
14620,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate it. Let's make sure we collaborate more closely moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:50:02
14621,deescalatory_conversation_461,speaker_2,Definitely. Working together will make our project stronger.,2024-09-03 22:52:02
14622,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball during the game today?,2024-09-03 21:40:06
14623,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_2,I didn't see you in a good position to score.,2024-09-03 21:45:06
14624,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_1,But I yelled that I was open! You ignored me!,2024-09-03 21:51:06
14625,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_2,I was trying to make the best play for the team. It wasn't personal.,2024-09-03 21:55:06
14626,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_1,It felt personal. You've done this before.,2024-09-03 22:00:06
14627,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_2,I really didn’t mean it that way. Maybe I should have been more aware of your position.,2024-09-03 22:01:06
14628,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_1,And maybe I should work on letting you know I'm open more effectively. What can we do about this?,2024-09-03 22:07:06
14629,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_2,We could spend some extra time practicing our signals and positioning.,2024-09-03 22:11:06
14630,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_1,"That sounds like a good idea. Also, maybe we should talk more during the game to avoid misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 22:16:06
14631,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_2,Agreed. Communication is key. Let's make sure to keep each other informed.,2024-09-03 22:23:06
14632,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. I want us to succeed as a team.,2024-09-03 22:27:06
14633,deescalatory_conversation_462,speaker_2,Same here. Let's focus on improving together.,2024-09-03 22:35:06
14634,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball during the game, Jake?",2024-09-03 21:47:09
14635,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_2,"I didn't think you were open, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:51:09
14636,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_1,I was wide open multiple times! You need to look around more.,2024-09-03 22:00:09
14637,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_2,"Maybe, but I thought Jason had a better shot.",2024-09-03 22:02:09
14638,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_1,This isn't just about today. You've been ignoring my position for a while now.,2024-09-03 22:10:09
14639,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_2,I didn't realize you felt that way. Can you tell me more about when this started?,2024-09-03 22:19:09
14640,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_1,"It feels like it started a few games ago. It's frustrating when I know I can contribute, but I'm not getting the chance.",2024-09-03 22:23:09
14641,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_2,I get that. I guess I was just focused on other things. What would help you feel more included?,2024-09-03 22:24:09
14642,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_1,Just keep an eye out for me more and trust that I can make the shot too.,2024-09-03 22:34:09
14643,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_2,"Okay, I can do that. I'll try to be more aware on the court.",2024-09-03 22:42:09
14644,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jake. I appreciate it.",2024-09-03 22:51:09
14645,deescalatory_conversation_463,speaker_2,"No problem, Sarah. We're a team, after all. Let's work on better communication during our plays.",2024-09-03 22:55:09
14646,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and changed the project proposal without telling me!,2024-09-03 21:38:13
14647,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_2,I understand you're upset. I felt like we were running out of time and needed to streamline the process.,2024-09-03 21:47:13
14648,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_1,But we agreed we would make decisions together. Now the whole plan looks different.,2024-09-03 21:50:13
14649,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_2,"You're right, we did. I'm sorry for not consulting you first. Can we review the changes together now?",2024-09-03 21:51:13
14650,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_1,It's just frustrating because I had some important points I wanted to include.,2024-09-03 21:56:13
14651,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_2,I get that. Let's take your points into consideration and see how we can integrate them into the revised proposal.,2024-09-03 21:59:13
14652,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_1,"Alright, that sounds fair. Can we start with the section on market analysis?",2024-09-03 22:09:13
14653,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_2,"Sure, let's go through it. What specifically did you want to add?",2024-09-03 22:11:13
14654,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_1,I think we need more data on emerging markets; it gives us a stronger case.,2024-09-03 22:15:13
14655,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_2,That's a great idea. I'll pull up the data we have and we can figure out where it fits best.,2024-09-03 22:21:13
14656,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_1,Thanks for being understanding. I just want us to present the best work possible.,2024-09-03 22:31:13
14657,deescalatory_conversation_464,speaker_2,"Me too. We're a team, and our combined input will definitely make this proposal better.",2024-09-03 22:39:13
14658,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,"I saw your notes, Sarah. They were suspiciously similar to mine.",2024-09-03 21:46:15
14659,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,"What are you talking about, Emily? I didn't copy anything.",2024-09-03 21:49:15
14660,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,"Look, I'm not accusing you. I'm just saying the answers look identical.",2024-09-03 21:52:15
14661,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,Maybe because we studied together and came to the same conclusions?,2024-09-03 21:59:15
14662,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,"Sure, but on specific questions? Word for word?",2024-09-03 22:08:15
14663,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,"Okay, I understand why you're worried. What do you suggest we do?",2024-09-03 22:11:15
14664,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,"Maybe we should both talk to Mr. Johnson about it, just to clear things up.",2024-09-03 22:16:15
14665,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,"Yeah, that sounds like a reasonable idea. I don't want any misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 22:22:15
14666,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,Neither do I. I'll set up a meeting with him after class.,2024-09-03 22:30:15
14667,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,"Thanks, Emily. I appreciate you coming to me first instead of going straight to him.",2024-09-03 22:38:15
14668,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,No problem. I just want to make sure everything's fair and clear between us.,2024-09-03 22:42:15
14669,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_2,Me too. Let's go talk to him together and get this resolved.,2024-09-03 22:49:15
14670,deescalatory_conversation_465,speaker_1,Agreed.,2024-09-03 22:51:15
14671,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"Hey, I noticed you haven't been pulling your weight on the group project lately. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:43:19
14672,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,"I get that it looks like I'm slacking, but I've had a lot on my plate with work and other classes. I've been trying to keep up.",2024-09-03 21:48:19
14673,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"I understand that you're busy, but we all are. We need to figure out a way for everyone to contribute equally.",2024-09-03 21:56:19
14674,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,"Yeah, I agree. Maybe we can divide the tasks differently. I'm pretty good at research, so I can handle that part more if someone else can take on some of the writing.",2024-09-03 22:04:19
14675,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"That sounds fair. Do you think you can have the research done by the end of the week, though? We’re really tight on time.",2024-09-03 22:13:19
14676,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,I can definitely manage that. How about we meet up on Thursday to review the research together and integrate it into the draft?,2024-09-03 22:22:19
14677,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,Thursday works for me. I’ll let the others know about the change in our task division. Thanks for being flexible.,2024-09-03 22:26:19
14678,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,No problem. I appreciate you bringing this up. I don’t want to let the group down.,2024-09-03 22:35:19
14679,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_1,"Great, let’s get this done and make our project the best it can be.",2024-09-03 22:43:19
14680,deescalatory_conversation_466,speaker_2,"Absolutely, let's do it.",2024-09-03 22:45:19
14681,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,Why did you delete my code from the project without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:40:22
14682,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,I didn't think it was functioning correctly and was causing the app to crash.,2024-09-03 21:48:22
14683,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,But you should have at least talked to me before making that decision.,2024-09-03 21:57:22
14684,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,"I see your point. Next time, I'll definitely discuss it with you first.",2024-09-03 22:04:22
14685,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,"Thanks. I put a lot of effort into that part, and it feels dismissive when changes are made without consultation.",2024-09-03 22:08:22
14686,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,Understood. Can you show me how your code is supposed to work? Maybe we can fix it together.,2024-09-03 22:10:22
14687,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,"Sure, I'd appreciate that. There were a few dependencies that might not have been clear.",2024-09-03 22:11:22
14688,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,"Okay, let's go through those dependencies and see if we can integrate your code smoothly.",2024-09-03 22:19:22
14689,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_1,Sounds good. Thanks for being open to this. It means a lot to work collaboratively.,2024-09-03 22:20:22
14690,deescalatory_conversation_467,speaker_2,"No problem. We're a team, and we need to support each other to make the project the best it can be.",2024-09-03 22:29:22
14691,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't tell me about the project deadline change, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:41:25
14692,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,"Emma, I'm sorry. I thought you knew. It was posted on the class board last week.",2024-09-03 21:47:25
14693,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,I didn't see that. You know I rely on you for updates.,2024-09-03 21:52:25
14694,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,"Maybe I should have checked in with you, but it would help if you also kept an eye on the board.",2024-09-03 21:59:25
14695,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,"I suppose I could do that more often, but still, you could have mentioned it.",2024-09-03 22:06:25
14696,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,"You're right, Emma. I'll make more of an effort to inform you next time.",2024-09-03 22:09:25
14697,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. I guess I should be more proactive, too.",2024-09-03 22:17:25
14698,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,Agreed. We both have room to improve. Let's work together better on this.,2024-09-03 22:27:25
14699,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,"Deal. So, can we divide the tasks for the project due tomorrow?",2024-09-03 22:32:25
14700,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_2,"Sure thing. How about I handle the research, and you can put together the presentation?",2024-09-03 22:41:25
14701,deescalatory_conversation_468,speaker_1,Sounds good. Let's get it done.,2024-09-03 22:45:25
14702,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for band practice yesterday? We needed everyone there to prepare for our performance.,2024-09-03 21:38:28
14703,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,I had a lot of homework to catch up on. I thought missing one practice wouldn't be a big deal.,2024-09-03 21:48:28
14704,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,"But it was a big deal. We're performing next week, and we need to be in sync.",2024-09-03 21:50:28
14705,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,I get that. I just didn’t think it would make such a difference.,2024-09-03 21:51:28
14706,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,Can we agree that everyone's attendance is crucial at this point?,2024-09-03 21:56:28
14707,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,"Yes, I understand now. I'll make sure to be there for all the remaining practices.",2024-09-03 22:05:28
14708,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,Great. Can you also catch up with what we practiced yesterday? We tried some new transitions.,2024-09-03 22:09:28
14709,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,"Sure, I'll ask someone to run through it with me before the next practice.",2024-09-03 22:10:28
14710,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_1,"Thanks. We all want to do our best, and it's easier when everyone is committed.",2024-09-03 22:12:28
14711,deescalatory_conversation_469,speaker_2,I appreciate you pointing that out. I'll definitely prioritize band practice from now on.,2024-09-03 22:14:28
14712,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,Why did you use my laptop without asking?,2024-09-03 21:42:30
14713,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"I needed to finish my report, and my laptop wasn't working. Yours was the only one available.",2024-09-03 21:47:30
14714,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,"But you could have messaged me or something. It's about respect, you know?",2024-09-03 21:56:30
14715,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"I understand, I should've asked first. I was just stressed and in a hurry. Sorry about that.",2024-09-03 21:57:30
14716,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,"Alright, but make sure it doesn't happen again. Did you find everything you needed?",2024-09-03 22:02:30
14717,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"Yeah, your laptop helped a lot. I really appreciate it.",2024-09-03 22:05:30
14718,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,"Good, but please try to remember to ask next time. We cool?",2024-09-03 22:13:30
14719,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_2,"Yeah, we're cool. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:17:30
14720,deescalatory_conversation_470,speaker_1,"No problem. Just make sure to save your report on your own device too, in case you need it again.",2024-09-03 22:18:30
14721,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,"What were you thinking, Alice? You completely missed the deadline for our project submission.",2024-09-03 21:40:34
14722,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"I know, I messed up. It’s just that I had so much going on that I lost track of time.",2024-09-03 21:43:34
14723,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,"But when we agreed to split the work, we trusted each other to get things done on time. Now the whole team is in trouble.",2024-09-03 21:48:34
14724,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,I understand. I'm really sorry. How can we fix this?,2024-09-03 21:49:34
14725,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,"We need to explain the situation to our professor and ask for an extension. Maybe if we all own up to it, we'll get another chance.",2024-09-03 21:58:34
14726,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I'll arrange a meeting with the professor today.,2024-09-03 22:03:34
14727,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_3,"I've been listening, and I think we should all attend the meeting to show that we're serious about making this right.",2024-09-03 22:10:34
14728,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,"Agreed. Alice, if you take the lead on this, we'll support you.",2024-09-03 22:11:34
14729,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"Thank you for understanding. I'll draft an email to the professor now, and we can review it together before I send it.",2024-09-03 22:13:34
14730,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_3,Sounds like a plan. Let’s look at the rest of the project and see what else needs immediate attention.,2024-09-03 22:20:34
14731,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_1,"Let's aim to complete everything before the new proposed deadline, assuming we get it. We can’t afford any more delays.",2024-09-03 22:30:34
14732,deescalatory_conversation_471,speaker_2,"I appreciate you guys sticking together through this. This won’t happen again,",2024-09-03 22:38:34
14733,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't tell me about the project deadline being moved up!,2024-09-03 21:39:37
14734,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but I only found out myself yesterday.",2024-09-03 21:41:37
14735,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,"Well, now we're both scrambling to finish everything on time.",2024-09-03 21:49:37
14736,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,"I know, it's frustrating. Can we brainstorm how to divide the work so it gets done?",2024-09-03 21:54:37
14737,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,"Yeah, sure. What parts do you think you can handle?",2024-09-03 22:03:37
14738,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,I can finish the research portion if you can focus on compiling and editing the report.,2024-09-03 22:04:37
14739,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I'll start working on the introduction and conclusion.,2024-09-03 22:07:37
14740,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,"Great, and I'll make sure all the data is organized and referenced correctly.",2024-09-03 22:16:37
14741,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,We should probably check in with each other tomorrow to see our progress.,2024-09-03 22:24:37
14742,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,Agreed. How about we meet up at lunch to review what we've done so far?,2024-09-03 22:27:37
14743,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,Perfect. Let's aim to get most of it done by then so we can finalize it together.,2024-09-03 22:33:37
14744,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,Absolutely. We'll get this done on time if we stay focused.,2024-09-03 22:43:37
14745,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. We'll make it work.,2024-09-03 22:45:37
14746,deescalatory_conversation_472,speaker_2,"No problem. We're a team, and we'll handle this together.",2024-09-03 22:55:37
14747,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,Why did you ignore the deadline for the group project? We needed everyone's input.,2024-09-03 21:42:42
14748,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,I didn't ignore it. I just had too much on my plate with other coursework.,2024-09-03 21:51:42
14749,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,We all have busy schedules. You could have at least communicated that.,2024-09-03 21:52:42
14750,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,I get it. I should've said something. What can we do now to fix it?,2024-09-03 21:54:42
14751,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,We’re behind. Let's divide the remaining tasks and push the deadline with the professor's approval.,2024-09-03 22:00:42
14752,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,That sounds like a plan. I can handle the research part.,2024-09-03 22:10:42
14753,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,"Great, I’ll work on the presentation. How about we meet tomorrow to discuss our progress?",2024-09-03 22:13:42
14754,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,Works for me. Let's set a time right away.,2024-09-03 22:16:42
14755,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,How about 3 PM in the library?,2024-09-03 22:22:42
14756,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,"Perfect, I'll be there. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:26:42
14757,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_1,No problem. Let’s make sure we see this through together.,2024-09-03 22:28:42
14758,deescalatory_conversation_473,speaker_2,Agreed. We’ve got this.,2024-09-03 22:32:42
14759,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball when I was wide open?,2024-09-03 21:42:46
14760,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, I was surrounded by defenders.",2024-09-03 21:50:46
14761,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,"You always say that, but it's like you don't even look for your teammates.",2024-09-03 21:54:46
14762,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,"That's not true. I try my best to look for everyone, but sometimes it's hard in the moment.",2024-09-03 21:55:46
14763,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_3,"Hold on, guys. Maybe we can learn from this. Can we figure out how to communicate better on the field?",2024-09-03 22:04:46
14764,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,"Sure, but it feels like some of us aren't even trying to pass.",2024-09-03 22:14:46
14765,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,"I get that you're frustrated, but it's not like that. Maybe we need a better system to signal when we're open.",2024-09-03 22:19:46
14766,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,Maybe we do. What if we used more hand signals?,2024-09-03 22:25:46
14767,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,Hand signals could work. And maybe we can practice it more during training.,2024-09-03 22:27:46
14768,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's bring it up with coach and see if we can incorporate it into our practices.,2024-09-03 22:29:46
14769,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_1,"Yeah, I think that would help. I don't want to be frustrated with you guys; I just want us to win.",2024-09-03 22:31:46
14770,deescalatory_conversation_474,speaker_2,I want that too. Let's work on this together and improve our game.,2024-09-03 22:32:46
14771,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,"Dylan, I really need to talk to you about the group project.",2024-09-03 21:42:49
14772,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,"Sure, what's up, Mia?",2024-09-03 21:45:49
14773,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,"I noticed that you haven't been attending our meetings, and we're falling behind.",2024-09-03 21:47:49
14774,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,I've been really busy with work. I’m trying my best to contribute.,2024-09-03 21:53:49
14775,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,"I understand, but it's affecting the whole group. Can you make a plan to join the next meetings?",2024-09-03 21:59:49
14776,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,I'll rearrange my schedule. I didn't realize it was causing such an issue.,2024-09-03 22:09:49
14777,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,"Thanks, Dylan. We also need your part of the research by Friday. Do you think you can manage that?",2024-09-03 22:10:49
14778,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,I think that's doable. I’ll stay up late if I have to.,2024-09-03 22:11:49
14779,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,I appreciate your effort. We'll review everything together after you send it.,2024-09-03 22:19:49
14780,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,Sounds good. Let’s push through and finish this strong.,2024-09-03 22:24:49
14781,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_1,"Agreed. Thanks for understanding, Dylan.",2024-09-03 22:28:49
14782,deescalatory_conversation_475,speaker_2,"No problem, Mia. Let’s keep the communication open.",2024-09-03 22:37:49
14783,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you erase my part of the code on this project?",2024-09-03 21:46:52
14784,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,"I didn't erase it, I just made some edits. Your code had some bugs.",2024-09-03 21:51:52
14785,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,But you didn't even ask me first! I could have fixed it myself.,2024-09-03 22:01:52
14786,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,"I know, but we were running out of time. I thought it was urgent.",2024-09-03 22:09:52
14787,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,"Still, you should have told me. It feels like you don't trust my skills.",2024-09-03 22:12:52
14788,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,That's not true. I do trust your skills. I just panicked under the deadline pressure.,2024-09-03 22:15:52
14789,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,We need to communicate better. This project is a team effort.,2024-09-03 22:16:52
14790,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,You're right. I should have informed you before changing anything.,2024-09-03 22:25:52
14791,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,Let's set some clear guidelines about how we handle changes next time.,2024-09-03 22:35:52
14792,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,Agreed. And I'll make sure to consult with you before making any major changes.,2024-09-03 22:44:52
14793,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate it. Let's try to finish this project strong together.,2024-09-03 22:50:52
14794,deescalatory_conversation_476,speaker_2,Absolutely. We can still make this work if we collaborate better.,2024-09-03 22:59:52
14795,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,I can't believe you changed the presentation without telling me!,2024-09-03 21:43:55
14796,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,"I had to fix some mistakes, and I didn't think it would be a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:51:55
14797,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,It is a big deal! We agreed on the content together.,2024-09-03 21:56:55
14798,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,"Look, I was just trying to make it better. Can we go over the changes now?",2024-09-03 21:58:55
14799,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,"Fine, but why didn't you at least call or send a message?",2024-09-03 22:02:55
14800,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have. I'm sorry about that.",2024-09-03 22:04:55
14801,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,Okay. Let's just go through the changes so we're on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:13:55
14802,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,Absolutely. The main edit was in the third slide—it needed more data to support our point.,2024-09-03 22:17:55
14803,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,"I see that now. The data does make it stronger. But next time, can you involve me in the revision process?",2024-09-03 22:18:55
14804,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,Definitely. We should be collaborating more closely on this.,2024-09-03 22:25:55
14805,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,"Agreed. By working together, we can make sure the presentation is consistent.",2024-09-03 22:31:55
14806,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. Let's finish this up and make it the best we can.,2024-09-03 22:37:55
14807,deescalatory_conversation_477,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. Let's start with slide one and work our way through.,2024-09-03 22:40:55
14808,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you didn't pass the ball to me, Jenny. I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:38:59
14809,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,"Tom, I get that, but you were covered too much from my angle. I thought passing to Emily was the better choice.",2024-09-03 21:47:59
14810,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,But Emily was surrounded by defenders! It doesn't make sense.,2024-09-03 21:52:59
14811,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_3,"Look, can we all just calm down and figure out what happened? This isn't helping.",2024-09-03 22:01:59
14812,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,"Fine. Tom, from where I was standing, you had two players on you. Emily had a better chance to shoot despite the defenders.",2024-09-03 22:11:59
14813,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,"But every time, Jenny. You always overlook me. It feels personal.",2024-09-03 22:21:59
14814,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_3,"Tom, Jenny's explaining her perspective. Maybe it wasn't as clear-cut on the field as you thought.",2024-09-03 22:27:59
14815,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,"I hear that, but maybe we need to communicate better next time, Jenny.",2024-09-03 22:28:59
14816,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,"I agree on that, Tom. Maybe we should come up with some kind of signal for open players.",2024-09-03 22:33:59
14817,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_3,That sounds constructive. Let's practice that during our next training session.,2024-09-03 22:38:59
14818,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_1,"Alright, I'm on board with that plan.",2024-09-03 22:44:59
14819,deescalatory_conversation_478,speaker_2,Me too. Let's focus on improving as a team.,2024-09-03 22:47:59
14820,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for our project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:40:02
14821,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, and I couldn't get away. I tried to text you.",2024-09-03 21:44:02
14822,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,"I understand, but you could have at least sent a brief message. We were counting on you.",2024-09-03 21:48:02
14823,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry about that. It all happened so fast, and I was overwhelmed.",2024-09-03 21:56:02
14824,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,"I get it, emergencies happen. But we're already behind schedule. How can we catch up?",2024-09-03 21:57:02
14825,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,Maybe we can set up an extra meeting this weekend? I'll make sure to prepare everything in advance.,2024-09-03 22:06:02
14826,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,That could work. I'll check my schedule and see if I can free up some time.,2024-09-03 22:08:02
14827,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,"Great, and to make up for my absence, I'll take on an extra part of the project.",2024-09-03 22:09:02
14828,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,"That sounds fair. Let's try to keep better communication from now on, okay?",2024-09-03 22:11:02
14829,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll do better about letting you know what's going on.,2024-09-03 22:14:02
14830,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's focus on getting this project back on track.,2024-09-03 22:22:02
14831,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll send out an agenda for our weekend meeting later today.,2024-09-03 22:27:02
14832,deescalatory_conversation_479,speaker_1,Perfect. Looking forward to getting this done together.,2024-09-03 22:34:02
14833,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,"Hey, why did you delete my code from the project without asking?",2024-09-03 21:42:05
14834,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,I didn’t think it was working with the new updates we were implementing.,2024-09-03 21:52:05
14835,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,But you could have talked to me first. I spent hours on that.,2024-09-03 21:56:05
14836,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,"Look, I didn't mean to undermine you. I just thought we needed to move quickly.",2024-09-03 21:59:05
14837,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,We can't move quickly if we're not communicating. This isn't just your project.,2024-09-03 22:07:05
14838,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,You're right. I should have consulted you. How about we review your code together to see how it fits with the new updates?,2024-09-03 22:08:05
14839,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I just want to make sure we're on the same page next time.,2024-09-03 22:11:05
14840,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's set up a quick meeting to go over any major changes before implementing them in the future.,2024-09-03 22:21:05
14841,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_1,Perfect. And thanks for being open to discussing this.,2024-09-03 22:22:05
14842,deescalatory_conversation_480,speaker_2,No problem. I appreciate you bringing it up. Let's make the project even better together.,2024-09-03 22:27:05
14843,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,"Hey, I saw you submitted the group project without checking with us. What's up with that?",2024-09-03 21:48:08
14844,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,"I had to, the deadline was tight and nobody was responding.",2024-09-03 21:57:08
14845,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_3,"Yeah, but you could've waited a bit longer or at least sent another reminder.",2024-09-03 22:07:08
14846,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,"I get that, but I felt like no one was taking it seriously, and I didn't want us to fail.",2024-09-03 22:16:08
14847,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,"We are taking it seriously. We've just been juggling other assignments, you know? Communication is key.",2024-09-03 22:26:08
14848,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,I agree. Maybe I jumped the gun. Can we review it together now and see if there are any last-minute changes we can still make?,2024-09-03 22:33:08
14849,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_3,That sounds fair. Let's go through it section by section.,2024-09-03 22:43:08
14850,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_1,"Alright. If we can find any improvements, at least it'll show that we still collaborated.",2024-09-03 22:45:08
14851,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_2,"Thanks, guys. I'll pull up the document now.",2024-09-03 22:50:08
14852,deescalatory_conversation_481,speaker_3,"Cool. Let's make this the best we can, considering the circumstances.",2024-09-03 22:56:08
14853,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"You know you missed the team practice again, right? This is the third time, Josh.",2024-09-03 21:42:12
14854,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Coach, but I've had a lot going on with schoolwork and family stuff.",2024-09-03 21:52:12
14855,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"I understand life can be hectic, but we need everyone committed if we're going to compete in the finals.",2024-09-03 22:01:12
14856,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"I get that, but balancing everything has been really tough. I'm not trying to let the team down.",2024-09-03 22:07:12
14857,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,Maybe we can figure out a way to adjust your schedule. What exactly are you struggling with?,2024-09-03 22:15:12
14858,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,It’s mainly all the assignments and projects. They keep piling up.,2024-09-03 22:23:12
14859,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,Could you try talking to your teachers? Sometimes they can give extensions if you explain your situation.,2024-09-03 22:32:12
14860,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,I haven’t tried that yet. I guess I could see what they say.,2024-09-03 22:36:12
14861,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"And if you need help with any of the subjects, maybe some of the teammates can help out. We’ve got a great group of people.",2024-09-03 22:43:12
14862,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,That’s a good idea. I hadn’t thought about asking them for help with schoolwork.,2024-09-03 22:53:12
14863,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_1,"Remember, we’re a team on and off the field. We can get through this together. Practicing regularly is important, but we also need you to be at your best mentally and academically.",2024-09-03 22:56:12
14864,deescalatory_conversation_482,speaker_2,"Thanks, Coach. I’ll talk to my teachers and see if I can organize my",2024-09-03 23:02:12
14865,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,"Why didn't you finish your part of the group project, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:47:15
14866,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,"I was overwhelmed with other assignments, Mia. It's been tough managing everything.",2024-09-03 21:54:15
14867,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,"I get that, but we agreed on dividing the tasks evenly. Now we're behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:58:15
14868,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm really sorry. Can we figure out how to get back on track?",2024-09-03 22:05:15
14869,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_3,Maybe we can redistribute some of the pending work. What still needs to be done?,2024-09-03 22:06:15
14870,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,We still need to finalize the presentation slides and the report summary.,2024-09-03 22:10:15
14871,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,"I can take care of the presentation slides if you can handle the report summary, Mia. Does that work?",2024-09-03 22:16:15
14872,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Let's set up a time to go over everything together before the deadline.,2024-09-03 22:22:15
14873,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_3,Agreed. How about we meet tomorrow after class to review our progress?,2024-09-03 22:26:15
14874,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_2,"That works for me. Thanks, everyone, for being understanding.",2024-09-03 22:27:15
14875,deescalatory_conversation_483,speaker_1,"No problem, Alex. Let's make sure we communicate better from now on.",2024-09-03 22:35:15
14876,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,"I can't believe you actually submitted the report without consulting me, John.",2024-09-03 21:48:19
14877,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"Emily, I thought we agreed on the key points last week. I didn't see the need to go over it again.",2024-09-03 21:53:19
14878,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,"Well, you completely ignored my section on market analysis. That was crucial!",2024-09-03 22:03:19
14879,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"I see your point, but I felt it didn't fit the overall direction of the report. Maybe we can discuss how to include it constructively next time?",2024-09-03 22:06:19
14880,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,"It's not just about inclusion. It's about collaboration. We need to agree on these things, not just decide unilaterally.",2024-09-03 22:09:19
14881,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. How about we go through the report together again and see where we can make adjustments?,2024-09-03 22:11:19
14882,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I appreciate your willingness to revisit this.,2024-09-03 22:20:19
14883,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,Great. Let's set up a time tomorrow to go through it. I'll make sure your points on market analysis are properly integrated.,2024-09-03 22:30:19
14884,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_1,"Thanks, John. I think we can make this a really strong report with both our inputs.",2024-09-03 22:34:19
14885,deescalatory_conversation_484,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Emily. Looking forward to our collaboration.",2024-09-03 22:36:19
14886,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,Why did you change the project presentation without consulting us first?,2024-09-03 21:47:22
14887,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,I thought the new format would work better and save us time.,2024-09-03 21:49:22
14888,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,But we're a team. We need to make these decisions together.,2024-09-03 21:55:22
14889,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_3,"Yeah, it feels like you don't trust our input.",2024-09-03 22:00:22
14890,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,I do trust you guys; I just didn't want to waste time on an idea that might not work.,2024-09-03 22:05:22
14891,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,"We understand that, but part of working together is discussing these decisions.",2024-09-03 22:06:22
14892,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_3,Exactly. We could have combined ideas and maybe come up with something even better.,2024-09-03 22:09:22
14893,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,You're right. I should have brought it up with you first. Can we talk about it now and find a solution together?,2024-09-03 22:17:22
14894,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,I think that's a good idea. Let's go through it and see if we can merge our ideas.,2024-09-03 22:24:22
14895,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's review both versions and pick the best parts of each.,2024-09-03 22:32:22
14896,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_2,Thanks for being open to this. I really want us to succeed as a team.,2024-09-03 22:34:22
14897,deescalatory_conversation_485,speaker_1,We all do. Let's move forward together.,2024-09-03 22:42:22
14898,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted the project without telling me, Mike.",2024-09-03 21:45:26
14899,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"I just wanted to make sure it was turned in on time, Sarah. You were taking too long to review the final draft.",2024-09-03 21:55:26
14900,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,I was taking my time to make sure it was perfect. We agreed to review it together one last time.,2024-09-03 22:01:26
14901,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"I know, but the deadline was really close. I didn't want us to miss it and get a bad grade.",2024-09-03 22:11:26
14902,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"But that’s not the point. We’re supposed to work as a team, and you didn’t consult me.",2024-09-03 22:15:26
14903,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"You’re right, I should have. I just panicked.",2024-09-03 22:25:26
14904,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"Okay. I appreciate that you wanted to get it done on time, but we need to communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:34:26
14905,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"Agreed. Next time, I’ll make sure to talk to you first, no matter what.",2024-09-03 22:39:26
14906,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,Deal. Let’s also figure out a way to split the review work so we’re both satisfied with the final product.,2024-09-03 22:44:26
14907,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,That sounds fair. How about we designate specific sections to each of us for the final review?,2024-09-03 22:51:26
14908,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,I think that could work. And let’s set earlier internal deadlines to avoid last-minute panic.,2024-09-03 22:53:26
14909,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_2,"Good idea. I’m sorry about how things went this time, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:59:26
14910,deescalatory_conversation_486,speaker_1,"Thanks, Mike.",2024-09-03 23:03:26
14911,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,"Why did you send that email to the client without consulting us, James?",2024-09-03 21:39:29
14912,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,I thought it was urgent and needed to be addressed immediately.,2024-09-03 21:45:29
14913,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,But you know we always discuss client communications as a team first.,2024-09-03 21:52:29
14914,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_3,We just want to understand why you felt it was necessary to bypass the usual process.,2024-09-03 21:56:29
14915,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,"I felt the client was getting impatient, and I didn't want to risk losing the account.",2024-09-03 22:01:29
14916,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,"We appreciate your concern about the client, but it's important to maintain our agreed-upon procedures.",2024-09-03 22:07:29
14917,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_3,"Maybe in the future, you can give us a quick heads-up if you're facing a situation like this again.",2024-09-03 22:09:29
14918,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I didn't mean to cause any issues.,2024-09-03 22:14:29
14919,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,"No harm done this time, but let's make sure we communicate better moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:23:29
14920,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll be more mindful. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:25:29
14921,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_3,"Thanks, James. We're all on the same team here.",2024-09-03 22:35:29
14922,deescalatory_conversation_487,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let's just keep the lines of communication open.,2024-09-03 22:39:29
14923,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,Why did you change the layout of the presentation without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:40:32
14924,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,I thought it would make it more engaging for the audience.,2024-09-03 21:47:32
14925,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,But we agreed on the original format. It threw me off during the meeting.,2024-09-03 21:57:32
14926,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,I’m sorry about that. I should have discussed it with you first.,2024-09-03 22:05:32
14927,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,It’s not just that. It feels like you don’t value my input.,2024-09-03 22:07:32
14928,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,"I do value your input, but I felt the change was necessary. How can we find a solution together?",2024-09-03 22:12:32
14929,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,"Maybe we can establish a protocol for making changes. That way, we both stay informed.",2024-09-03 22:14:32
14930,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,That sounds fair. Let’s schedule a brief check-in before finalizing any major updates.,2024-09-03 22:15:32
14931,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_1,Agreed. This will help us avoid miscommunications in the future.,2024-09-03 22:24:32
14932,deescalatory_conversation_488,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for being open to resolving this.,2024-09-03 22:28:32
14933,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't show up for the project meeting, Jess.",2024-09-03 21:48:35
14934,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,"I know, but something came up last minute. I'm really sorry.",2024-09-03 21:56:35
14935,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,It's always something with you. We're all counting on each other to finish this on time.,2024-09-03 22:06:35
14936,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,"I get it, and I should have let you all know earlier. What did I miss? I want to catch up.",2024-09-03 22:11:35
14937,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,We discussed the final presentation format and divided the remaining sections. There's a lot to do.,2024-09-03 22:19:35
14938,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,Can you fill me in on my sections? I'll start working on them right away.,2024-09-03 22:28:35
14939,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"Sure, you're responsible for the financial analysis and the marketing strategy. It's important we get those right.",2024-09-03 22:38:35
14940,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll make sure to focus on those. When's our next meeting?,2024-09-03 22:39:35
14941,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"Tomorrow at 3 PM. Please, make sure to be there this time.",2024-09-03 22:41:35
14942,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,"I promise, I won't miss it. Can I also help with anything else in the meantime?",2024-09-03 22:43:35
14943,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"Actually, if you could review the research data we compiled, it would really help. We need to make sure it's accurate.",2024-09-03 22:52:35
14944,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,Consider it done. I'll go through it tonight and have notes by morning.,2024-09-03 23:01:35
14945,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jess. Let's try to stay on track. We can knock this out together.",2024-09-03 23:06:35
14946,deescalatory_conversation_489,speaker_2,"Agreed. Let's make this project great,",2024-09-03 23:14:35
14947,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,"Why did you leave the project halfway through, Kelly?",2024-09-03 21:42:39
14948,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,"I didn't leave it halfway through, Jake. I was called into another urgent meeting.",2024-09-03 21:47:39
14949,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,"You know how important this deadline is, right? We can't afford to lose more time.",2024-09-03 21:50:39
14950,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,"I understand, and I apologize for not informing you earlier. Could we redistribute the tasks so we can catch up?",2024-09-03 21:59:39
14951,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_3,I agree with Kelly. We've all been juggling multiple responsibilities. Let's find a solution together.,2024-09-03 22:06:39
14952,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,"Okay, fair point. Let's look at what remains to be done. Kelly, can you handle the data analysis if I take over the report writing?",2024-09-03 22:15:39
14953,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,That works for me. I can finish the data analysis by tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:17:39
14954,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_3,And I can manage the presentation slides. Let's set a quick meeting at the end of the day to check progress.,2024-09-03 22:26:39
14955,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,Sounds like a plan. I'll draft a new timeline and share it with both of you shortly.,2024-09-03 22:27:39
14956,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_2,"Thanks, Jake. Let's ensure we communicate better moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:35:39
14957,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_3,Agreed. Clear communication will help us navigate these tight deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:40:39
14958,deescalatory_conversation_490,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let's get back on track and deliver this on time.,2024-09-03 22:45:39
14959,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball during the last play, Jake.",2024-09-03 21:41:42
14960,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Sam, but I didn't think you were in the best position to score.",2024-09-03 21:44:42
14961,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,But I was wide open! We could've tied the game!,2024-09-03 21:53:42
14962,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,"Maybe, but I didn't see you right away, and I panicked.",2024-09-03 21:58:42
14963,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,We just keep losing because of poor decisions like that.,2024-09-03 22:03:42
14964,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_3,"Guys, let's not turn on each other now. We all made mistakes out there.",2024-09-03 22:08:42
14965,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,"It's just frustrating, you know. We practice so hard.",2024-09-03 22:14:42
14966,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,"I get it, Sam. I feel the same way. But blaming each other won't help us improve.",2024-09-03 22:16:42
14967,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_3,Right. We need to think about how we can better communicate on the court.,2024-09-03 22:17:42
14968,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,"So, what do we do next then?",2024-09-03 22:23:42
14969,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,How about we spend extra time working on passing drills?,2024-09-03 22:27:42
14970,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_3,Good idea. And let's also try to call out when we're open—louder and clearer.,2024-09-03 22:36:42
14971,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,Fine. I guess that's a start.,2024-09-03 22:39:42
14972,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,We're a team. We win together and lose together. We'll figure this out.,2024-09-03 22:40:42
14973,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_3,Exactly. Let's focus on supporting each other and learning from our mistakes.,2024-09-03 22:48:42
14974,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_1,Alright. Let's give it another go in practice tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:52:42
14975,deescalatory_conversation_491,speaker_2,Deal. We’ll,2024-09-03 23:02:42
14976,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball in the last quarter?,2024-09-03 21:39:45
14977,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,I thought I had a better shot at scoring.,2024-09-03 21:40:45
14978,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,But you missed and now we're losing!,2024-09-03 21:43:45
14979,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,"I know, but I was open and felt confident.",2024-09-03 21:46:45
14980,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,We're a team. You should have trusted me.,2024-09-03 21:49:45
14981,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,You're right. I should have considered passing.,2024-09-03 21:57:45
14982,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,Let's make sure we communicate better on the court.,2024-09-03 22:04:45
14983,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,Absolutely. We need to work together to turn this around.,2024-09-03 22:06:45
14984,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,"Next time, let's call for plays more clearly.",2024-09-03 22:16:45
14985,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,Agreed. And I'll make sure to listen for your cues.,2024-09-03 22:19:45
14986,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,We still have time to improve before the next game.,2024-09-03 22:28:45
14987,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,Definitely. We'll focus on team coordination in practice.,2024-09-03 22:35:45
14988,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_1,I'm glad we talked this out. Let's keep pushing forward.,2024-09-03 22:39:45
14989,deescalatory_conversation_492,speaker_2,Me too. Let's win the next game together.,2024-09-03 22:41:45
14990,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the group project without consulting any of us first.,2024-09-03 21:45:49
14991,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,"Look, I did what I thought was best. We were running out of time!",2024-09-03 21:52:49
14992,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,"But we agreed on reviewing each section together, didn't we?",2024-09-03 21:53:49
14993,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,"Yes, but time was slipping away. Would you rather have missed the deadline?",2024-09-03 22:02:49
14994,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,It's not about the deadline; it's about making sure everyone is on the same page. We wanted to ensure the quality.,2024-09-03 22:08:49
14995,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,"I understand, but I felt pressured to make a decision. I'm sorry if it upset you both.",2024-09-03 22:17:49
14996,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,"We get the time pressure, but a quick message to inform us would have helped.",2024-09-03 22:21:49
14997,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,You're right. I should've communicated better. What can we do now to make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 22:26:49
14998,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,Maybe we should set up regular check-ins? Even quick updates can keep everyone informed.,2024-09-03 22:27:49
14999,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. I'll make it a point to keep everyone in the loop moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:31:49
15000,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_3,Agreed. Let's also set clearer expectations for decision-making under pressure.,2024-09-03 22:39:49
15001,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_1,"Yes, that way we won't feel blindsided. Thanks for understanding, everyone.",2024-09-03 22:43:49
15002,deescalatory_conversation_493,speaker_2,I'm glad we talked this through. Let's get an A on this project!,2024-09-03 22:50:49
15003,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the group project without telling any of us.,2024-09-03 21:43:52
15004,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,I had to submit it by the deadline. No one else was stepping up.,2024-09-03 21:49:52
15005,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_3,But we agreed to review it together first. Now we all have to deal with any mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:59:52
15006,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but I didn't want to risk a late submission. Can we focus on how to move forward?",2024-09-03 22:04:52
15007,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,"Okay, let's figure out what needs to be fixed, then.",2024-09-03 22:06:52
15008,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_3,Did you at least follow the outline we discussed?,2024-09-03 22:12:52
15009,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"Yes, I followed the outline. There might be a few things that need adjustments, but the core is there.",2024-09-03 22:17:52
15010,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,Let's go through the sections together now and highlight any corrections.,2024-09-03 22:23:52
15011,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_3,Sounds good. I know we had some questions about the data interpretation part.,2024-09-03 22:31:52
15012,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_2,"I think I interpreted the data correctly, but I'm open to reviewing it if you found issues.",2024-09-03 22:40:52
15013,deescalatory_conversation_494,speaker_1,"Great, we can start there. Thanks for being willing to go over this again.",2024-09-03 22:47:52

15017,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I've been really swamped with school work. It's hard to manage both.",2024-09-03 21:54:57
15018,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,"I get that school is important, but our upcoming gig depends on everyone being serious about practice.",2024-09-03 22:03:57
15019,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"I know, and I really want to do a great job for the gig. Is there a way we can adjust the practice schedule?",2024-09-03 22:06:57
15020,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,We might be able to move the practice times a bit. When are you usually free?,2024-09-03 22:08:57
15021,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"Afternoons are better for me, right after classes.",2024-09-03 22:09:57
15022,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,"Okay, how about we shift practices to 4 PM? Would that work for everyone?",2024-09-03 22:19:57
15023,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_3,"4 PM works for me, but I have evening classes some days. What about 5 PM to give a little buffer?",2024-09-03 22:20:57
15024,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,"5 PM could work. How does that sound for you, speaker_2?",2024-09-03 22:24:57
15025,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_2,"Yeah, 5 PM is much better. Thanks for being flexible.",2024-09-03 22:33:57
15026,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_4,I can make 5 PM work too. Let's stick to this new schedule and see how it goes.,2024-09-03 22:39:57
15027,deescalatory_conversation_495,speaker_1,"Great, it sounds like we're all on board. Let's keep communicating if any issues come up.",2024-09-03 22:45:57

15032,deescalatory_conversation_496,speaker_3,"But we all have homework, Greg. You could've at least texted us.",2024-09-03 21:58:01
15033,deescalatory_conversation_496,speaker_2,"I know, Jake, but I lost track of time, okay?",2024-09-03 21:59:01

15036,deescalatory_conversation_496,speaker_3,It's not just about missing the meeting. It's about commitment to the team.,2024-09-03 22:14:01
15037,deescalatory_conversation_496,speaker_2,"I get that, Jake. I'll try to manage my time better from now on.",2024-09-03 22:17:01

15058,deescalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,"I'm so sorry, Emily. I didn't think it would be a big deal.",2024-09-03 21:53:07
15059,deescalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,It's a huge deal. That sketchbook has all my personal drawings.,2024-09-03 21:54:07
15060,deescalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,"I understand, but I just wanted to look at your art for inspiration. I should have asked you first.",2024-09-03 21:55:07
15061,deescalatory_conversation_498,speaker_1,You definitely should have. I felt really violated when I saw it missing.,2024-09-03 21:58:07
15062,deescalatory_conversation_498,speaker_2,I really apologize. I didn't mean to make you feel that way. Can I do anything to make it up to you?,2024-09-03 22:01:07

15069,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,I can't believe you went to the principal without talking to me first.,2024-09-03 21:46:11
15070,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,I thought I was doing the right thing by reporting the bullying.,2024-09-03 21:50:11
15071,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,But we were supposed to handle it as a team. You didn't even give us a chance to discuss it.,2024-09-03 21:59:11
15072,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,"I hear you, but the situation was getting out of hand. I felt like immediate action was needed.",2024-09-03 22:05:11
15073,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,So you didn't think talking to me could have been part of that immediate action?,2024-09-03 22:14:11
15074,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,Maybe I acted too quickly. Can we discuss a better way to handle things like this in the future?,2024-09-03 22:20:11
15075,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,I appreciate that. I just want to make sure we're on the same page next time.,2024-09-03 22:25:11
15076,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,Absolutely. How do you suggest we approach these situations going forward?,2024-09-03 22:33:11
15077,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,Let's agree to a quick huddle to talk about urgent matters before going to the administration.,2024-09-03 22:41:11
15078,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,That sounds fair. We can even set up a specific signal or code to indicate urgency.,2024-09-03 22:49:11
15079,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,"Great. That way, we can ensure both of our perspectives are considered.",2024-09-03 22:54:11
15080,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,And we'll be a stronger team because of it. Thanks for being open to this conversation.,2024-09-03 23:02:11
15081,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_1,Thank you for understanding. Let's make sure we stick to this plan.,2024-09-03 23:12:11
15082,deescalatory_conversation_499,speaker_2,Deal. We’ve got this.,2024-09-03 23:17:11
15083,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,Why did you borrow my notes without asking?,2024-09-03 21:44:14
15084,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,I didn't think it would be a big deal. I was desperate.,2024-09-03 21:45:14
15085,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,But you didn't return them in time for my study session!,2024-09-03 21:49:14
15086,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm really sorry. I just needed them to catch up.",2024-09-03 21:59:14
15087,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,You could've just asked. Communication goes a long way.,2024-09-03 22:09:14
15088,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,You're right. I should've asked first. It won't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:11:14
15089,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,It's not just about taking the notes. It's about trust.,2024-09-03 22:12:14
15090,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,I understand. I didn't mean to betray your trust.,2024-09-03 22:18:14
15091,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,"Next time, let's just be clear with each other, okay?",2024-09-03 22:20:14
15092,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to ask from now on. Can we move past this?,2024-09-03 22:24:14
15093,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_1,"Yes, we can. Just remember, honesty is key.",2024-09-03 22:29:14
15094,deescalatory_conversation_500,speaker_2,Absolutely. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:38:14
15095,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and posted that picture without asking me.,2024-09-03 21:48:17
15096,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, we were all having fun. Why are you so upset?",2024-09-03 21:58:17
15097,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,"Because that picture was really embarrassing, and now everyone at school can see it.",2024-09-03 22:05:17
15098,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it would bother you so much. Can we delete it?",2024-09-03 22:07:17
15099,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,"Deleting it would help, but you can't just assume things like this won't matter to other people.",2024-09-03 22:13:17
15100,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,You're right. I should've asked you first. I'll take it down right away.,2024-09-03 22:21:17
15101,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,"Thank you. In the future, just please ask me before posting any pictures of me.",2024-09-03 22:27:17
15102,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll make sure to do that from now on. I didn't mean to hurt you.",2024-09-03 22:32:17
15103,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,I appreciate that. Let's try to move past this and be more considerate.,2024-09-03 22:41:17
15104,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_2,Agreed. We'll be more mindful of each other's boundaries. Are we good now?,2024-09-03 22:46:17
15105,deescalatory_conversation_501,speaker_1,"Yeah, we're good. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:55:17
15106,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the project without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:40:21
15107,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but we were running out of time and I had to make a decision.",2024-09-03 21:49:21
15108,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,But it was a group project! We were supposed to work on it together.,2024-09-03 21:50:21
15109,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"You were busy with other responsibilities, and I couldn't get a hold of you. I didn't want us to miss the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:55:21
15110,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,You could have at least left a message or sent an email.,2024-09-03 21:57:21
15111,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have done that. I apologize. How do you think we can fix this?",2024-09-03 22:03:21
15112,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,"Well, we can start by reviewing the project together to make sure everything is as we both envisioned.",2024-09-03 22:06:21
15113,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. Do you have any specific concerns about the submission?,2024-09-03 22:09:21
15114,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,"Yes, I'm worried about the presentation format. Did you follow the guidelines we discussed?",2024-09-03 22:14:21
15115,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"I tried to stick to the guidelines, but there were a few last-minute changes. Let's go over them and make sure it's all correct.",2024-09-03 22:21:21
15116,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,"Okay, let's do that. Moving forward, we need to ensure better communication.",2024-09-03 22:25:21
15117,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_2,"Agreed. Next time, we'll set clear check-in points. How about a quick meeting every two days?",2024-09-03 22:35:21
15118,deescalatory_conversation_502,speaker_1,"That works for me. And if either of us can't make it, we should leave detailed",2024-09-03 22:41:21
15119,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for our study group again, Tom?",2024-09-03 21:47:24
15120,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,"I had a lot going on today. It slipped my mind, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:56:24
15121,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,This isn't the first time it's happened. We're all counting on each other to prepare for the exam.,2024-09-03 22:00:24
15122,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,"I know, and I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to let you guys down.",2024-09-03 22:09:24
15123,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,"Apologizing is great, but we need you to be reliable. What can we do to help you remember?",2024-09-03 22:11:24
15124,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,"Maybe if you send a reminder text a couple of hours ahead, it would help me keep on track.",2024-09-03 22:16:24
15125,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,"Sure, we can do that. But can you also set a reminder on your phone?",2024-09-03 22:22:24
15126,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,"Yeah, I definitely can. I’ll set it up right now.",2024-09-03 22:32:24
15127,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate it. We really need everyone putting in their part to pass this exam.",2024-09-03 22:36:24
15128,deescalatory_conversation_503,speaker_2,"Of course, I want us all to do well. I'll be more organized from now on.",2024-09-03 22:44:24
15129,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,"Why did you skip our study session, Mia? We agreed we'd meet before the physics exam.",2024-09-03 21:47:27
15130,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,"I had something more important come up, Johnny. Can't you just study by yourself for once?",2024-09-03 21:52:27
15131,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,We've been prepping together all semester. It feels like you ditched me last minute. What was so important anyway?,2024-09-03 21:55:27
15132,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,"My little brother had an emergency. I had to take care of him, okay?",2024-09-03 21:59:27
15133,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,"Oh, I didn't know that. Is he alright now?",2024-09-03 22:04:27
15134,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,"Yeah, he's fine now. But why do you always make me feel like I'm the bad guy?",2024-09-03 22:10:27
15135,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,I'm not trying to blame you. I just wish you'd let me know earlier so I could adjust my plans.,2024-09-03 22:14:27
15136,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,"I guess I could have sent a quick text. I'm sorry, it all happened so fast.",2024-09-03 22:20:27
15137,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,I understand that. Maybe we should find a backup plan for when unexpected things come up?,2024-09-03 22:27:27
15138,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,That sounds fair. What if we agree to share our notes online if either of us can't make it?,2024-09-03 22:34:27
15139,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,Good idea. We can also reschedule our sessions if needed. Let's make sure we communicate better next time.,2024-09-03 22:35:27
15140,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_2,"Agreed. I didn't mean to leave you hanging, Johnny. I value our study time too.",2024-09-03 22:45:27
15141,deescalatory_conversation_504,speaker_1,"Thanks, Mia. I appreciate your apology. Let's ace that physics exam together.",2024-09-03 22:52:27
15142,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and changed our project without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:49:31
15143,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,"I know, I'm sorry. I just thought the new design would work better and we were running out of time.",2024-09-03 21:59:31
15144,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"But we agreed to make decisions together, remember? It’s not just about what you think works best.",2024-09-03 22:09:31
15145,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,You're right. I should have consulted you first. How about we look at the changes together now and see what we can improve?,2024-09-03 22:14:31
15146,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"Okay, let's do that. I just wish we communicated better. If the changes made sense, I could have helped with them.",2024-09-03 22:21:31
15147,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,"I understand. I'll make sure to keep you in the loop from now on, and I'll value your input more.",2024-09-03 22:31:31
15148,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. So, walk me through the new design and we can combine our ideas.",2024-09-03 22:41:31
15149,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,Sure. I added more detailed graphics and reorganized the layout for better readability. What do you think?,2024-09-03 22:46:31
15150,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"The graphics look good, but the text seems a bit too small now. Maybe we can enlarge it and maintain the new layout?",2024-09-03 22:56:31
15151,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,That's a good point. How about we use a larger font and see if it still fits well with the design?,2024-09-03 23:00:31
15152,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_1,"Sounds like a plan. I think if we collaborate like this more often, we’ll finalize a great project. Let's get to it.",2024-09-03 23:10:31
15153,deescalatory_conversation_505,speaker_2,Absolutely,2024-09-03 23:12:31
15154,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me you were planning to switch departments, Amy?",2024-09-03 21:41:35
15155,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"I was going to, but I didn't think the timing was right, John.",2024-09-03 21:50:35
15156,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,"So, when exactly was the ""right"" time?",2024-09-03 21:52:35
15157,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"I don't know, I just figured I'd wait until things were less hectic.",2024-09-03 21:53:35
15158,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,But we're a team. We should be making these decisions together.,2024-09-03 22:02:35
15159,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,I didn't want to complicate things for you during the project deadline.,2024-09-03 22:06:35
15160,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,I would have appreciated knowing instead of finding out from someone else.,2024-09-03 22:11:35
15161,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,I see your point. I should have communicated better.,2024-09-03 22:19:35
15162,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,How long have you been thinking about this?,2024-09-03 22:22:35
15163,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"Honestly, a couple of months. The workload was just getting to be too much.",2024-09-03 22:28:35
15164,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,"If we'd known, maybe we could've managed the workload differently.",2024-09-03 22:35:35
15165,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,You're right. I didn't consider that. What do you think should be our next step?,2024-09-03 22:41:35
15166,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,Let's sit down and discuss what issues led you to this and see if we can find a solution together.,2024-09-03 22:46:35
15167,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,I think that's fair. I do want to make this work if possible.,2024-09-03 22:50:35
15168,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_1,Great. Let's schedule a time to talk in detail. We need everyone's input for the upcoming changes.,2024-09-03 23:00:35
15169,deescalatory_conversation_506,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for being open to discussing this, John.",2024-09-03 23:06:35
15170,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,Why did you take my idea and present it as your own in the meeting?,2024-09-03 21:48:37
15171,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,"I didn't mean to take credit for it, I was just trying to contribute to the discussion.",2024-09-03 21:57:37
15172,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,But you didn’t acknowledge that it was my idea. It feels unfair.,2024-09-03 22:04:37
15173,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,I see your point. I should have mentioned that it was your idea initially. I apologize for that.,2024-09-03 22:08:37
15174,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,Apology accepted. It's just frustrating when it seems like my work goes unrecognized.,2024-09-03 22:18:37
15175,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,"I understand. I appreciate your ideas and contributions, and I'll make sure to give you proper credit going forward.",2024-09-03 22:21:37
15176,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_1,Thank you. I think we can improve our collaboration if we communicate better.,2024-09-03 22:22:37
15177,deescalatory_conversation_507,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s make sure to keep each other in the loop and support each other’s contributions.,2024-09-03 22:24:37
15178,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,"James, why did you change the group presentation slides without telling us?",2024-09-03 21:46:40
15179,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,I thought it would make more sense to organize it differently. The original order seemed confusing.,2024-09-03 21:52:40
15180,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_3,"But we all agreed on the original order, James. It’s not fair to make changes last minute.",2024-09-03 22:00:40
15181,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,Exactly. Now we have to redo our speaking parts to match the new slides.,2024-09-03 22:10:40
15182,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it would cause such a problem. How about we go back to the original layout?",2024-09-03 22:14:40
15183,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_3,That sounds reasonable. We can stick to the plan we all agreed on.,2024-09-03 22:23:40
15184,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,"Yes, that's a good idea. We’re running out of time, so let’s just focus on making sure everyone knows their parts well.",2024-09-03 22:26:40
15185,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll switch the slides back right away. Let me know if there are any other concerns.,2024-09-03 22:34:40
15186,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_3,"Thanks, James. Let’s do a quick run-through to make sure everything aligns.",2024-09-03 22:43:40
15187,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_1,Good idea. It’ll help us make sure we’re all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:45:40
15188,deescalatory_conversation_508,speaker_2,I appreciate the feedback. Let's give it our best shot.,2024-09-03 22:52:40
15189,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you didn't pass me the ball, Alex. We were in a perfect position to score.",2024-09-03 21:44:43
15190,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,"Sarah, it's not that simple. I didn't see you clearly, and I thought Joe had a better chance.",2024-09-03 21:52:43
15191,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_3,But Joe was blocked by two defenders! It seemed obvious from where I was standing.,2024-09-03 22:01:43
15192,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,"I get that, but in the heat of the moment, I made what I thought was the best decision.",2024-09-03 22:03:43
15193,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,Maybe we should work on our communication signals during practice. It's important we trust and see each other on the field.,2024-09-03 22:05:43
15194,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_3,Definitely. We need to come up with some hand signals or something to make sure we know where everyone is.,2024-09-03 22:09:43
15195,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,"Agree, let’s talk to Coach about it. We need to be more synchronized as a team.",2024-09-03 22:14:43
15196,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"Good idea. And, Alex, I appreciate you explaining your perspective. I just want us to succeed.",2024-09-03 22:15:43
15197,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,"I want the same, Sarah. Let’s focus on improving our teamwork instead of pointing fingers.",2024-09-03 22:23:43
15198,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_3,"Alright, let's bring this up during the next practice and start working on better coordination.",2024-09-03 22:24:43
15199,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_1,"Sounds like a plan. Together, we can turn things around.",2024-09-03 22:30:43
15200,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_2,"Definitely. We all want to win, so let's support each other.",2024-09-03 22:37:43
15201,deescalatory_conversation_509,speaker_3,Agreed. Let’s make this count in our next game.,2024-09-03 22:46:43
15202,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"Why did you leave practice early yesterday, Alex? We're all putting in the hours and we need everyone.",2024-09-03 21:42:47
15203,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,"I had an emergency at home, Sam. I didn't think it would be a big deal if I missed just one practice.",2024-09-03 21:47:47
15204,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,It becomes a big deal when we're all trying to improve as a team. You should've at least told Coach or one of us.,2024-09-03 21:48:47
15205,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,"You're right, I should've communicated it better. I'm really sorry, but sometimes personal stuff just comes up.",2024-09-03 21:53:47
15206,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_3,"Hey, let's not gang up on Alex. We're all friends here, and we all know things happen. How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 21:57:47
15207,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"Fair enough. Maybe if we have a system in place for these situations, it would help? Like a group chat where we notify each other?",2024-09-03 22:03:47
15208,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,"I like that idea. I'll make sure to use it next time. Thanks, guys.",2024-09-03 22:05:47
15209,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_3,Great. Let's move past this and focus on our next game. We need to stay united.,2024-09-03 22:15:47
15210,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_1,"Agreed. We're a team, and we need to support each other, both on and off the field.",2024-09-03 22:18:47
15211,deescalatory_conversation_510,speaker_2,Absolutely. I appreciate you guys understanding. Let's get back to playing our best.,2024-09-03 22:19:47
15212,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,"Why didn’t you pass the ball to me, Sarah? I was wide open!",2024-09-03 21:41:51
15213,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,"I didn’t see you, John. I was trying to make a play myself.",2024-09-03 21:42:51
15214,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,You had your head down the whole time! You never look up to see who’s available.,2024-09-03 21:47:51
15215,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_3,"Hey both of you, let’s calm down. We’re a team and we need to work together. Sarah, do you think it’s something you can work on?",2024-09-03 21:48:51
15216,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,"Alright, maybe I do need to be more aware. But John, you’re not perfect either. You miss passes too.",2024-09-03 21:54:51
15217,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,"Fine, I know I do. I’ll try to be more precise. But it’s frustrating when we keep making the same mistakes.",2024-09-03 22:01:51
15218,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_3,"John, expressing frustration is fine, but how about suggesting ways we can improve? Like maybe some communication drills?",2024-09-03 22:07:51
15219,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,"Yeah, okay. Maybe shouting out when we’re open would help. Sarah, can you start doing that?",2024-09-03 22:16:51
15220,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,"Sure, I can do that. And John, can you start moving into more open spaces to make it easier for me to see you?",2024-09-03 22:21:51
15221,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_1,That’s fair. I’ll work on my positioning. Let’s try to improve this during our next practice. Deal?,2024-09-03 22:22:51
15222,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_2,Deal. Let’s get back to playing better as a team.,2024-09-03 22:31:51
15223,deescalatory_conversation_511,speaker_3,Great! That,2024-09-03 22:37:51
15224,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"Tim, I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball during the last play. We could have tied the game!",2024-09-03 21:45:57
15225,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,"Sarah, I didn't see you. The defense was all over me, and I had to make a quick decision.",2024-09-03 21:48:57
15226,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"That's not true. I was wide open, and you just ignored me.",2024-09-03 21:54:57
15227,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,"Look, I didn't ignore you on purpose. I was trying to focus on not losing the ball.",2024-09-03 21:58:57
15228,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing about this isn't going to help us win the next game.",2024-09-03 22:04:57
15229,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"Maybe, but Tim needs to trust his teammates more instead of trying to play hero.",2024-09-03 22:09:57
15230,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,"I get it, Sarah. I should have looked up more. I'll try to do better next time.",2024-09-03 22:16:57
15231,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_3,"And Sarah, maybe you can shout to get his attention in those situations. We all need to communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:19:57
15232,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"Fine, I'll yell louder, but Tim, you have to look for us too.",2024-09-03 22:22:57
15233,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,Deal. Let's just put this behind us and focus on how we can improve as a team.,2024-09-03 22:30:57
15234,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_3,"Agreed. We've got another game next week, and we need to work on our strategies, not our arguments.",2024-09-03 22:31:57
15235,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's go over some different plays at practice tomorrow. Maybe we can run a few drills for these kinds of situations.",2024-09-03 22:39:57
15236,deescalatory_conversation_512,speaker_2,Good idea. I think that'll help us,2024-09-03 22:47:57
15237,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball in the last game!,2024-09-03 21:42:02
15238,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,"I didn't see you open, I'm sorry. It was a hectic moment.",2024-09-03 21:45:02
15239,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,It always seems like you never see me open. Are you doing it on purpose?,2024-09-03 21:49:02
15240,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,"No, of course not. I really didn't realize; I'll try to be more aware next time.",2024-09-03 21:59:02
15241,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_3,"Hey, let's calm down. We're on the same team.",2024-09-03 22:06:02
15242,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,Easy for you to say. You're getting the passes.,2024-09-03 22:14:02
15243,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_3,I get that you're frustrated. Maybe we can review the game footage together and figure out what went wrong?,2024-09-03 22:18:02
15244,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,Fine. But it's more than just this game. It's been happening a lot.,2024-09-03 22:19:02
15245,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,"If it’s a broader issue, then we definitely should address it. I want us to work well together.",2024-09-03 22:22:02
15246,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_3,Why don't we all meet up after practice tomorrow to discuss how we can improve our communication during games?,2024-09-03 22:24:02
15247,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,Okay. Let’s do that. I just want to feel like I'm contributing more.,2024-09-03 22:29:02
15248,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_2,And I want to make sure you're part of the game.,2024-09-03 22:39:02
15249,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_3,"Great. By working on this together, we can become a stronger team.",2024-09-03 22:47:02
15250,deescalatory_conversation_513,speaker_1,"Alright, thanks, guys. I feel better about this already.",2024-09-03 22:50:02
15251,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,I saw you copying my test answers in the exam today.,2024-09-03 21:48:07
15252,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,What? I didn't copy your answers.,2024-09-03 21:58:07
15253,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,You were looking at my paper the whole time.,2024-09-03 22:06:07
15254,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"No, I was just looking around because I was nervous.",2024-09-03 22:12:07
15255,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,It's not fair. I studied really hard.,2024-09-03 22:13:07
15256,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"I studied too, but that last section was tough.",2024-09-03 22:19:07
15257,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"If we both get caught, we'll be in serious trouble.",2024-09-03 22:20:07
15258,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"I get it, but I wasn’t trying to get you in trouble.",2024-09-03 22:22:07
15259,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,Then why didn't you just ask for help earlier?,2024-09-03 22:24:07
15260,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"I thought I could handle it myself, but things got out of hand.",2024-09-03 22:31:07
15261,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,"Maybe next time, let's study together. We can help each other.",2024-09-03 22:36:07
15262,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,You're right. I don’t want either of us to get in trouble.,2024-09-03 22:40:07
15263,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,Let's just be honest with the teacher if she asks.,2024-09-03 22:48:07
15264,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,"Agreed, and let's make sure it doesn’t happen again.",2024-09-03 22:52:07
15265,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,Deal. We can learn from this and do better next time.,2024-09-03 23:00:07
15266,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_2,Definitely. I’m really sorry about all this.,2024-09-03 23:07:07
15267,deescalatory_conversation_514,speaker_1,It's okay. Let’s move on and do it the right way.,2024-09-03 23:12:07
15268,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,"Jake, you seriously left the kitchen in a mess again! I asked you to clean up yesterday.",2024-09-03 21:48:09
15269,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"I was really tired after work, Sarah. I’m sorry, I’ll clean it up now.",2024-09-03 21:57:09
15270,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,It’s not just about me cleaning up after you; it feels like you don’t respect my time.,2024-09-03 22:04:09
15271,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"I get that, and it’s not fair to you. Maybe we can set up a chore chart so it’s more balanced?",2024-09-03 22:09:09
15272,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,A chore chart could work. But what happens if one of us is too busy one day to follow it?,2024-09-03 22:16:09
15273,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"We can build in some flexibility, like letting the other person know if we need help or need to switch days.",2024-09-03 22:24:09
15274,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,That sounds more manageable. Maybe we can start with dividing up the main chores evenly?,2024-09-03 22:27:09
15275,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,Absolutely. I’ll take care of the dishes and vacuuming if you handle laundry and dusting.,2024-09-03 22:35:09
15276,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,Deal. Can we also agree to keep each other informed if plans change?,2024-09-03 22:42:09
15277,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"Yes, let’s make sure we communicate better moving forward. It’ll make things easier for both of us.",2024-09-03 22:50:09
15278,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_1,"Thanks for understanding, Jake. I’ll go ahead and make a draft of our chore chart tonight.",2024-09-03 22:55:09
15279,deescalatory_conversation_515,speaker_2,"I appreciate it, Sarah. I’ll help you once I’m done cleaning the kitchen.",2024-09-03 22:56:09
15280,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,"Maria, I didn't appreciate you taking credit for the project I initiated.",2024-09-03 21:45:11
15281,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,"Thomas, I didn't mean to take credit for it alone. I thought it was a team effort.",2024-09-03 21:51:11
15282,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,But you didn't mention my name at all during the presentation. It felt like you were dismissing my contributions.,2024-09-03 21:52:11
15283,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,I can see why you feel that way. I should have made sure to give you proper credit. Let's address this now. What can we do to make it right?,2024-09-03 22:00:11
15284,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Maybe we can issue a follow-up email to the team clarifying our contributions?,2024-09-03 22:02:11
15285,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'll draft the email and make sure it highlights your key role as well. Anything specific you want me to include?,2024-09-03 22:07:11
15286,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,"Yes, mentioning the initial concept development and the data analysis part would be great.",2024-09-03 22:11:11
15287,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll make sure to include those. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention calmly.",2024-09-03 22:18:11
15288,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_1,"Thanks, Maria. I just wanted to ensure our efforts are recognized correctly. Let's move forward positively.",2024-09-03 22:28:11
15289,deescalatory_conversation_516,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's make our next project even better by ensuring transparent communication from the start.,2024-09-03 22:32:11
15290,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,"Alex, you missed the rehearsal again. What's going on?",2024-09-03 21:42:14
15291,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"Sam, we've been rehearsing every day. I needed a break.",2024-09-03 21:48:14
15292,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,"Everyone needed a break, but we showed up. This isn't just about you.",2024-09-03 21:57:14
15293,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"I know, but I'm feeling overwhelmed. Was one rehearsal really that big of a deal?",2024-09-03 22:02:14
15294,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,It is when we're a week away from the concert. We're already struggling to get in sync.,2024-09-03 22:05:14
15295,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"Okay, I get that. What can I do to make it right?",2024-09-03 22:06:14
15296,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,Can you commit to not missing any more rehearsals? We really need you.,2024-09-03 22:14:14
15297,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"Yes, I'll be there. Maybe we can schedule some extra time to catch me up?",2024-09-03 22:15:14
15298,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,That sounds fair. How about we meet an hour earlier tomorrow?,2024-09-03 22:18:14
15299,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,"Sure, I can do that. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:20:14
15300,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,"No worries, let's just make sure we're all on the same page moving forward.",2024-09-03 22:27:14
15301,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll see you tomorrow then.,2024-09-03 22:29:14
15302,deescalatory_conversation_517,speaker_1,"See you then, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:38:14
15303,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,I can't believe you're accusing me of cheating on the group project!,2024-09-03 21:48:17
15304,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,"I saw you copy a whole section from an online source without citing it, what else was I supposed to think?",2024-09-03 21:58:17
15305,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"I was just collecting notes, I was going to rewrite that part. You didn't even ask me before assuming the worst.",2024-09-03 22:00:17
15306,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,"Okay, maybe I jumped to conclusions. Why didn't you mention you were still working on it?",2024-09-03 22:10:17
15307,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,"I thought it was obvious from the incomplete sections. Plus, we all agreed to verify each other's parts before submission.",2024-09-03 22:11:17
15308,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,"You're right, we should have communicated better. We need to be on the same page to pass this.",2024-09-03 22:15:17
15309,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's set up a meeting where we can finalize everything together.,2024-09-03 22:18:17
15310,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,Good idea. How about tomorrow evening?,2024-09-03 22:28:17
15311,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,Tomorrow evening works for me. I'll bring my laptop so we can all edit in real-time.,2024-09-03 22:37:17
15312,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,Perfect. Let's also make a checklist of what needs verifying.,2024-09-03 22:38:17
15313,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_1,I'll start the list and share it with the group tonight. Thanks for being open to this.,2024-09-03 22:41:17
15314,deescalatory_conversation_518,speaker_2,Thanks for clarifying. Let's make this project our best one yet.,2024-09-03 22:47:17
15315,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,"Why did you take my phone without asking, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:44:19
15316,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"I needed to make an urgent call, Sarah. I didn’t think you’d mind.",2024-09-03 21:54:19
15317,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,"But I do mind, Alex. It’s a matter of trust and respect.",2024-09-03 21:57:19
15318,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"I’m sorry, Sarah. I should have asked. I was just in a hurry.",2024-09-03 22:05:19
15319,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,"I understand you were in a rush, but it makes me uncomfortable when my things are taken without permission.",2024-09-03 22:10:19
15320,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"I get that, Sarah. In the future, I’ll make sure to ask you first, no matter what.",2024-09-03 22:16:19
15321,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,"Thank you, Alex. I appreciate that. Communication is important to avoid misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 22:22:19
15322,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"True, and I should have respected your personal space. I’ll be more mindful.",2024-09-03 22:26:19
15323,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,It means a lot that you understand. Let's both make an effort to communicate better.,2024-09-03 22:35:19
15324,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"Agreed. If there’s ever anything urgent, I'll definitely ask you directly.",2024-09-03 22:45:19
15325,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I’m glad we talked this out.,2024-09-03 22:46:19
15326,deescalatory_conversation_519,speaker_2,"Me too, Sarah. Thanks for being open.",2024-09-03 22:56:19
15327,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,"Why did you take my presentation slides without asking, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:43:21
15328,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,"I didn't think it would be a big deal, Maria. I was just trying to help.",2024-09-03 21:49:21
15329,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,But it's my project. You should've at least informed me.,2024-09-03 21:53:21
15330,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,I get that. I just wanted to make sure our team met the deadline. It wasn't meant to undermine you.,2024-09-03 22:02:21
15331,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,"I see your point, but it felt like you didn't trust me to handle it.",2024-09-03 22:06:21
15332,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,That's not true. I completely trust your work. I just thought integrating our ideas would make it stronger.,2024-09-03 22:09:21
15333,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,Maybe we should establish clearer roles next time to avoid this confusion.,2024-09-03 22:10:21
15334,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,Definitely. How about we set a meeting to delineate tasks before starting our next project?,2024-09-03 22:17:21
15335,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,"That sounds fair. And let's agree to always communicate any changes, no matter how small.",2024-09-03 22:24:21
15336,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,Agreed. I’m sorry for not consulting you first.,2024-09-03 22:27:21
15337,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_1,"Thanks, Alex. I really appreciate that.",2024-09-03 22:37:21
15338,deescalatory_conversation_520,speaker_2,"No problem, Maria. We're both aiming for the same goal after all.",2024-09-03 22:40:21
15339,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"Jacob, I can't believe you didn't tell us about the change in the project deadline!",2024-09-03 21:43:27
15340,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,"The email just came through this morning, Sarah. I was going to tell everyone at our meeting.",2024-09-03 21:51:27
15341,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"But now we're all scrambling, and some of us might not have time to adjust our schedules.",2024-09-03 21:56:27
15342,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,"I understand it's frustrating, Sarah. Jacob, can you walk us through what needs to be adjusted?",2024-09-03 22:05:27
15343,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,"Sure, the new deadline is three days earlier, so we'll need to accelerate some of our tasks, particularly the research section.",2024-09-03 22:15:27
15344,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"Okay, that helps, but we need better communication to avoid this in the future.",2024-09-03 22:25:27
15345,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,Agreed. How about setting up a quick group chat for urgent updates?,2024-09-03 22:31:27
15346,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,"I think that could work. Sarah, I apologize for the oversight. I'll make sure to inform everyone sooner.",2024-09-03 22:33:27
15347,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"Thanks, Jacob. Let's get through this adjustment together then.",2024-09-03 22:38:27
15348,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_3,"Great, so let's prioritize and delegate the remaining tasks. We can handle this.",2024-09-03 22:46:27
15349,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll reassign some tasks right now. Thanks for being understanding.",2024-09-03 22:54:27
15350,deescalatory_conversation_521,speaker_1,"Alright, let's get to work. We can do this if we all pull together.",2024-09-03 23:01:27
15351,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,I can't believe you're still upset about this.,2024-09-03 21:46:30
15352,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,Of course I'm upset. You completely ignored my input on the project.,2024-09-03 21:53:30
15353,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,I didn't ignore it; I just thought we needed to take a different direction.,2024-09-03 21:55:30
15354,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,You should have talked to me first. We’re supposed to be working as a team.,2024-09-03 22:00:30
15355,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,I understand that. Maybe I should have communicated better. What changes would you suggest now?,2024-09-03 22:08:30
15356,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,"For starters, I think we should reintroduce the original idea and see how it fits with the rest of the plan.",2024-09-03 22:09:30
15357,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Can you show me the parts you think are most important?,2024-09-03 22:12:30
15358,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,"Sure, I have them here. This part about user engagement is crucial.",2024-09-03 22:18:30
15359,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,I see your point. It does align well with our objectives. How can we integrate it with the current direction?,2024-09-03 22:27:30
15360,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,We could adjust the timeline slightly to incorporate these elements without derailing the whole project.,2024-09-03 22:32:30
15361,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,Adjusting the timeline makes sense. Let’s update the rest of the team about these changes.,2024-09-03 22:40:30
15362,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,Agreed. It’s important that everyone is on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:42:30
15363,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,Thanks for bringing this up. I’ll make sure to involve you more in future decisions.,2024-09-03 22:48:30
15364,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_2,I appreciate that. Let’s finish this project strong.,2024-09-03 22:58:30
15365,deescalatory_conversation_522,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let’s get to work,2024-09-03 23:02:30
15366,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot to submit the group project, Tim.",2024-09-03 21:49:34
15367,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,"I know, Sarah. I'm really sorry. I messed up.",2024-09-03 21:53:34
15368,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,Sorry doesn't cut it. This affects all of our grades.,2024-09-03 21:55:34
15369,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,"I get it, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to fix this.",2024-09-03 21:56:34
15370,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_3,Can we still submit it late and maybe explain the situation to the professor?,2024-09-03 21:59:34
15371,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,I doubt it. She’s pretty strict about deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:02:34
15372,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,What if I email her and take full responsibility? Maybe she’ll consider our effort.,2024-09-03 22:09:34
15373,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_3,"That might work, at least she’ll know we did the work and just had a submission issue.",2024-09-03 22:10:34
15374,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,"I don't know. It’s a long shot but worth a try, I guess.",2024-09-03 22:15:34
15375,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,"Okay, I'll email her right now. Should I send the project too, just in case she asks for it?",2024-09-03 22:22:34
15376,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_3,"Yes, send everything. Mention how much we worked on it together.",2024-09-03 22:32:34
15377,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,Fine. Just make sure you word it carefully. We need her to understand we all put in the effort.,2024-09-03 22:38:34
15378,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_2,"Got it. I really am sorry, guys. I never intended to mess things up for us.",2024-09-03 22:42:34
15379,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_3,Let's just focus on fixing it now.,2024-09-03 22:52:34
15380,deescalatory_conversation_523,speaker_1,"Yeah, let's see what the professor says. Hopefully, she'll give us a chance.",2024-09-03 23:00:34
15381,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me about the surprise party you were planning for Sarah?,2024-09-03 21:44:38
15382,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,"Because it's a surprise, and Sarah specifically wanted to be kept in the dark.",2024-09-03 21:45:38
15383,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,But I'm her best friend! I should have been included in the planning.,2024-09-03 21:53:38
15384,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to exclude you. We were trying to keep it small and intimate.,2024-09-03 21:57:38
15385,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,Small and intimate? You invited half the office!,2024-09-03 22:04:38
15386,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but we really tried to keep it to people Sarah sees regularly, and it got a bit bigger than expected.",2024-09-03 22:14:38
15387,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,I just feel really hurt that you didn't think to include me from the start.,2024-09-03 22:16:38
15388,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,I get that. Maybe we should have asked for your help to make it even better. Can we move past this and focus on making the party great for Sarah?,2024-09-03 22:19:38
15389,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,I suppose so. I just want to make sure she has the best birthday ever.,2024-09-03 22:24:38
15390,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,"Exactly, that's the most important thing. What can we do to make sure this party stands out?",2024-09-03 22:30:38
15391,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,"Well, we could add some of her favorite games and maybe get her favorite type of cake.",2024-09-03 22:31:38
15392,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_2,That sounds like a perfect idea. Let's do it together. How about we start planning the details right now?,2024-09-03 22:36:38
15393,deescalatory_conversation_524,speaker_1,"Sure, that sounds good. Let's make this the best surprise party she'll ever have.",2024-09-03 22:39:38
15394,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,"Why did you cancel our band practice again without telling anyone, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:45:42
15395,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,"I explained it before, Mike. I had an emergency come up at work.",2024-09-03 21:50:42
15396,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,But you didn't even text any of us. We were all waiting!,2024-09-03 21:54:42
15397,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. I should have communicated better. It was really hectic.",2024-09-03 22:02:42
15398,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_3,"It's not just about this one time, Sam. This has happened a few times already.",2024-09-03 22:12:42
15399,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,I didn't realize it was upsetting you all this much. What can I do to make it right?,2024-09-03 22:21:42
15400,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,How about giving us a heads-up at least a few hours in advance if something comes up?,2024-09-03 22:25:42
15401,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,That sounds reasonable. I'll make sure to do that from now on.,2024-09-03 22:33:42
15402,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_3,"And if you can't make it, maybe designate someone else to lead the practice?",2024-09-03 22:39:42
15403,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,Agreed. I can coordinate with Jess or Kyle for that.,2024-09-03 22:43:42
15404,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_1,"Thanks for understanding, Sam. We just want to make the most of our practice time.",2024-09-03 22:44:42
15405,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_2,"I get it, and I appreciate you guys bringing this up. Let's move forward and get back to making great music.",2024-09-03 22:53:42
15406,deescalatory_conversation_525,speaker_3,Sounds good to me. Let's plan our next practice with a backup just in case.,2024-09-03 22:59:42
15407,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"Jason, you could have passed the ball to me instead of taking that risky shot.",2024-09-03 21:44:45
15408,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,"But Emily, I thought I had a clear shot at the basket.",2024-09-03 21:54:45
15409,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,We were down by one point and there was only a minute left. We needed a more calculated play.,2024-09-03 21:59:45
15410,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,"I get that, but in the heat of the moment, I really thought I could make it.",2024-09-03 22:00:45
15411,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing about this won’t change the outcome of the game. We should focus on how we can improve.",2024-09-03 22:08:45
15412,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"You're right, Alex. Sorry, Jason, I didn’t mean to put all the blame on you.",2024-09-03 22:09:45
15413,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,"No worries, Emily. I should have trusted the team more. Next time, I’ll pass it.",2024-09-03 22:18:45
15414,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_3,We win as a team and lose as a team. Let’s make sure we communicate better on the court next time.,2024-09-03 22:28:45
15415,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,Agreed. We can also practice those last-minute plays during our next session.,2024-09-03 22:30:45
15416,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. Let's work on our strategy together.,2024-09-03 22:35:45
15417,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_3,Perfect. We'll only get better from here. Team on three?,2024-09-03 22:40:45
15418,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_1,"One, two, three...",2024-09-03 22:46:45
15419,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_2,Team!,2024-09-03 22:54:45
15420,deescalatory_conversation_526,speaker_3,Team!,2024-09-03 23:04:45
15421,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you took the project files home? We needed them for the presentation today!,2024-09-03 21:44:49
15422,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,I didn't realize everyone needed them that urgently. I was just trying to make some last-minute improvements.,2024-09-03 21:52:49
15423,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,"Yeah, but we agreed to finalize everything last night. Now we're behind schedule.",2024-09-03 21:57:49
15424,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,"I get that, but the presentation isn't until this afternoon. We still have some time to pull it all together.",2024-09-03 22:03:49
15425,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,But now we have to rush and fix any last-minute issues because we couldn't review it together.,2024-09-03 22:12:49
15426,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,"You're right, rushing isn't ideal. Let's focus on what still needs to be done and tackle it immediately.",2024-09-03 22:19:49
15427,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,"Okay, first let's quickly go over the slides and make sure there are no glaring errors.",2024-09-03 22:27:49
15428,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll open the file and we can go through it slide by slide.,2024-09-03 22:29:49
15429,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,"Good. And next time, please make sure to communicate if you need more time, so we can plan accordingly.",2024-09-03 22:32:49
15430,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,I will. Thanks for understanding. I'll try to be more mindful of the deadlines.,2024-09-03 22:38:49
15431,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_1,Great. Let's get this presentation in perfect shape. We can do this.,2024-09-03 22:40:49
15432,deescalatory_conversation_527,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's make it our best one yet.,2024-09-03 22:45:49
15433,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,Why did you take my idea and present it as your own in the team meeting?,2024-09-03 21:48:51
15434,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,I didn't think it was just your idea. We brainstormed it together.,2024-09-03 21:51:51
15435,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"We might have brainstormed, but the final concept was mine. You didn't even mention my input.",2024-09-03 21:55:51
15436,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,I see how that could be frustrating. I honestly didn't mean to take all the credit.,2024-09-03 22:02:51
15437,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,It felt like you were trying to outshine everyone. We're supposed to be a team.,2024-09-03 22:11:51
15438,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"Okay, I understand. I should have acknowledged your contribution. How can I make it right?",2024-09-03 22:12:51
15439,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"A start would be to clarify in the next meeting that it was a team effort, and specifically mention the work each of us did.",2024-09-03 22:17:51
15440,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"Agreed. I’ll do that. And next time, I'll make sure we're both on the same page before presenting.",2024-09-03 22:23:51
15441,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_1,"Thanks, that means a lot. Let's just communicate better to avoid these misunderstandings.",2024-09-03 22:24:51
15442,deescalatory_conversation_528,speaker_2,"Absolutely, we both have great ideas, and we should showcase them together.",2024-09-03 22:30:51
15443,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were struggling with the math project?,2024-09-03 21:44:54
15444,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"I didn't think it was a big deal, okay?",2024-09-03 21:52:54
15445,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,But now we're way behind schedule. We need to work together on this.,2024-09-03 21:53:54
15446,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"I get it, but you always make me feel like I'm not doing enough.",2024-09-03 22:02:54
15447,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,I don't mean to make you feel that way. I just want us to do our best.,2024-09-03 22:12:54
15448,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"Well, it's hard when I feel like you're always judging me.",2024-09-03 22:13:54
15449,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,I'm sorry if it comes across like that. Maybe we can figure out a way to communicate better.,2024-09-03 22:15:54
15450,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"Like, set specific times to update each other?",2024-09-03 22:21:54
15451,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,"Yes, that sounds good. And maybe we can tackle the tougher parts of the project together.",2024-09-03 22:24:54
15452,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"Yeah, I think that could work. I can handle the easy sections alone and we'll do the hard parts as a team.",2024-09-03 22:27:54
15453,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's start with the hardest part tomorrow and check in with each other every couple of days.,2024-09-03 22:30:54
15454,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_2,"Okay, that sounds fair. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:39:54
15455,deescalatory_conversation_529,speaker_1,No problem. We're in this together.,2024-09-03 22:42:54
15456,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,"Why did you take my bike without asking, Amy?",2024-09-03 21:45:57
15457,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"I needed to get to the library for an important assignment, Jack.",2024-09-03 21:49:57
15458,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,You could have at least told me. I was worried when I couldn’t find it.,2024-09-03 21:54:57
15459,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,I’m really sorry about that. I should have asked you first.,2024-09-03 22:00:57
15460,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,"It's just that this isn't the first time, Amy.",2024-09-03 22:05:57
15461,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"I know, and I’ll try to remember to ask in the future. Can you forgive me?",2024-09-03 22:07:57
15462,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,I don't want to be angry. I just want to have clear communication between us.,2024-09-03 22:17:57
15463,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"I completely understand. How about, from now on, I text you before taking your stuff?",2024-09-03 22:18:57
15464,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,"That would work. And maybe next time, we can find a way to share things more openly?",2024-09-03 22:21:57
15465,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Jack. Let’s agree to be more mindful of each other’s needs.",2024-09-03 22:22:57
15466,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_1,Sounds good to me. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:28:57
15467,deescalatory_conversation_530,speaker_2,Thanks for being patient with me. Let’s move forward from this.,2024-09-03 22:29:57
15468,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't submit the collaboration project on time, Mark.",2024-09-03 21:45:00
15469,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"Sarah, I told you I had a family emergency. I wasn't in the right mindset to get it done.",2024-09-03 21:49:00
15470,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"I understand emergencies happen, but you should have at least told me so I could handle it.",2024-09-03 21:50:00
15471,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have communicated that better. I apologize for not doing so.",2024-09-03 21:52:00
15472,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"Thanks for acknowledging that, Mark. It's just that this project was really important to me.",2024-09-03 21:53:00
15473,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"I get that, it was important to me too. Let's figure out a way to make up for the lost points.",2024-09-03 22:00:00
15474,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,Agreed. Maybe we can talk to the professor and explain the situation?,2024-09-03 22:02:00
15475,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I’ll join you in speaking with him. We can discuss how to possibly earn some extra credit.,2024-09-03 22:07:00
15476,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,"Perfect. Hopefully, he'll be understanding. Let's make sure it doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:12:00
15477,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,"Definitely. I'll keep you updated on any issues in the future, and I'll plan my time better.",2024-09-03 22:17:00
15478,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_1,Great. And I'll make sure we have backup plans just in case something comes up again.,2024-09-03 22:20:00
15479,deescalatory_conversation_531,speaker_2,Awesome. It's a relief we can work this out. Let's focus on finishing stronger next time.,2024-09-03 22:28:00
15480,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up for our band practice yesterday, Tom?",2024-09-03 21:46:03
15481,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"I had a lot of homework, Sarah. I told you earlier that my schedule was tight this week.",2024-09-03 21:52:03
15482,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,But you didn't even send a message to let us know. We were all waiting for you.,2024-09-03 21:53:03
15483,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"I get that, but I was really overwhelmed and forgot. I'm sorry about that.",2024-09-03 21:54:03
15484,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,"It's just that we've got the concert in two weeks, and we need everyone to be on board.",2024-09-03 22:00:03
15485,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,I understand. How about I make it up by practicing extra this weekend and sharing a recording?,2024-09-03 22:05:03
15486,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,"That could work, but we also need to make sure we communicate better. Can you set up reminders or something?",2024-09-03 22:14:03
15487,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"Yes, I can definitely do that. I'll set a phone alarm and also set up an online calendar for all of us.",2024-09-03 22:22:03
15488,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_1,That sounds like a good plan. Let's all commit to checking it regularly then.,2024-09-03 22:30:03
15489,deescalatory_conversation_532,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for understanding, and I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:40:03
15490,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,Why did you throw the ball to third base instead of home? We could've won the game!,2024-09-03 21:48:06
15491,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,"I thought the runner was going to stay at second. Things were moving fast, okay?",2024-09-03 21:55:06
15492,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_3,"Guys, yelling isn't going to solve anything. Let's figure out what happened and how we can improve next time.",2024-09-03 21:57:06
15493,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,I'm just frustrated. We were so close.,2024-09-03 21:59:06
15494,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,"I know, me too. But throwing blame around isn't helping.",2024-09-03 22:02:06
15495,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_3,Maybe we should go over different scenarios during practice to avoid this in the future.,2024-09-03 22:10:06
15496,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,"That's a good idea. It was a high-pressure situation, and I get that mistakes happen.",2024-09-03 22:16:06
15497,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. Let's make sure we communicate better on the field.,2024-09-03 22:26:06
15498,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_3,Agreed. Solid communication can really make a difference.,2024-09-03 22:32:06
15499,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_1,"Alright, let's focus on our next game. We've got a strong team, and we can do this.",2024-09-03 22:42:06
15500,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_2,"Yeah, let's channel this energy into winning the next one.",2024-09-03 22:48:06
15501,deescalatory_conversation_533,speaker_3,Sounds like a plan. We'll support each other and play smart.,2024-09-03 22:54:06
15502,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,Why did you change the presentation slides without telling me?,2024-09-03 21:50:09
15503,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,I thought they needed more visual appeal. I didn’t think it was a big deal.,2024-09-03 21:56:09
15504,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,But we agreed on the layout together. You should have at least consulted me first.,2024-09-03 22:01:09
15505,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,I see your point. I should have communicated that. What specifically didn't you like about the changes?,2024-09-03 22:08:09
15506,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,The colors and fonts are totally different from what we planned. It looks inconsistent now.,2024-09-03 22:18:09
15507,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,"Okay, I understand that. How about we go through the slides together and find a middle ground?",2024-09-03 22:25:09
15508,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,That sounds better. We need to make sure it still aligns with our overall theme.,2024-09-03 22:31:09
15509,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s take a few minutes to review the slides and blend both our ideas.,2024-09-03 22:34:09
15510,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_1,Thank you. I appreciate the collaboration.,2024-09-03 22:38:09
15511,deescalatory_conversation_534,speaker_2,I'm glad we could discuss this. Let's make this presentation the best it can be together.,2024-09-03 22:46:09
15512,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,"Why did you take my lunch from the fridge, Emma? I thought we agreed to respect each other's food.",2024-09-03 21:49:12
15513,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, Claire. I was in a rush this morning and didn't have time to pack my own. I should have asked you first.",2024-09-03 21:56:12
15514,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,"I get being in a rush, but this isn't the first time. How are we supposed to maintain trust as roommates if this keeps happening?",2024-09-03 21:58:12
15515,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,"You're right, Claire. I need to be more considerate. Is there something I can do to make it up to you?",2024-09-03 22:08:12
15516,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,"Well, maybe we can label our food more clearly, and you can replace what you took? That way, we both have what we need.",2024-09-03 22:18:12
15517,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,That sounds fair. I'll go grocery shopping this evening and buy you a replacement. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:27:12
15518,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,And maybe we could set some ground rules about sharing food? Just so we both know what to expect in the future.,2024-09-03 22:36:12
15519,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,I think that's a great idea. Let's sit down tonight and figure out some guidelines that work for both of us.,2024-09-03 22:37:12
15520,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_1,Perfect. I'm glad we can talk about this and find a solution together.,2024-09-03 22:41:12
15521,deescalatory_conversation_535,speaker_2,"Me too, Claire. Thanks for bringing it up calmly. I appreciate it.",2024-09-03 22:46:12
15522,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,"I really wish you would've asked before using my camera, Kate. It's really expensive.",2024-09-03 21:43:17
15523,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Ben. I didn't think it would be a big deal since we're roommates. I did handle it with care, though.",2024-09-03 21:44:17
15524,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,"It's not just about handling it with care. It's my personal belonging, and I use it for work. What if something had happened?",2024-09-03 21:46:17
15525,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"I understand your concern. I should've thought of that. If it helps, I'll cover any damage if it happens again.",2024-09-03 21:53:17
15526,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,"Knowing you recognize that would help. But, couldn't you have used your phone camera instead?",2024-09-03 22:02:17
15527,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,I was trying to take higher-quality photos for my art project. My phone just doesn’t have the same capability.,2024-09-03 22:07:17
15528,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,I get that. I guess I'm just protective of my equipment because it's my livelihood. Maybe next time we can discuss it first?,2024-09-03 22:13:17
15529,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll talk to you first next time. Maybe I can also help you with some of your projects to show I'm considerate of your things?",2024-09-03 22:21:17
15530,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,"That'd be great. Actually, a second pair of hands might be useful sometimes.",2024-09-03 22:31:17
15531,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_2,"Happy to help. Thanks for understanding, Ben. I'll make sure to respect your things from now on.",2024-09-03 22:40:17
15532,deescalatory_conversation_536,speaker_1,"Thanks, Kate. I appreciate you being willing to talk it out.",2024-09-03 22:42:17
15533,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,"We've been friends for years, but lately, you're never around when I need help.",2024-09-03 21:43:21
15534,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,"I know I've been distant, but my workload has been crazy, and I've been really stressed.",2024-09-03 21:47:21
15535,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,But you didn't even show up for my birthday last week. I thought that would mean something to you.,2024-09-03 21:48:21
15536,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,I truly am sorry for missing your birthday. I should have prioritized it better. Can we make it up and do something special together soon?,2024-09-03 21:53:21
15537,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,"I'd like that, but it still hurts that you weren't there. It feels like our friendship isn't important to you anymore.",2024-09-03 22:02:21
15538,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,"Your friendship is incredibly important to me. I need to manage my time better, and I promise to be more available. Can we try to move past this?",2024-09-03 22:04:21
15539,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,Okay. I appreciate you acknowledging it. I just want to feel like we inspire each other and support one another like we used to.,2024-09-03 22:07:21
15540,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,"I understand, and I miss that too. Let's set aside some time each week to catch up and do something fun together.",2024-09-03 22:15:21
15541,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,That sounds good. I think we both need to put in the effort to keep our friendship strong.,2024-09-03 22:23:21
15542,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's start this weekend. Maybe a hike or a movie night?,2024-09-03 22:24:21
15543,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_1,That sounds perfect. Thanks for being open to talking about this and making it right.,2024-09-03 22:26:21
15544,deescalatory_conversation_537,speaker_2,Thanks for understanding. Our friendship means,2024-09-03 22:32:21
15545,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"Why did you delete the project file, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:48:24
15546,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,"I didn't delete it, Sarah. I just moved it to a different folder to organize things better.",2024-09-03 21:55:24
15547,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,You should have told me before moving it! I spent hours looking for it.,2024-09-03 22:03:24
15548,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,I'm really sorry about that. I should've given you a heads-up. Where would you prefer I keep the files in the future?,2024-09-03 22:13:24
15549,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"Just leave them in the ""Completed Projects"" folder for now. It's easier for me to find them there.",2024-09-03 22:20:24
15550,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,"Got it, I'll make sure to do that from now on. Is there any way I can help you with the project now?",2024-09-03 22:27:24
15551,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"Actually, yes. Can you help me finalize the report? I'm running behind because of the lost time.",2024-09-03 22:36:24
15552,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll start working on the summary section now. Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 22:44:24
15553,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_1,"That works. Thanks for understanding, Alex.",2024-09-03 22:48:24
15554,deescalatory_conversation_538,speaker_2,"No problem, Sarah. Let's finish this strong together.",2024-09-03 22:52:24
15555,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and submitted the project without consulting me first.,2024-09-03 21:48:29
15556,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"You weren't available, and we were on a tight deadline. I had to make a decision.",2024-09-03 21:54:29
15557,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,But we always make decisions together as co-leaders. It feels like you disregarded our teamwork.,2024-09-03 21:56:29
15558,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,I understand why you feel that way. I really tried to follow the ideas we both discussed earlier.,2024-09-03 22:00:29
15559,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"I get that, but a quick message or call to update me would have been respectful.",2024-09-03 22:10:29
15560,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. What can we do to avoid this in the future?,2024-09-03 22:12:29
15561,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,Maybe set up a protocol for emergency situations where we can't reach each other.,2024-09-03 22:15:29
15562,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"That sounds like a solid plan. I'll make sure to run things by you next time, no matter the circumstance.",2024-09-03 22:21:29
15563,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate that. Let's review the submission together now and make any necessary changes.",2024-09-03 22:29:29
15564,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,Great idea. Let's see what can be improved and ensure we’re both happy with the final result.,2024-09-03 22:39:29
15565,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_1,"Alright, let’s get started. We still have a bit of time to polish it up.",2024-09-03 22:40:29
15566,deescalatory_conversation_539,speaker_2,"Perfect, I’m sure together we'll make it even better.",2024-09-03 22:47:29
15567,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,"Why did you change the project plan without telling me, Emma?",2024-09-03 21:45:33
15568,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,"I thought it would be more efficient. We were running out of time, Kevin.",2024-09-03 21:54:33
15569,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,But we've always discussed changes as a team. This is not how we operate.,2024-09-03 21:58:33
15570,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,You're right. I acted impulsively. I should have consulted you and the others first.,2024-09-03 22:00:33
15571,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,We need everyone on board to avoid misunderstandings. What made you think the change was necessary?,2024-09-03 22:01:33
15572,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,"I noticed we were falling behind on task deadlines. I wanted to speed things up, but I see now that communication is crucial.",2024-09-03 22:05:33
15573,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,"Can we review the changes together? That way, we can make sure everyone agrees and understands why they're necessary.",2024-09-03 22:14:33
15574,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's set up a meeting with the team to go over everything.,2024-09-03 22:19:33
15575,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,"Good idea. And next time, let's discuss any major changes before implementation. Agreed?",2024-09-03 22:22:33
15576,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,"Agreed. Thanks for bringing this up in a constructive way, Kevin.",2024-09-03 22:23:33
15577,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_1,"No problem, Emma. We're all aiming for the same goal here. Let's get back on track together.",2024-09-03 22:27:33
15578,deescalatory_conversation_540,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan. I'll notify the team about the meeting now.,2024-09-03 22:29:33
15579,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you took the car last night?,2024-09-03 21:48:36
15580,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,Because I knew you would overreact like you are right now!,2024-09-03 21:57:36
15581,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,I wouldn't overreact if you just communicated with me.,2024-09-03 21:59:36
15582,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,"Communicated? You've been so unreasonable lately, how am I supposed to talk to you?",2024-09-03 22:03:36
15583,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,Unreasonable? I'm concerned about our safety and responsibilities.,2024-09-03 22:08:36
15584,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,"I understand that, but you also need to trust me a little.",2024-09-03 22:10:36
15585,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,"Trust is built on honest communication. If you had just told me, maybe we wouldn't be arguing.",2024-09-03 22:18:36
15586,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,Maybe you're right. I should have mentioned it. But you also need to listen sometimes.,2024-09-03 22:20:36
15587,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,"I'm trying to, but it's hard when I feel left out of decisions.",2024-09-03 22:24:36
15588,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,I didn't mean to make you feel left out. I just didn't want to cause unnecessary issues.,2024-09-03 22:28:36
15589,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,"Can we agree to keep each other informed, even if it's uncomfortable?",2024-09-03 22:37:36
15590,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,"Yeah, I can do that. And I'll try to be more understanding when you worry.",2024-09-03 22:41:36
15591,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's work on being more open with each other.,2024-09-03 22:50:36
15592,deescalatory_conversation_541,speaker_2,Agreed. Communication goes both ways.,2024-09-03 22:55:36
15593,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead with the presentation without telling me, Maria.",2024-09-03 21:51:39
15594,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"David, I thought you were fine with it. You hadn't replied to my messages for two days.",2024-09-03 21:57:39
15595,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,"I was busy, but that doesn't mean you just take over everything.",2024-09-03 22:02:39
15596,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but someone had to step up. We were running out of time.",2024-09-03 22:04:39
15597,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,"Still, you could've waited or at least tried calling me.",2024-09-03 22:08:39
15598,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"You're right, I should've tried harder to reach you. It wasn't fair of me to make that decision alone.",2024-09-03 22:16:39
15599,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,I appreciate you saying that. It's just frustrating because we always plan these things together.,2024-09-03 22:23:39
15600,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"I know, and I value our teamwork. Maybe next time, we can set clearer deadlines to avoid this confusion.",2024-09-03 22:33:39
15601,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,"Yeah, having clearer deadlines sounds good. Can we also agree to update each other more frequently?",2024-09-03 22:40:39
15602,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,Absolutely. Weekly check-ins should help us stay on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:47:39
15603,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_1,"Okay, let's do that. And thanks for stepping in, even if it was rushed.",2024-09-03 22:55:39
15604,deescalatory_conversation_542,speaker_2,"Thanks for understanding, David. We'll work better together next time.",2024-09-03 23:04:39
15605,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,Why did you change our project topic without discussing it with the group first?,2024-09-03 21:50:44
15606,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,I thought it would be better to switch to something more manageable. The initial topic seemed too complex.,2024-09-03 21:51:44
15607,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,But we all agreed on the original topic. You should've talked to us before making such a big decision.,2024-09-03 21:52:44
15608,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have consulted with everyone. I just got worried about the deadline.",2024-09-03 21:56:44
15609,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_3,"I understand the concern about the deadline, but we can handle complexity if we plan well. Let's discuss how we can proceed from here.",2024-09-03 22:01:44
15610,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,"Agreed. So, should we go back to the original topic, or reconsider your new suggestion together?",2024-09-03 22:10:44
15611,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,Going back to the original topic might be best. We can manage it if we distribute the tasks properly.,2024-09-03 22:11:44
15612,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_3,That sounds good. Let's outline what needs to be done and figure out who will handle which parts.,2024-09-03 22:21:44
15613,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,I'll start working on the research part. What areas do you both want to take on?,2024-09-03 22:25:44
15614,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,I'll handle the data analysis. I feel comfortable with it.,2024-09-03 22:34:44
15615,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_3,Perfect. I'll focus on writing and editing the final report. Let's set up regular check-ins to keep everyone updated.,2024-09-03 22:42:44
15616,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_1,"Cool, let's schedule the first check-in for Friday. Does that work for everyone?",2024-09-03 22:44:44
15617,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_2,"Yes, Friday works for me.",2024-09-03 22:52:44
15618,deescalatory_conversation_543,speaker_3,Same,2024-09-03 22:59:44
15619,deescalatory_conversation_544,#### Scenario,A group project in college where one member feels they have been doing all the work.,2024-09-03 21:46:48
15620,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,"I've been working on our group project nonstop, and it seems like no one else is contributing.",2024-09-03 21:56:48
15621,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,That's not fair. I helped with the research last week.,2024-09-03 22:04:48
15622,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,And I worked on the presentation slides yesterday.,2024-09-03 22:07:48
15623,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,But I feel like I'm the only one pulling all-nighters for this.,2024-09-03 22:11:48
15624,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,Maybe we need to communicate better about what each of us is doing.,2024-09-03 22:18:48
15625,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,"Yeah, let's break down the tasks more clearly so we all know our responsibilities.",2024-09-03 22:25:48
15626,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,That would help. I just don't want to feel alone in this.,2024-09-03 22:26:48
15627,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,We don't want you to feel that way either. Let's sort out the remaining tasks.,2024-09-03 22:29:48
15628,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,Agreed. How about we list out everything left to do and assign them fairly?,2024-09-03 22:37:48
15629,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,Sounds good. I can start a shared document for us to fill in.,2024-09-03 22:42:48
15630,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,Great idea. We'll all check in on it every day to ensure we're on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:48:48
15631,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,And let's set up a regular meeting to discuss progress and any issues.,2024-09-03 22:55:48
15632,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_1,"Okay, I feel better about this now. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 23:04:48
15633,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_2,Thank you for bringing it up. We don't want anyone overwhelmed.,2024-09-03 23:10:48
15634,deescalatory_conversation_544,speaker_3,Absolutely. Let's make this project something we're all proud of.,2024-09-03 23:12:48
15635,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,"Why aren't you contributing to the group project, Julia? We all have to pull our weight here.",2024-09-03 21:48:52
15636,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,"I am contributing, Mike. Just because I haven't posted my part yet doesn't mean I'm not working on it.",2024-09-03 21:50:52
15637,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,But we have a deadline coming up. It's stressing everyone out when we don't see your input.,2024-09-03 21:58:52
15638,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,"I get that, but I work differently. I like to perfect things before sharing them.",2024-09-03 21:59:52
15639,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_3,"Could we maybe find a middle ground? Julia, could you show us a draft so we know we're on the same page?",2024-09-03 22:02:52
15640,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,I suppose I could do that. Would that make everyone feel better?,2024-09-03 22:10:52
15641,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,"Yes, that would help a lot. We're just trying to make sure we all stay aligned.",2024-09-03 22:13:52
15642,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,Fine. I'll upload what I have by the end of the day.,2024-09-03 22:14:52
15643,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_3,"That sounds like a good plan. Thanks, Julia.",2024-09-03 22:16:52
15644,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_2,You're welcome. I didn't mean to cause any stress. Let's just make sure we communicate better going forward.,2024-09-03 22:26:52
15645,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_1,Agreed. We'll all keep each other updated more frequently.,2024-09-03 22:34:52
15646,deescalatory_conversation_545,speaker_3,Perfect. Let's get back to work and finish this project strong.,2024-09-03 22:41:52
15647,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the project without telling me first.,2024-09-03 21:45:55
15648,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,I thought you were okay with the final draft we discussed yesterday.,2024-09-03 21:54:55
15649,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,We didn't finalize anything! There were still some changes needed.,2024-09-03 21:55:55
15650,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,"I understand your frustration, but we were running out of time. I thought it was better to submit it than risk a late penalty.",2024-09-03 21:56:55
15651,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,We could have asked for an extension. It's not just about the deadline; it's about getting it right.,2024-09-03 21:59:55
15652,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. How about we review what was submitted and see if we can improve it for the next part of the project?,2024-09-03 22:07:55
15653,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. I'm willing to work through it together. Let's make sure we're on the same page next time.,2024-09-03 22:16:55
15654,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's set a schedule to review each step before making any final decisions.,2024-09-03 22:19:55
15655,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_1,Good plan. Thanks for being willing to fix this together.,2024-09-03 22:22:55
15656,deescalatory_conversation_546,speaker_2,"No problem. We're a team, and it's important we both feel good about the work we submit.",2024-09-03 22:24:55
15657,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and talked to the client without telling me.,2024-09-03 21:50:00
15658,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,I thought it was the best way to handle the situation quickly. We were on a tight deadline.,2024-09-03 21:55:00
15659,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,But I was the project lead! Any major step like that should go through me first.,2024-09-03 21:59:00
15660,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,I understand you're upset. I should have informed you. I just didn't want to waste any time.,2024-09-03 22:06:00
15661,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,It's not just about time. It's about trust. How am I supposed to lead effectively if you're making decisions solo?,2024-09-03 22:13:00
15662,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,You're right. Communication is crucial for our teamwork. How can we improve that moving forward?,2024-09-03 22:19:00
15663,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,I appreciate you asking. Maybe we can set up brief check-in meetings every morning to keep everyone on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:22:00
15664,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. I'll make sure to keep you informed of any significant steps from now on.,2024-09-03 22:31:00
15665,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's try to work together on this and avoid any misunderstandings in the future.,2024-09-03 22:41:00
15666,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's finish this project strong as a team.,2024-09-03 22:48:00
15667,deescalatory_conversation_547,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's get back to work and ensure we're delivering our best for the client.,2024-09-03 22:49:00
15668,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,"Hey, I noticed you've been taking longer breaks than usual. It's starting to impact the project deadlines.",2024-09-03 21:51:04
15669,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,What? I've been working as hard as everyone else. Maybe you should check your own time management first.,2024-09-03 21:58:04
15670,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,"Look, I'm not accusing you of slacking off. I'm just trying to figure out how we can all stay on track. Can we discuss this?",2024-09-03 22:03:04
15671,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,I guess. But it feels like you're singling me out.,2024-09-03 22:06:04
15672,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,I'm sorry if it seemed that way. My intention is to make sure we all meet our goals. Can we brainstorm ways to stay more focused?,2024-09-03 22:09:04
15673,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,"I appreciate that. Maybe we could set shorter, more frequent milestones. That might help everyone stay on task.",2024-09-03 22:17:04
15674,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,That sounds like a great idea. We can also do quick check-ins throughout the day to ensure we're all on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:20:04
15675,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,Agreed. And we can remind each other to stick to the schedule without making it feel like we're being watched.,2024-09-03 22:24:04
15676,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_1,Perfect. Let’s give it a try starting tomorrow. Thanks for being open to discussing this.,2024-09-03 22:32:04
15677,deescalatory_conversation_548,speaker_2,No problem. I’m glad we talked it out. Let’s get this project back on track together.,2024-09-03 22:40:04
15678,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,"Why did you ignore my email about the project deadline, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:47:07
15679,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"I didn't ignore it, John. I was busy with other assignments and I thought we had more time.",2024-09-03 21:55:07
15680,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,But the deadline is tomorrow! Our grades depend on this.,2024-09-03 22:05:07
15681,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"I understand, but you could have reminded me verbally. Emails can get buried in my inbox.",2024-09-03 22:10:07
15682,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,I did mention it in class last week. Didn’t you hear?,2024-09-03 22:13:07
15683,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,I guess I missed that. Can we focus on what we can do now to meet the deadline?,2024-09-03 22:15:07
15684,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,Sure. What's left for us to complete?,2024-09-03 22:17:07
15685,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,We need to finish the presentation slides and practice our parts. Have you done the research?,2024-09-03 22:27:07
15686,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,"Yes, I have all the data ready. Do you have the design template?",2024-09-03 22:37:07
15687,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,I do. I’ll start merging the content into the slides. Can you work on the speaking notes?,2024-09-03 22:45:07
15688,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let's divide the sections and make sure we each know our parts well.,2024-09-03 22:53:07
15689,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,Great. I’ll take the introduction and conclusion. You handle the main content.,2024-09-03 22:55:07
15690,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,Agreed. How about we meet again in two hours to review everything?,2024-09-03 23:03:07
15691,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_2,"Two hours works for me. Let’s make this our best presentation yet, despite the rush.",2024-09-03 23:09:07
15692,deescalatory_conversation_549,speaker_1,"Absolutely, Sarah. We got this.",2024-09-03 23:15:07
15693,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,"Why did you use my research without giving me credit, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:49:10
15694,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, Sarah. We’re both on the same project.",2024-09-03 21:50:10
15695,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,It is a big deal. My contribution should be acknowledged.,2024-09-03 21:57:10
15696,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"Okay, I see your point. I just thought it’d be faster this way.",2024-09-03 22:02:10
15697,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,"Faster, maybe, but it's not fair to me.",2024-09-03 22:04:10
15698,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,You're right. I should have talked to you first. How can I make it right?,2024-09-03 22:11:10
15699,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,Acknowledging my work in the presentation would be a good start.,2024-09-03 22:16:10
15700,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll make sure to update the presentation slides.,2024-09-03 22:25:10
15701,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,"Thank you. And for future reference, can we discuss our contributions beforehand?",2024-09-03 22:26:10
15702,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,Absolutely. Communication is key. Let’s schedule regular check-ins.,2024-09-03 22:29:10
15703,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_1,Sounds good. I appreciate your understanding.,2024-09-03 22:34:10
15704,deescalatory_conversation_550,speaker_2,"No problem. Teamwork is important, and I want us both to succeed.",2024-09-03 22:35:10
15705,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,"Why did you take my lunch from the fridge, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:49:13
15706,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,"I didn't realize it was yours, John. There was no name on it.",2024-09-03 21:50:13
15707,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,But you know I always bring that lunchbox. How could you not recognize it?,2024-09-03 21:53:13
15708,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,I guess I wasn't paying attention. I'm really sorry about that.,2024-09-03 22:01:13
15709,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,"It's not just about the lunch, it's about respecting each other's stuff.",2024-09-03 22:04:13
15710,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,I totally get that. How about I replace it tomorrow and we set up a system to label our food?,2024-09-03 22:11:13
15711,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,That sounds fair. I appreciate that you're willing to fix it.,2024-09-03 22:15:13
15712,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,Of course. We live together; we've got to make this work.,2024-09-03 22:23:13
15713,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,Absolutely. Let's put our names on everything to avoid this in the future.,2024-09-03 22:29:13
15714,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_2,"Agreed. And again, sorry for the misunderstanding. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:32:13
15715,deescalatory_conversation_551,speaker_1,Thanks. I appreciate the effort.,2024-09-03 22:42:13
15716,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,Why didn't you tell me you were going to delete the database?,2024-09-03 21:47:16
15717,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,Because you were away and it needed to be done urgently.,2024-09-03 21:55:16
15718,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,But you know I have backups that need updating first!,2024-09-03 22:02:16
15719,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,I thought ensuring we had a clean start was more important.,2024-09-03 22:09:16
15720,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,We could've lost critical client information.,2024-09-03 22:15:16
15721,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,"I understand that now, but at the moment, I believed speed was crucial.",2024-09-03 22:25:16
15722,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,"Next time, at least leave a message. We need communication for this to work.",2024-09-03 22:32:16
15723,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,"You're right, I'm sorry. Let's create a protocol for urgent actions.",2024-09-03 22:36:16
15724,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,Agreed. Perhaps a shared calendar for such tasks?,2024-09-03 22:43:16
15725,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,"Yes, and maybe a WhatsApp group for immediate updates.",2024-09-03 22:44:16
15726,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_1,That sounds reasonable. Can we restore the database from my last backup?,2024-09-03 22:49:16
15727,deescalatory_conversation_552,speaker_2,Let's do that now and then formalize our new communication protocol.,2024-09-03 22:57:16
15728,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,"Why didn't you show up to the group rehearsal yesterday, Jake?",2024-09-03 21:48:18
15729,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,"I had something come up last minute, Sarah. Why are you making such a big deal out of it?",2024-09-03 21:53:18
15730,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,Because we needed you there! We're playing at the talent show next week.,2024-09-03 21:59:18
15731,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_3,"Guys, let's calm down. Jake, we needed to review the new song. What happened?",2024-09-03 22:07:18
15732,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, Rachel. I didn't have a choice.",2024-09-03 22:15:18
15733,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,"Okay, but you didn't even text us to let us know.",2024-09-03 22:20:18
15734,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,"I know, I messed up. I'm sorry about that. Can we focus on practice now?",2024-09-03 22:30:18
15735,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_3,That's fair. Let's set another rehearsal for this weekend. Can everyone make it?,2024-09-03 22:40:18
15736,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_1,I can do Saturday afternoon.,2024-09-03 22:45:18
15737,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_2,"That works for me too. Thanks for understanding, guys.",2024-09-03 22:52:18
15738,deescalatory_conversation_553,speaker_3,"Alright, Saturday it is. Remember, we're all in this together.",2024-09-03 22:54:18
15739,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,"I can't believe you would cheat on the history exam, Alex. You know how important this is!",2024-09-03 21:52:23
15740,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,"Mrs. Thompson, I didn't cheat. I just took some extra notes because I was really stressed about it.",2024-09-03 21:53:23
15741,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,"Keeping extra notes during the exam is against the rules, Alex. Why didn't you come to me if you were stressed?",2024-09-03 22:03:23
15742,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,I thought I could handle it on my own. I didn't want you to think I was struggling.,2024-09-03 22:05:23
15743,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,"It's natural to struggle sometimes, Alex. But breaking the rules isn't the answer. It doesn't help you learn, and it isn't fair to others.",2024-09-03 22:09:23
15744,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,"I understand that now. I'm sorry, Mrs. Thompson. I just felt a lot of pressure to do well.",2024-09-03 22:17:23
15745,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,"Apologizing is a good start, Alex. We need to discuss the consequences. How can we work together to make sure this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 22:20:23
15746,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,Maybe I could come to you for extra help after school? I don't want this to happen again either.,2024-09-03 22:26:23
15747,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,"That sounds like a positive step. Additionally, how about we set up a weekly check-in to go over any areas you're struggling with?",2024-09-03 22:33:23
15748,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_2,I'd appreciate that a lot. Thank you for giving me another chance.,2024-09-03 22:36:23
15749,deescalatory_conversation_554,speaker_1,Everyone deserves a chance to learn from their mistakes. Let's focus on improving from here.,2024-09-03 22:41:23
15750,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,"You took my design without asking, Steve.",2024-09-03 21:50:28
15751,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"I didn’t think you’d mind, Laura. It’s for the same project.",2024-09-03 21:51:28
15752,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,That’s not the point. You should have consulted me first.,2024-09-03 21:57:28
15753,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"Alright, I get that. Can we talk about how to move forward with it?",2024-09-03 22:06:28
15754,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,"Yes, let’s. How do you plan to use it?",2024-09-03 22:14:28
15755,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,I was thinking of integrating it into the main presentation. Is that okay with you?,2024-09-03 22:19:28
15756,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,I’d prefer if we both worked on it together. Can we do that?,2024-09-03 22:20:28
15757,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"Sure, I’m open to collaborating. When are you free to work on it?",2024-09-03 22:23:28
15758,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,I’m available after lunch today. Does that work for you?,2024-09-03 22:24:28
15759,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,That works for me too. Let’s meet in the conference room then.,2024-09-03 22:27:28
15760,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,Great. Can we also review the other sections while we’re at it?,2024-09-03 22:29:28
15761,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let’s make sure everything aligns with our goals.,2024-09-03 22:32:28
15762,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,"Sounds like a plan. Thanks for being open to this, Steve.",2024-09-03 22:33:28
15763,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,"No problem, Laura. Team effort, right?",2024-09-03 22:38:28
15764,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_1,Definitely. See you later then.,2024-09-03 22:39:28
15765,deescalatory_conversation_555,speaker_2,See you at lunch.,2024-09-03 22:48:28
15766,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,"I can't believe you messed up the presentation slides again, Simon. This is the third time!",2024-09-03 21:46:32
15767,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Emma. I know it's frustrating, but I had a lot on my plate this week.",2024-09-03 21:47:32
15768,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,We all have a lot on our plate. Can't you manage your time better?,2024-09-03 21:49:32
15769,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,I get where you're coming from. Maybe I need to rethink how I organize my time. Do you have any suggestions?,2024-09-03 21:50:32
15770,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,"Well, for starters, maybe you should prioritize the tasks that are due sooner. Did you try using a planner or something?",2024-09-03 21:58:32
15771,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,"I did, but I guess I wasn’t diligent about it. I'll make sure to stick to it more closely next time. Can you go over the deadlines with me again?",2024-09-03 22:03:32
15772,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,"Sure, let's review them now. And maybe we can set smaller milestones so it doesn't feel so overwhelming.",2024-09-03 22:09:32
15773,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,That sounds like a good idea. Thanks for being understanding and helping me out with this.,2024-09-03 22:17:32
15774,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_1,"No problem, Simon. We're a team, and we need to make sure we stay on track together.",2024-09-03 22:18:32
15775,deescalatory_conversation_556,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll start updating the slides right away. Let's make this presentation great!,2024-09-03 22:21:32
15776,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,I can't believe you went ahead and published the article without my input.,2024-09-03 21:49:36
15777,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,"I had to meet the deadline, and you weren't available.",2024-09-03 21:53:36
15778,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,I told you I was working on gathering more information. We could have asked for an extension.,2024-09-03 22:03:36
15779,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,Extensions aren't easy to get. The editor would have been livid.,2024-09-03 22:05:36
15780,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,"Still, you should have talked to me first. We're supposed to be partners on this.",2024-09-03 22:09:36
15781,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,I understand. I should have communicated better. Can we fix the article together now?,2024-09-03 22:16:36
15782,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,We definitely need to. Some of the facts are incomplete.,2024-09-03 22:20:36
15783,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,"Alright, let's go through it point by point. What areas need more information?",2024-09-03 22:22:36
15784,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,"The section about the local government funding, for one. I had more details on that.",2024-09-03 22:31:36
15785,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,Got it. I'll make the edits as you explain. Anything else?,2024-09-03 22:36:36
15786,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,"Yes, and the interview with the community leader was missing key quotes.",2024-09-03 22:41:36
15787,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,I can add those in. Do you have the notes with you?,2024-09-03 22:43:36
15788,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,"Yes, I'll read them out to you. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:48:36
15789,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,No problem. Let's make this article the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:55:36
15790,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_1,"Alright, starting with the funding details: they allocated an additional $100,000 for the project.",2024-09-03 23:04:36
15791,deescalatory_conversation_557,speaker_2,Adding that in now. Let's,2024-09-03 23:07:36
15792,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me about the change in the project deadline, Sam?",2024-09-03 21:50:39
15793,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,"I only found out yesterday, Karen. I was going to tell you today.",2024-09-03 21:59:39
15794,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,But you know we needed more time to prepare. Now we're stuck.,2024-09-03 22:09:39
15795,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,"I get it, but we can still make it work if we split the tasks differently.",2024-09-03 22:15:39
15796,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,How do you propose we do that? We have so much left to do.,2024-09-03 22:21:39
15797,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,Let's list out what needs to be done and prioritize. We can handle this if we stay organized.,2024-09-03 22:28:39
15798,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,"Fine, but we can't afford any more surprises. Communication needs to be better.",2024-09-03 22:33:39
15799,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,"Agreed. From now on, we’ll update each other immediately about any changes.",2024-09-03 22:42:39
15800,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,"Alright, let's get started. Which tasks should we tackle first?",2024-09-03 22:45:39
15801,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,We should start with the research part. I'll take the first half and you take the second half. Does that work?,2024-09-03 22:46:39
15802,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,"That sounds good. And after research, we can move on to the presentation slides together.",2024-09-03 22:49:39
15803,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,"Yes, exactly. We should set check-in points to make sure we are on track.",2024-09-03 22:51:39
15804,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_1,Great. I feel a bit more confident about finishing this now. Thanks for being flexible.,2024-09-03 23:01:39
15805,deescalatory_conversation_558,speaker_2,No problem. Let's just make sure we keep each other in the loop moving forward.,2024-09-03 23:08:39
15806,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,"I can't believe you went ahead and submitted the project without consulting me, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:51:43
15807,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"Jake, I submitted it because the deadline was approaching. We needed to turn it in.",2024-09-03 21:59:43
15808,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,But we agreed to review the final draft together. You didn't even ask for my input.,2024-09-03 22:01:43
15809,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"I get that you're upset, but I thought getting it in on time was more important. I didn't mean to undermine you.",2024-09-03 22:02:43
15810,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,"Well, I feel like my contributions were overlooked. I worked hard on this, too.",2024-09-03 22:08:43
15811,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"I understand, and I'm sorry if it seemed that way. What can we do to make sure this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 22:11:43
15812,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,"Maybe next time, we can set a reminder to review it a day before the deadline. That way we're both on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:19:43
15813,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,That's a good idea. I'll make sure we stick to that plan next time.,2024-09-03 22:24:43
15814,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sarah. I just want to make sure we both feel valued in our work.",2024-09-03 22:31:43
15815,deescalatory_conversation_559,speaker_2,"Of course, Jake. Your input is important to me, and I didn't mean to ignore that. Let's learn from this and move forward.",2024-09-03 22:40:43
15816,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"Jason, you know that project proposal was due today, right?",2024-09-03 21:46:46
15817,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,"Yeah, Sarah, I turned it in. Why?",2024-09-03 21:49:46
15818,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"I checked the submission, and it's missing the budget breakdown.",2024-09-03 21:56:46
15819,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,"Oh, really? I thought I included it. Let me look again.",2024-09-03 21:57:46
15820,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"This is a big deal, Jason. We can't afford to miss any details.",2024-09-03 22:06:46
15821,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,"I understand, Sarah. I'll check right now. Can you give me a minute?",2024-09-03 22:16:46
15822,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"Sure, but we also need to talk about dividing tasks more clearly. This keeps happening.",2024-09-03 22:25:46
15823,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,You're right. Maybe we should outline responsibilities more explicitly moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:27:46
15824,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,That sounds good. Did you find the budget document?,2024-09-03 22:32:46
15825,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,"Yes, it looks like I saved it in the wrong folder. I'm fixing it now.",2024-09-03 22:33:46
15826,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"Okay, great. Just upload it ASAP. And let's have a quick meeting later to clarify task assignments.",2024-09-03 22:39:46
15827,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll send the budget update in the next five minutes. Thanks for pointing it out.,2024-09-03 22:40:46
15828,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,No problem. Good to address this now rather than later.,2024-09-03 22:44:46
15829,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,Absolutely. We both want this project to succeed.,2024-09-03 22:50:46
15830,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_1,"Exactly. Let's meet at 3 PM to discuss the tasks, then?",2024-09-03 22:51:46
15831,deescalatory_conversation_560,speaker_2,3 PM works for me. See you then.,2024-09-03 22:52:46
15832,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,I can't believe you changed the project outline without discussing it with us first.,2024-09-03 21:43:50
15833,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"I did it because the deadline was moving up, and we needed to streamline our tasks!",2024-09-03 21:53:50
15834,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_3,But you made those changes without any input from the rest of the group. It's not fair.,2024-09-03 21:56:50
15835,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,"Exactly. We all need to be on the same page, especially since this affects our grades.",2024-09-03 22:05:50
15836,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,I was just trying to help us meet the deadline. Maybe we can review the changes together now?,2024-09-03 22:10:50
15837,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_3,That would be a good start. We need to ensure everyone's ideas are considered.,2024-09-03 22:13:50
15838,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,How about we go through the new outline and suggest any necessary revisions?,2024-09-03 22:17:50
15839,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"Sure, let's do that. I didn't mean to overstep, just wanted to keep us on track.",2024-09-03 22:22:50
15840,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_3,We appreciate that. Let's just make sure we communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:31:50
15841,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,Agreed. Clear communication is key for teamwork. Let's get started on the revisions then.,2024-09-03 22:33:50
15842,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,"Thanks, guys. I’ll share the updated document now.",2024-09-03 22:41:50
15843,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_3,Looking at it together will help us finish up on time and ensure everyone’s input is included.,2024-09-03 22:44:50
15844,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_1,Perfect. Let's aim to have a draft ready by tomorrow so we can finalize everything.,2024-09-03 22:49:50
15845,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_2,I'll stay late tonight if needed to incorporate everyone's feedback.,2024-09-03 22:50:50
15846,deescalatory_conversation_561,speaker_3,Same here. Team effort all the,2024-09-03 22:56:50
15847,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,"Why did you think it was okay to leave me out of the project meeting, Rachel?",2024-09-03 21:47:54
15848,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,"It wasn’t intentional, Sam. The meeting was scheduled last minute, and we didn’t have time to inform everyone.",2024-09-03 21:57:54
15849,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,But I’m a key member of the team. How can decisions be made without my input?,2024-09-03 21:59:54
15850,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_3,"I understand your frustration, Sam. We did make some quick decisions, but nothing is set in stone. We can go over everything together now if that helps.",2024-09-03 22:09:54
15851,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,"It’s just disappointing to feel excluded, you know? I want to contribute as much as everyone else.",2024-09-03 22:17:54
15852,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_4,"We value your input, Sam. Maybe we can establish a more reliable way to ensure everyone is informed of last-minute meetings?",2024-09-03 22:18:54
15853,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,"That's a good idea, Tom. Maybe a group chat or a shared calendar where we can all see any sudden schedule changes might help?",2024-09-03 22:20:54
15854,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_1,"I’d appreciate that. Communication issues have been an ongoing problem, don’t you think?",2024-09-03 22:22:54
15855,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_3,"Yes, definitely. And honestly, we all need to be more diligent about keeping each other in the loop.",2024-09-03 22:25:54
15856,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_2,"Agreed. Let’s make a pact to do better in the future. We’re all on this team for a reason, after all.",2024-09-03 22:32:54
15857,deescalatory_conversation_562,speaker_4,"Absolutely. Each one of us brings something important to the table. Shall we review the meeting details now, Sam",2024-09-03 22:36:54
15858,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,Why didn't you finish the project report like we agreed?,2024-09-03 21:44:57
15859,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,"I tried, but I just didn't understand some of the data you collected.",2024-09-03 21:48:57
15860,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,You should have asked me for help instead of leaving it unfinished.,2024-09-03 21:58:57
15861,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,I didn't want to bother you; you seemed really busy with your own tasks.,2024-09-03 22:02:57
15862,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, but teamwork means we need to communicate. What part of the data confused you?",2024-09-03 22:11:57
15863,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,Mostly the financial projections. They just didn't make sense to me.,2024-09-03 22:15:57
15864,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,"Okay, I can see how they might be confusing. I rushed through that part a bit. Want to go over it together now?",2024-09-03 22:18:57
15865,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks for understanding.",2024-09-03 22:28:57
15866,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,"No problem. Next time, just let me know sooner. We're both responsible for this project, and I don't want us to fall behind.",2024-09-03 22:33:57
15867,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_2,You're right. I'll definitely keep that in mind. So where should we start with the financial projections?,2024-09-03 22:43:57
15868,deescalatory_conversation_563,speaker_1,"Let's start with the revenue assumptions. Once you get those, the rest will make more sense.",2024-09-03 22:45:57
15869,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up to the group study session last night?,2024-09-03 21:53:01
15870,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,"I had something come up at the last minute, but I was planning to review the materials on my own.",2024-09-03 21:54:01
15871,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,But you didn't tell us anything. We were waiting and didn't know what to do.,2024-09-03 22:01:01
15872,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,I apologize for that. I should have sent a message letting you know. Can we figure out a way to make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 22:03:01
15873,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,"Yeah, that would've helped. Maybe we can create a group chat for better communication?",2024-09-03 22:09:01
15874,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,That’s a good idea. I think that would help keep everyone in the loop.,2024-09-03 22:18:01
15875,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,"Great. Also, since you missed the session, do you need any notes or help with any particular topic?",2024-09-03 22:20:01
15876,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,"Yes, if it's not too much trouble. I struggled with the problem set on linear algebra. Can you explain it to me?",2024-09-03 22:22:01
15877,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,"Sure, I can walk you through it after class today. Let's meet in the library?",2024-09-03 22:28:01
15878,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_2,That sounds perfect. Thanks for being understanding.,2024-09-03 22:35:01
15879,deescalatory_conversation_564,speaker_1,No problem. We all have things come up sometimes. Let’s just make sure we’re better coordinated next time.,2024-09-03 22:44:01
15880,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for the team project meeting yesterday?,2024-09-03 21:53:03
15881,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,I got caught up with something at home and couldn't make it.,2024-09-03 21:55:03
15882,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,You could have at least sent a message. We waited for an hour.,2024-09-03 22:01:03
15883,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm really sorry. I should have communicated better.",2024-09-03 22:08:03
15884,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,"It's just frustrating because this project is really important, and we need everyone to be on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:15:03
15885,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,I understand. How can I make it up to the team?,2024-09-03 22:19:03
15886,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,We need to finalize the presentation slides. Can you handle that?,2024-09-03 22:24:03
15887,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll start on them tonight and make sure they're ready by tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:34:03
15888,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_1,Thanks. Let's just make sure we keep each other in the loop from now on.,2024-09-03 22:42:03
15889,deescalatory_conversation_565,speaker_2,Agreed. Communication is key. I'll be more proactive.,2024-09-03 22:51:03
15890,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,"Why didn't you tell me about the changes to the project deadline, Mark?",2024-09-03 21:49:06
15891,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"I thought you already knew, Jen. It was on the shared calendar.",2024-09-03 21:50:06
15892,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,"I check the calendar daily, and I didn't see anything about an earlier deadline.",2024-09-03 21:52:06
15893,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"Maybe you overlooked it. But look, we need to focus on how we're going to meet the deadline now.",2024-09-03 21:53:06
15894,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,Our work plans are based on the old deadline. We need a concrete plan to catch up.,2024-09-03 21:56:06
15895,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,You're right. Let's prioritize the key tasks that need to be completed first. Do you have an updated list?,2024-09-03 22:02:06
15896,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,"Yes, I do. I'll share it with you right after this.",2024-09-03 22:03:06
15897,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,Great. Maybe we can delegate some of the smaller tasks to the rest of the team too.,2024-09-03 22:12:06
15898,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,That sounds like a solid approach. We should also schedule a meeting to make sure everyone's on the same page.,2024-09-03 22:15:06
15899,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,Agreed. How about we meet with the team tomorrow morning?,2024-09-03 22:16:06
15900,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_1,"Perfect. I'll send out an invite to everyone. Thanks for helping to sort this out, Mark.",2024-09-03 22:26:06
15901,deescalatory_conversation_566,speaker_2,"No problem, Jen. We'll get through this together.",2024-09-03 22:27:06
15902,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,Why did you change the itinerary without discussing it with the rest of us?,2024-09-03 21:45:11
15903,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,I had to make a quick decision because we were running out of time.,2024-09-03 21:52:11
15904,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,But not consulting us made the entire group's plans fall apart!,2024-09-03 21:53:11
15905,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_3,I didn't even know about the change until we were already at the new location.,2024-09-03 22:00:11
15906,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,I'm really sorry. I thought it was the best option at the moment.,2024-09-03 22:08:11
15907,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_3,Could we at least talk about these decisions next time? It would help everyone stay informed.,2024-09-03 22:14:11
15908,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,"Yeah, I think better communication would prevent misunderstandings like this.",2024-09-03 22:24:11
15909,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,"You're right. I should have found a way to consult everyone, even if it was a quick decision.",2024-09-03 22:25:11
15910,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_3,"Maybe we can set up a system for emergency decisions in the future, so no one feels left out.",2024-09-03 22:27:11
15911,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,That sounds like a good plan. And it will help us trust each other more.,2024-09-03 22:33:11
15912,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,"I'll take responsibility for this, and I'll make sure to communicate better going forward.",2024-09-03 22:39:11
15913,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_3,Thanks for understanding. Let’s figure out how to get back on track from here.,2024-09-03 22:44:11
15914,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's make sure we all know what the next steps are.,2024-09-03 22:49:11
15915,deescalatory_conversation_567,speaker_1,"Okay, let’s outline our plan and stick to it, together this time.",2024-09-03 22:50:11
15916,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,"Why did you change the project timeline without telling anyone, Alex?",2024-09-03 21:45:14
15917,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,"I didn't have a choice, Sarah. We were falling behind schedule, and I thought speeding things up would help.",2024-09-03 21:49:14
15918,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,But you didn't consult the team. Now we're all scrambling to catch up.,2024-09-03 21:54:14
15919,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_3,"Guys, I think we need to focus on how to fix this instead of arguing. How can we get back on track?",2024-09-03 22:04:14
15920,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,"You're right, Mark. Maybe we can redistribute some of the tasks to balance the workload better. Any ideas on which tasks could be shifted?",2024-09-03 22:06:14
15921,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,"I can take on some of the data analysis since I finished my part of the research early. What about you, Mark?",2024-09-03 22:09:14
15922,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_3,"I can handle the client meetings if Alex focuses on drafting the new report sections. Does that work for you, Alex?",2024-09-03 22:17:14
15923,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_2,"Yeah, that works. Thanks for pitching in, guys. I realize now that I should've communicated better.",2024-09-03 22:18:14
15924,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_1,"Let's just make sure we keep everyone in the loop from now on. We're a team, and we need to operate like one.",2024-09-03 22:21:14
15925,deescalatory_conversation_568,speaker_3,Agreed. We'll get through this together. Let's coordinate our tasks and get back on track.,2024-09-03 22:29:14
15926,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass me the ball when I was open, Jordan?",2024-09-03 21:45:18
15927,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,"Because you never pass it to me when I'm open, Sam.",2024-09-03 21:52:18
15928,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,"That's not true. I do pass to you, but you missed the last few shots.",2024-09-03 21:54:18
15929,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,"Well, I feel like you don't trust me since those misses.",2024-09-03 21:58:18
15930,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_3,"Guys, let's take a step back. Our communication is breaking down, and it's affecting our game.",2024-09-03 22:01:18
15931,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,"Maybe, but it's frustrating when we're trying to win, and things like this happen.",2024-09-03 22:04:18
15932,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,"I get that it's frustrating, Sam. Can we figure out how to trust each other more on the court?",2024-09-03 22:07:18
15933,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_3,How about we come up with a plan to make sure everyone gets a fair chance to contribute?,2024-09-03 22:08:18
15934,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,"I can agree to that. Maybe during practice, we can try some drills focused on team play and passing.",2024-09-03 22:17:18
15935,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,"That sounds good. And I'll make an effort to improve my shooting so that when I do get the pass, I'll make it count.",2024-09-03 22:24:18
15936,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_3,Perfect. It sounds like we're all on the same page now. Let's give it our best at the next practice and see how we improve from there.,2024-09-03 22:25:18
15937,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's work on this together and build the trust we need to win.,2024-09-03 22:28:18
15938,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for talking this out, both of you.",2024-09-03 22:37:18
15939,deescalatory_conversation_569,speaker_3,,2024-09-03 22:40:18
15940,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"We've been stuck on this group project for hours, and nothing's getting done.",2024-09-03 21:49:21
15941,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"Well, maybe if you actually listened to my ideas, we'd make some progress.",2024-09-03 21:50:21
15942,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing isn't helping. We need to find a way to work together.",2024-09-03 21:54:21
15943,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"I'm just frustrated because we agreed on a different direction, but it feels like we're going in circles.",2024-09-03 22:04:21
15944,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"Alright, let's take a step back. Can we go over the main points we need to cover again?",2024-09-03 22:06:21
15945,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_3,"Good idea. We need to address the research data, the analysis, and then our conclusions. Where are we stuck?",2024-09-03 22:08:21
15946,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"I think it's the analysis part. We have tons of data, but interpreting it has been confusing.",2024-09-03 22:13:21
15947,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,"I see your point. Maybe we should divide the data into smaller sections and each take a part to analyze, then share our findings.",2024-09-03 22:19:21
15948,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_3,That sounds manageable. Which sections should we divide and take?,2024-09-03 22:22:21
15949,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"How about I take the first quarter, you, speaker_2, take the second, and speaker_3 takes the third? We can reconvene afterward to discuss.",2024-09-03 22:29:21
15950,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_2,That works for me. How much time should we spend on this before meeting back?,2024-09-03 22:32:21
15951,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_3,Let's give it an hour and then regroup. Does that sound good to everyone?,2024-09-03 22:40:21
15952,deescalatory_conversation_570,speaker_1,"Yeah, an hour sounds good. Let's",2024-09-03 22:42:21
15953,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't pass me the ball during the game, Josh. We could've won!",2024-09-03 21:44:25
15954,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"Really, Emily? You think that's why we lost? Maybe if you weren't hogging the ball earlier, I would've passed it.",2024-09-03 21:47:25
15955,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,I was not hogging the ball! I was just trying to play my best. You should've trusted me.,2024-09-03 21:56:25
15956,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"Trusted you? Every time you got the ball, you went for a shot without looking for better options.",2024-09-03 22:04:25
15957,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,"Look, Josh, I'm sorry if it seemed that way. I was just really trying to score.",2024-09-03 22:05:25
15958,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"And I get that, but this is a team sport. We need to communicate better.",2024-09-03 22:07:25
15959,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,You're right. We should've talked more during the game. I should've looked for you more often.,2024-09-03 22:09:25
15960,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,"And I should've given you a heads-up when I was open. Next game, let's try to coordinate better.",2024-09-03 22:16:25
15961,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_1,Agreed. How about we practice some passing drills before the next game?,2024-09-03 22:22:25
15962,deescalatory_conversation_571,speaker_2,That’s a good idea. It'll help us get more in sync.,2024-09-03 22:32:25
15963,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and approved that project without consulting me.,2024-09-03 21:50:27
15964,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,I thought it was urgent and didn't want to lose the opportunity. I didn’t mean to exclude you.,2024-09-03 21:55:27
15965,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,But you know how important collaboration is to me. We've always made decisions together.,2024-09-03 22:03:27
15966,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,You're right. I should have included you in the decision. Can we look at it together now and address any concerns you might have?,2024-09-03 22:10:27
15967,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,"I'd appreciate that. I just felt overlooked, and it bothered me.",2024-09-03 22:15:27
15968,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,I understand. It wasn’t my intention to make you feel that way. Let’s make sure we communicate better in the future.,2024-09-03 22:18:27
15969,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,Agreed. And I’ll make an effort to not jump to conclusions next time.,2024-09-03 22:27:27
15970,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,Thanks for being open to discussing this. I really value our partnership.,2024-09-03 22:28:27
15971,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_1,Me too. Let’s get back on track with this project and move forward together.,2024-09-03 22:31:27
15972,deescalatory_conversation_572,speaker_2,Absolutely. I think our teamwork makes a big difference.,2024-09-03 22:39:27
15973,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,"Why didn't you pass the ball, Jeremy? We could have scored!",2024-09-03 21:52:31
15974,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,"Alex, I didn't see you were open. By the time I realized, it was too late.",2024-09-03 21:54:31
15975,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,But I've told you before to always keep an eye out for open teammates.,2024-09-03 22:02:31
15976,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm trying to improve. It happens so fast out there.",2024-09-03 22:06:31
15977,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing isn't helping. We need to figure out how to communicate better on the field.",2024-09-03 22:15:31
15978,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,"You're right, Christine. I'm just frustrated because we're losing.",2024-09-03 22:20:31
15979,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,I get that. How about we practice some drills after practice to improve our passing?,2024-09-03 22:24:31
15980,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_3,That sounds like a good plan. We can even work on some signals to alert each other when we're open.,2024-09-03 22:32:31
15981,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,"Okay, let's do it. I just want us to play better as a team.",2024-09-03 22:42:31
15982,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_2,Me too. Sorry for missing that pass. I'll pay more attention next time.,2024-09-03 22:43:31
15983,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_3,Great. Let's focus on our teamwork and improve together.,2024-09-03 22:48:31
15984,deescalatory_conversation_573,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's turn this around in the next game.,2024-09-03 22:52:31
15985,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,I can't believe you went behind my back and changed the designs for the project without even telling me.,2024-09-03 21:52:35
15986,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,I didn't think you'd mind. I thought it would improve our chances of winning the competition.,2024-09-03 21:59:35
15987,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,But we agreed on the original designs together! It feels like you don't trust my input.,2024-09-03 22:01:35
15988,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,"I do trust your input, but we were running out of time, and I thought a fresh perspective could make a difference.",2024-09-03 22:06:35
15989,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,"You should have at least discussed it with me first. It's a team project, after all.",2024-09-03 22:15:35
15990,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated with you before making any changes. I'm sorry for that.,2024-09-03 22:16:35
15991,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,I appreciate that. But now we're in a tough spot. The final submission is tomorrow.,2024-09-03 22:22:35
15992,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,Let's go through the new designs together and incorporate your feedback. We can still make this work.,2024-09-03 22:26:35
15993,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,"Alright, but we need to work quickly. Can you explain the changes you made?",2024-09-03 22:32:35
15994,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,Of course. I added more interactive elements to the interface to make it more user-friendly.,2024-09-03 22:39:35
15995,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we can keep those elements but tweak the layout to align with our original vision.,2024-09-03 22:49:35
15996,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_2,I like that approach. Let's start with the homepage and work our way through the rest.,2024-09-03 22:59:35
15997,deescalatory_conversation_574,speaker_1,"Great, and let's make sure we keep communicating. We both want this",2024-09-03 23:09:35
15998,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,"Jenna, why didn't you tell me that you changed the pitch presentation last minute?",2024-09-03 21:46:39
15999,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,"Mark, I thought my changes would improve it. There wasn't time to get everyone's input.",2024-09-03 21:48:39
16000,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,But we agreed to discuss any major changes as a team. This isn't just your project.,2024-09-03 21:49:39
16001,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,"I get that, but the client was expecting something stronger. I was just trying to help.",2024-09-03 21:54:39
16002,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,"I understand your intentions, but trust and communication are key. Can we at least agree to inform each other next time?",2024-09-03 22:00:39
16003,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,Fair enough. Let’s set a quick meeting before submitting any changes in the future.,2024-09-03 22:05:39
16004,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,Sounds good. And maybe we can both present to the client next time to ensure we’re on the same page. How about that?,2024-09-03 22:11:39
16005,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_2,Deal. I think that will go a long way in avoiding confusion.,2024-09-03 22:20:39
16006,deescalatory_conversation_575,speaker_1,Great. Let's move forward together. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:22:39
16007,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,Why did you change the playlist without asking me first?,2024-09-03 21:47:42
16008,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,I just thought the new songs would pump everyone up more.,2024-09-03 21:53:42
16009,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,But we had agreed on the playlist as a team. It’s not fair to change it last minute.,2024-09-03 21:55:42
16010,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,"I understand, but the old playlist wasn’t getting the reaction we hoped for.",2024-09-03 21:59:42
16011,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,"Next time, can we at least discuss it together before making decisions?",2024-09-03 22:05:42
16012,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,"Sure, I’ll make sure to ask everyone next time. I didn’t realize it would be a big deal.",2024-09-03 22:14:42
16013,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,"Thanks, I appreciate it. We all need to feel included in these choices.",2024-09-03 22:21:42
16014,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,You're right. Do you think we can find a way to combine both playlists for the next game?,2024-09-03 22:23:42
16015,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_1,That sounds like a good compromise. Let’s try that and see how the team reacts.,2024-09-03 22:30:42
16016,deescalatory_conversation_576,speaker_2,"Great, let's do it together.",2024-09-03 22:33:42
16017,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"David, did you take my calculus notebook? I can’t find it anywhere.",2024-09-03 21:49:46
16018,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,"No, Emily, I didn’t take your notebook. Why would I?",2024-09-03 21:54:46
16019,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"Well, it's missing and you needed help with the homework. It’s just weird that it disappeared.",2024-09-03 21:55:46
16020,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,"I understand how it looks, but I swear I didn't take it. Have you checked the study room?",2024-09-03 22:05:46
16021,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"Yes, I already did! It’s just frustrating because my notes are in there and our test is next week.",2024-09-03 22:12:46
16022,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,"Have you asked Sara if she might have borrowed it? She shares the study room with you, right?",2024-09-03 22:19:46
16023,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"No, I haven’t asked her. I didn't think of that. I'll check with her, but I still feel like you might know more than you're saying.",2024-09-03 22:23:46
16024,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,"Look, Emily, I can see you're really stressed about this. How about we retrace your steps from the last time you saw the notebook?",2024-09-03 22:32:46
16025,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"Alright, I had it with me in the library yesterday afternoon. After that, I went straight to the study room.",2024-09-03 22:36:46
16026,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,"And you didn’t stop anywhere else, like the cafeteria?",2024-09-03 22:38:46
16027,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_1,"Wait, I did go to the cafeteria for a quick snack. Maybe I left it there.",2024-09-03 22:45:46
16028,deescalatory_conversation_577,speaker_2,That could be it. Let's go check the lost and found there. If it’s not there,2024-09-03 22:49:46
16029,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,"I can't believe you ruined the book report, Jenna! We had two weeks to work on it, and you didn’t finish your part.",2024-09-03 21:45:50
16030,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,"Sarah, calm down. I had a lot of other assignments to complete. I was planning to finish it last night but got overwhelmed.",2024-09-03 21:50:50
16031,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,You should’ve told me earlier if you were struggling. We could have worked on it together.,2024-09-03 21:58:50
16032,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have communicated better. I'm sorry. How can we fix this now?",2024-09-03 22:05:50
16033,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,We can still salvage it if we divide the remaining work tonight and focus on finishing strong.,2024-09-03 22:09:50
16034,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,Agreed. Let’s list out what’s left to do and split it evenly.,2024-09-03 22:11:50
16035,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,"Okay, I’ll handle the introduction and the first two chapters’ summary. You can complete the analysis and conclusion.",2024-09-03 22:17:50
16036,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,Sounds fair. I’ll start on the analysis right after dinner and send you my draft.,2024-09-03 22:23:50
16037,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,Great. Let’s also review each other’s sections to make sure the report is cohesive.,2024-09-03 22:29:50
16038,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_2,Absolutely. We can do this if we work together. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:38:50
16039,deescalatory_conversation_578,speaker_1,No problem. Let's give it our best shot and make this report great.,2024-09-03 22:48:50
16040,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,We need to talk about the group project. Why did you tell Professor Lewis that I wasn't contributing?,2024-09-03 21:50:54
16041,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,"Because it felt like you weren't. The deadlines were getting closer, and I hadn't seen your part.",2024-09-03 21:57:54
16042,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,"I was working on it, trust me. Just because I didn't send updates doesn't mean I wasn't doing anything.",2024-09-03 22:07:54
16043,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,"I get that, but without updates, I thought you left everything to us. Communication is crucial in a group project.",2024-09-03 22:09:54
16044,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,"I understand, but you could've asked me first before going to the professor. It felt like a betrayal.",2024-09-03 22:15:54
16045,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have talked to you directly. But I was stressed and worried about the project's completion.",2024-09-03 22:19:54
16046,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, but next time, let's try to sort things out between ourselves before involving others. Working together means trusting each other.",2024-09-03 22:21:54
16047,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,"Agreed. From now on, I'll check in with you if I feel concerned. Can we move past this now?",2024-09-03 22:31:54
16048,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_1,"Yes, we can. I'll make sure to give regular updates so we're all on the same page. Let's finish this project strong.",2024-09-03 22:41:54
16049,deescalatory_conversation_579,speaker_2,Sounds like a plan. Thanks for understanding. Let's get back to work and make this project great.,2024-09-03 22:49:54
16050,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,"Hey, why didn't you join the group meeting yesterday? We needed your input for the project.",2024-09-03 21:49:58
16051,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,"I had something come up at work, and I completely forgot. I’m really sorry about that.",2024-09-03 21:57:58
16052,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,"Look, I get that you're busy, but we've got deadlines to meet. This isn't just about you.",2024-09-03 22:05:58
16053,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,I understand. Can you catch me up on what I missed? Maybe I can help make up for it.,2024-09-03 22:15:58
16054,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,We finalized most of the design but we're still unsure about the user interface. We needed your expertise.,2024-09-03 22:18:58
16055,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,I can devote a couple of hours tonight to work on the UI. Would that help?,2024-09-03 22:19:58
16056,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,That would definitely help. Can you also check the color scheme? It’s been giving us trouble.,2024-09-03 22:20:58
16057,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,"Sure, I can do that. It’s my responsibility too. Let's plan to review it together tomorrow.",2024-09-03 22:30:58
16058,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,That sounds good. Let’s make sure we communicate better going forward. We can’t afford to miss meetings.,2024-09-03 22:37:58
16059,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,Agreed. I’ll set reminders and be more proactive in keeping up with the group. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:43:58
16060,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_1,"Alright, let's get this project back on track. We all want to see it succeed.",2024-09-03 22:49:58
16061,deescalatory_conversation_580,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll get started right away.,2024-09-03 22:50:58
16062,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,You didn't show up for the group project meeting yesterday. What happened?,2024-09-03 21:45:02
16063,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"I had a family emergency, but I messaged you all in the group chat. Didn't you see it?",2024-09-03 21:49:02
16064,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,"No, I didn't see it. We were really counting on you to present your part.",2024-09-03 21:55:02
16065,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, but it was unavoidable. Can we figure out the next steps together now?",2024-09-03 21:58:02
16066,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,"Yeah, we need to agree on who will take on which sections. Your part is crucial.",2024-09-03 22:07:02
16067,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"Absolutely, I'll make sure to catch up and contribute fully. Can you bring me up to speed?",2024-09-03 22:14:02
16068,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,"Sure, we decided to split the project into three sections. You were working on the first part, right?",2024-09-03 22:21:02
16069,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,"Yes, I was. Okay, so what's the new timeline for completing this?",2024-09-03 22:26:02
16070,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,We need to have a draft ready by Friday. Do you think you'll be able to handle that?,2024-09-03 22:28:02
16071,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,I can handle it. I'll work on my part tonight and update everyone by tomorrow afternoon.,2024-09-03 22:32:02
16072,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,"Great, that sounds like a plan. Let's keep communicating better, so this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:33:02
16073,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll be more proactive about updates. Thanks for understanding.,2024-09-03 22:43:02
16074,deescalatory_conversation_581,speaker_1,No problem. Let's just get this done together.,2024-09-03 22:44:02
16075,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,Why did you make the decision without consulting us first?,2024-09-03 21:49:06
16076,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,I thought it would be the best way to move forward quickly.,2024-09-03 21:53:06
16077,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,But this affects the whole team. We should have been involved.,2024-09-03 22:03:06
16078,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,I see your point. I should have asked for everyone's input.,2024-09-03 22:12:06
16079,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,It's not just about asking us. We need to trust each other.,2024-09-03 22:17:06
16080,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,You're right. I didn't consider the impact it would have on our trust.,2024-09-03 22:25:06
16081,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?,2024-09-03 22:29:06
16082,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,Maybe we could establish a rule to discuss major decisions in our weekly meetings.,2024-09-03 22:35:06
16083,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,That sounds reasonable. I'd be on board with that.,2024-09-03 22:43:06
16084,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,And let's also make sure we encourage each other to speak up if we have concerns.,2024-09-03 22:48:06
16085,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,Agreed. It's important everyone feels heard.,2024-09-03 22:55:06
16086,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,I appreciate you both bringing this up. I'll work on being more inclusive in future decisions.,2024-09-03 23:01:06
16087,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,Thanks for understanding. Let's focus on moving forward together.,2024-09-03 23:09:06
16088,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_1,"Yes, let's get back to working as a team.",2024-09-03 23:19:06
16089,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Together, we can achieve our goals more effectively.",2024-09-03 23:20:06
16090,deescalatory_conversation_582,speaker_3,"Great. Now, let's tackle the next steps and make sure we're all on the same page.",2024-09-03 23:28:06
16091,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,Why did you take the last slice of cake without asking me?,2024-09-03 21:50:08
16092,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,I didn't know I needed to ask every time I wanted some cake.,2024-09-03 21:51:08
16093,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,We've always shared things equally. You know this isn't fair.,2024-09-03 21:54:08
16094,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,"I understand, but I was really craving something sweet. Next time I'll ask, I promise.",2024-09-03 21:56:08
16095,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,It’s not just about the cake. It’s about respecting each other’s stuff.,2024-09-03 22:02:08
16096,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,You're right. I didn’t think it would upset you this much.,2024-09-03 22:12:08
16097,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,Thank you for understanding. Maybe we can just agree to check with each other next time.,2024-09-03 22:19:08
16098,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_2,Agreed. Let's make sure to do that. Do you want to bake another cake together this weekend?,2024-09-03 22:26:08
16099,deescalatory_conversation_583,speaker_1,That sounds like a great idea. Baking together will be fun.,2024-09-03 22:36:08
16100,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"Why did you take my designs without asking, Sarah?",2024-09-03 21:52:12
16101,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"I didn't take your designs, Mike. I thought they were part of the team's shared resources.",2024-09-03 21:53:12
16102,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"We've always had individual projects, and you know that.",2024-09-03 22:02:12
16103,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"Okay, I see where you're coming from now. But can we talk about this calmly?",2024-09-03 22:12:12
16104,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"Sure, but it bothers me that it wasn't communicated, Sarah.",2024-09-03 22:20:12
16105,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"I understand, Mike. I should have asked first. Can we find a way to make sure this doesn't happen again?",2024-09-03 22:24:12
16106,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,Let's set clearer boundaries on what's shared and what's individual.,2024-09-03 22:27:12
16107,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,Good idea. Maybe a simple label system on our folders can help.,2024-09-03 22:33:12
16108,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"That could definitely work. And if we have any doubts, we ask first.",2024-09-03 22:39:12
16109,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,"Agreed. I’m sorry for the misunderstanding, Mike.",2024-09-03 22:49:12
16110,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"Thanks, Sarah. Let’s move forward and make this project a success.",2024-09-03 22:58:12
16111,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,Absolutely. We make a great team when we communicate well.,2024-09-03 23:01:12
16112,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_1,"Definitely. Let's get back to work, then.",2024-09-03 23:02:12
16113,deescalatory_conversation_584,speaker_2,Sounds good!,2024-09-03 23:08:12
16114,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"Amy, I don't understand why you didn't tell me about the project changes earlier.",2024-09-03 21:45:16
16115,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"Sarah, I didn't think it was a big deal at the time.",2024-09-03 21:47:16
16116,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,Not a big deal? The whole project could be compromised because of this.,2024-09-03 21:55:16
16117,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"Look, I get that you're upset. I didn't intend for things to get this messed up.",2024-09-03 22:05:16
16118,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_3,"Guys, maybe we can figure this out together. What exactly changed in the project?",2024-09-03 22:13:16
16119,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"The client revised the specifications two days ago, but Amy didn't update our documents.",2024-09-03 22:22:16
16120,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,I just didn't think it would affect our timeline that much. I was wrong.,2024-09-03 22:23:16
16121,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"Well, now we're behind. How are we supposed to meet the deadline?",2024-09-03 22:31:16
16122,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_3,Why don't we take a step back and re-evaluate the timeline with these new specifications?,2024-09-03 22:34:16
16123,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,That sounds reasonable. We could redistribute some of the workload to catch up.,2024-09-03 22:39:16
16124,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"Okay, but we need more communication from now on. No more surprises.",2024-09-03 22:45:16
16125,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to keep everyone updated from now on.,2024-09-03 22:53:16
16126,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_3,Perfect. So let's start by listing all the new specifications and adjusting our tasks accordingly.,2024-09-03 22:55:16
16127,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_1,"Alright, I'll handle the client communication from now on to ensure we get real-time updates.",2024-09-03 23:01:16
16128,deescalatory_conversation_585,speaker_2,"Thanks, Sarah. I’ll get started on updating the documents right away",2024-09-03 23:09:16
16129,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,"Why did you delete my part of the project, Mia?",2024-09-03 21:50:19
16130,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"Because it didn't match the style guide we agreed on, Sam.",2024-09-03 21:57:19
16131,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,But you could have told me instead of just erasing it!,2024-09-03 22:02:19
16132,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"True, I should have communicated better. I'm sorry for that. Can we work on fixing it together?",2024-09-03 22:09:19
16133,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,"Yes, but it feels like I'm always the one compromising.",2024-09-03 22:15:19
16134,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,I understand how you feel. Let's make sure we both get a say this time.,2024-09-03 22:23:19
16135,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,"Okay, let's go over the guidelines again to make sure we're on the same page.",2024-09-03 22:32:19
16136,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,That sounds good. We can also set regular check-ins to discuss any changes before making them.,2024-09-03 22:42:19
16137,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,I like that idea. It will help prevent misunderstandings.,2024-09-03 22:47:19
16138,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"Great. Your input is valuable, and I want to make sure it shines through in our project.",2024-09-03 22:55:19
16139,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_1,"Thank you, Mia. I appreciate that.",2024-09-03 23:03:19
16140,deescalatory_conversation_586,speaker_2,"You're welcome, Sam. Let's make this the best project we can.",2024-09-03 23:10:19
16141,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,I can't believe you submitted the group project without consulting any of us first.,2024-09-03 21:47:22
16142,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,"I had to, we were running out of time and no one else was taking charge.",2024-09-03 21:48:22
16143,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,But we agreed to review it together before submitting! Now there are mistakes.,2024-09-03 21:53:22
16144,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,"I understand you're upset, but I thought it was better than missing the deadline.",2024-09-03 22:00:22
16145,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,Why didn't you at least send us a message to let us know you were doing it?,2024-09-03 22:06:22
16146,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,"You're right, I should have done that. I was just really stressed and panicked.",2024-09-03 22:14:22
16147,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,"Stress is one thing, making decisions for the whole group is another.",2024-09-03 22:22:22
16148,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,I apologize. How can we fix the mistakes now?,2024-09-03 22:30:22
16149,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,Maybe we can email the professor and explain the situation.,2024-09-03 22:35:22
16150,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,And ask if we can submit a revision.,2024-09-03 22:43:22
16151,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. I'll even write the email if you want.,2024-09-03 22:48:22
16152,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,"Okay, let's work on the corrections together first.",2024-09-03 22:53:22
16153,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_1,Agreed. Let's make sure this doesn't happen again by setting up more regular check-ins.,2024-09-03 23:03:22
16154,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_2,That sounds fair. Thanks for being willing to work through this together.,2024-09-03 23:12:22
16155,deescalatory_conversation_587,speaker_3,No problem. Let's get started on fixing those errors now.,2024-09-03 23:14:22
16156,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"I can't believe you just ditched us during the presentation, Laura!",2024-09-03 21:49:26
16157,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,"I didn't ditch you guys, Mark. I had an emergency. I texted Alex.",2024-09-03 21:53:26
16158,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_3,"Yeah, Laura texted me. But still, the project was important. We were depending on you to present the financials.",2024-09-03 21:54:26
16159,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"Exactly! And when you weren’t there, we all looked bad in front of the client.",2024-09-03 22:01:26
16160,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,"I'm really sorry, but my sister was in an accident. I had to rush to the hospital. Wouldn't you do the same?",2024-09-03 22:02:26
16161,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"Okay, I guess I didn't know it was that serious. But you could have at least called, not just texted.",2024-09-03 22:12:26
16162,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_3,Maybe we should focus on how to inform everyone quicker if emergencies happen again.,2024-09-03 22:14:26
16163,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,"Sure, I can agree to that. What if we set up a call chain so everyone gets the message immediately?",2024-09-03 22:17:26
16164,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"That’s a good idea. We could split responsibilities in a way that if someone drops out last minute, it's not too disastrous.",2024-09-03 22:21:26
16165,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_3,"Yeah, maybe cross-train each other on different parts of the presentation, just in case?",2024-09-03 22:29:26
16166,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_2,I’m up for that. I really didn't mean to let you guys down. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:37:26
16167,deescalatory_conversation_588,speaker_1,"Alright, Laura. I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions. Let's just work on",2024-09-03 22:45:26
16168,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,"I can’t believe you went ahead and made changes to the project without consulting us first, Sam.",2024-09-03 21:49:30
16169,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,"Look, I thought it would improve our presentation, but I see now I should’ve asked you guys first.",2024-09-03 21:58:30
16170,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_3,"Sam, it’s not just that you changed things. It’s that we’ve been working on this together for weeks, and now we have to adjust our parts last minute.",2024-09-03 22:03:30
16171,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,I understand. That wasn’t fair to you. How can we fix this now?,2024-09-03 22:05:30
16172,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,Let’s take another look at the changes. Maybe we can incorporate some of your ideas without completely redoing our work.,2024-09-03 22:15:30
16173,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_3,"Yeah, maybe we can blend both versions. Sam’s additions might actually enhance our project if we integrate them properly.",2024-09-03 22:18:30
16174,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,I’d be happy to explain what I changed and why. Then we can decide together what to keep.,2024-09-03 22:21:30
16175,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_1,That sounds good. We all need to be on the same page. Let’s set aside some time to go through everything and make sure we’re all comfortable with the final version.,2024-09-03 22:28:30
16176,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_3,"Agreed. Sam, thanks for being open to discussing this. Let’s schedule a meeting for tomorrow to finalize it all.",2024-09-03 22:36:30
16177,deescalatory_conversation_589,speaker_2,Sure thing. I appreciate you both being willing to work this out. Let’s make this project the best it can be.,2024-09-03 22:45:30
16178,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,I can't believe you changed the vacation plans without even consulting me!,2024-09-03 21:48:33
16179,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,"I had to, the original dates conflicted with my work schedule. I'm sorry if that upset you.",2024-09-03 21:54:33
16180,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,But I've already taken those days off from work. It's not easy to change my schedule last minute.,2024-09-03 21:59:33
16181,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,"I understand, but I tried to find dates that work for both of us. Let's see if we can talk to our managers and find a compromise.",2024-09-03 22:08:33
16182,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,It's just frustrating. I had everything planned around those dates.,2024-09-03 22:17:33
16183,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,I totally get it. How about we sit down and look at our schedules together? Maybe there's a way to make this work.,2024-09-03 22:20:33
16184,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,"Alright, let's do that. It's just important that we communicate about these things next time.",2024-09-03 22:28:33
16185,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to check with you before making any changes in the future.,2024-09-03 22:36:33
16186,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_1,Thanks for understanding. Let's hope we can find a solution that suits us both.,2024-09-03 22:38:33
16187,deescalatory_conversation_590,speaker_2,I'm sure we will. Let's start by opening our calendars.,2024-09-03 22:45:33
16188,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,"I can't believe you handed in the group project without consulting any of us, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:48:37
16189,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,I thought I was making a quick decision. The deadline was approaching fast.,2024-09-03 21:56:37
16190,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_3,But we had agreed to review everything together. This affects all of our grades.,2024-09-03 22:01:37
16191,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,I understand that. I'm sorry for not including everyone. What can we do to fix it now?,2024-09-03 22:07:37
16192,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,Maybe we could send an additional document with the changes we discussed last time?,2024-09-03 22:08:37
16193,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_3,That sounds reasonable. Do you think the professor will allow it?,2024-09-03 22:09:37
16194,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,I think it's worth a try. I'll draft an email explaining the situation and proposing our updates.,2024-09-03 22:16:37
16195,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,"Great, but let's make sure to review the draft together this time before sending it out.",2024-09-03 22:18:37
16196,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_3,Agreed. When can we all meet to go over the document?,2024-09-03 22:23:37
16197,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,How about tonight at 7 PM? I'll share the draft by 6 so you both have time to read it.,2024-09-03 22:26:37
16198,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_1,That works for me. We can use my notes from our last meeting to ensure all points are covered.,2024-09-03 22:35:37
16199,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_3,"Perfect. Thanks for understanding, Sarah. Let's get this sorted out and move forward.",2024-09-03 22:42:37
16200,deescalatory_conversation_591,speaker_2,"Absolutely. Thanks for your patience, guys. We'll make sure this doesn't happen again.",2024-09-03 22:51:37
16201,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,"I don't understand why you submitted the group project without consulting us first, Alex.",2024-09-03 21:51:40
16202,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"I had to, Mia. The deadline was closing, and no one else was available to review the final draft.",2024-09-03 22:00:40
16203,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_3,"Still, you should've waited, Alex. We all agreed to go over it together before submission.",2024-09-03 22:02:40
16204,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,"I know, but everyone seemed busy and unresponsive, and I panicked. Sorry if I overstepped.",2024-09-03 22:05:40
16205,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,We weren't unresponsive; we were just finalizing our sections. A quick message would have clarified things.,2024-09-03 22:12:40
16206,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,I see your point. Maybe I should have tried harder to communicate. Can we talk about the project now and figure out if there's a way we can fix any issues?,2024-09-03 22:13:40
16207,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_3,"Sure, let's see what we've got submitted. Maybe we can make minor edits if needed.",2024-09-03 22:16:40
16208,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_1,"I appreciate that, Alex. Next time, let's make sure we're all on the same page before taking big steps.",2024-09-03 22:18:40
16209,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_2,Absolutely. I learned my lesson. Let's review it together right now and make sure everything's in order.,2024-09-03 22:23:40
16210,deescalatory_conversation_592,speaker_3,Great idea. Let’s make the most of the time we still have.,2024-09-03 22:29:40
16211,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,"I can't believe you forgot your part of the group project again, Kyle.",2024-09-03 21:48:45
16212,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"I told you I had a lot going on this week, Sarah.",2024-09-03 21:51:45
16213,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,"But you agreed to handle the research section, remember?",2024-09-03 21:52:45
16214,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"Yeah, I remember, but I really had no time. Can't we just figure out a way to divide the work differently?",2024-09-03 21:53:45
16215,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,We're running out of time. The presentation is in two days!,2024-09-03 21:55:45
16216,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"I know, and I'm sorry. Let's just see what we can do. Can we redistribute the tasks?",2024-09-03 21:56:45
16217,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_3,"Guys, fighting won't help. Let’s see how much work is left and split it up based on who has time.",2024-09-03 22:02:45
16218,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,Fine. I just don't want to end up doing everything last minute again.,2024-09-03 22:08:45
16219,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"I understand that, Sarah. I definitely don’t want you to feel that way. Can we list down what's left?",2024-09-03 22:09:45
16220,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_3,"We need to finish the research summary, create the slides, and practice the presentation.",2024-09-03 22:14:45
16221,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,"Ok, I'll take the research summary. Kyle, do you think you can handle creating the slides?",2024-09-03 22:24:45
16222,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,"Yes, I can definitely manage the slides.",2024-09-03 22:27:45
16223,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_3,And I can help with practicing the presentation. Is everyone okay with this plan?,2024-09-03 22:35:45
16224,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_1,This works for me. As long as everyone sticks to their part.,2024-09-03 22:37:45
16225,deescalatory_conversation_593,speaker_2,,2024-09-03 22:46:45
16226,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,"I can't believe you didn't call me to let me know about the meeting cancellation, Dave.",2024-09-03 21:48:48
16227,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,"I'm sorry, Jenny. I was swamped with work and completely forgot.",2024-09-03 21:51:48
16228,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,But you know how important that meeting was to me! I was there waiting for an hour.,2024-09-03 21:59:48
16229,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,"It really slipped my mind. I understand why you're upset, but can we find a way to communicate better in the future?",2024-09-03 22:05:48
16230,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,Maybe we should both set reminders or something. This can't happen again.,2024-09-03 22:13:48
16231,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,That sounds like a good plan. How about we both set Google Calendar alerts for important meetings?,2024-09-03 22:16:48
16232,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,"Alright, that could work. And maybe we can have a quick check-in the day before?",2024-09-03 22:26:48
16233,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,That's a great idea. A quick chat the day before to confirm everything sounds perfect.,2024-09-03 22:33:48
16234,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_1,"Thanks, Dave. Let’s try to make this work. I don’t want us to have misunderstandings like this again.",2024-09-03 22:40:48
16235,deescalatory_conversation_594,speaker_2,"Absolutely, Jenny. We got this.",2024-09-03 22:45:48
16236,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,Why didn't you come to practice yesterday? We needed you.,2024-09-03 21:45:51
16237,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,"I had too much homework, and I couldn't get it all done in time.",2024-09-03 21:46:51
16238,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,You could've at least let us know. We were all counting on you.,2024-09-03 21:52:51
16239,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,I'm sorry. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal for one day.,2024-09-03 21:57:51
16240,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,It was a big deal because we're a team. Everyone needs to show up.,2024-09-03 22:03:51
16241,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,"I get that, but sometimes school has to come first. I didn't have a choice.",2024-09-03 22:07:51
16242,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,"I understand school is important, but if we don't practice together, we won't improve as a team.",2024-09-03 22:15:51
16243,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,You're right. I should have communicated better. I'll do that next time.,2024-09-03 22:16:51
16244,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,Thanks. We just need to know what's going on. We're all in this together.,2024-09-03 22:17:51
16245,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,Agreed. I'll make sure to balance things better and keep you updated.,2024-09-03 22:18:51
16246,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_1,Let's move forward and focus on the upcoming game. We need to stick together.,2024-09-03 22:23:51
16247,deescalatory_conversation_595,speaker_2,Absolutely. Let's win this next one as a united team.,2024-09-03 22:30:51
16248,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,"Why did you skip band practice again, Alex? We needed you there.",2024-09-03 21:51:55
16249,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"I had some stuff come up, Sarah. It's not a big deal.",2024-09-03 22:01:55
16250,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,Not a big deal? We have a performance next week. You can't just skip practice.,2024-09-03 22:11:55
16251,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"I know, I know. But I've got so much on my plate right now.",2024-09-03 22:21:55
16252,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,"We all have busy schedules, but we're still showing up. You made a commitment.",2024-09-03 22:22:55
16253,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"Look, I'm trying my best. You don't understand how much I'm dealing with.",2024-09-03 22:32:55
16254,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,Then talk to us. Maybe we can help you out. But avoiding practice isn't helping anyone.,2024-09-03 22:41:55
16255,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,I didn't think anyone would understand. It's not just about band; it's everything.,2024-09-03 22:46:55
16256,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,Help us understand. What's going on?,2024-09-03 22:48:55
16257,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"I've been struggling with my classes, and my parents are on my case. I thought skipping practice would give me some time to catch up.",2024-09-03 22:58:55
16258,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,"Oh, I didn't realize it was that bad. We can work around your schedule. Let's find a way for you to manage both.",2024-09-03 23:07:55
16259,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,You'd really do that?,2024-09-03 23:09:55
16260,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,Of course. We're a team. Let's come up with a plan that works for you.,2024-09-03 23:19:55
16261,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_2,"Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate it. I'll do whatever it takes to get back on track.",2024-09-03 23:20:55
16262,deescalatory_conversation_596,speaker_1,Great,2024-09-03 23:29:55
16263,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,Did you take the last slice of pizza without asking anyone?,2024-09-03 21:53:57
16264,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,"Yeah, I did. But I was really hungry after practice.",2024-09-03 22:02:57
16265,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,Everyone was hungry after practice. You should have considered that.,2024-09-03 22:03:57
16266,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,"I know, but I didn't think it was that big of a deal.",2024-09-03 22:05:57
16267,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,It's not just about the pizza. It's about being considerate to the rest of us.,2024-09-03 22:10:57
16268,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,I get that now. I didn't mean to upset anyone.,2024-09-03 22:13:57

16270,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_2,You're right. I'll make sure to ask next time. Sorry about that.,2024-09-03 22:23:57
16271,deescalatory_conversation_597,speaker_1,Thanks. Apology accepted. Let's just move on and be more mindful.,2024-09-03 22:24:57
16272,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,Why didn't you pass me the ball when I was open?,2024-09-03 21:53:00
16273,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,Because you were too far out to make the shot!,2024-09-03 21:58:00
16274,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,Says who? I've made shots from that distance before.,2024-09-03 22:00:00
16275,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,"Sure, in practice, but this was a real game and we were under pressure!",2024-09-03 22:06:00
16276,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_3,"Guys, arguing isn't helping. We're all on the same team here.",2024-09-03 22:11:00

16279,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,It felt like you didn't trust my skills.,2024-09-03 22:34:00
16280,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,It's not about trust. I was just worried about our chances to win.,2024-09-03 22:42:00
16281,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_3,Let's focus on what we can improve next time.,2024-09-03 22:47:00
16282,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,"Okay, I can accept that. Maybe we need better communication.",2024-09-03 22:53:00
16283,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_2,Agreed. We could use some hand signals or something.,2024-09-03 23:00:00
16284,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_3,That sounds like a good idea. How about we practice that before the next game?,2024-09-03 23:01:00
16285,deescalatory_conversation_598,speaker_1,I'm up for it. As long as we all give it a shot.,2024-09-03 23:08:00

16290,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,Why didn't you show up for our group project meeting today?,2024-09-03 21:54:04
16291,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,"I had something come up last minute, okay? Why are you making such a big deal out of it?",2024-09-03 22:00:04
16292,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,"Because this project is important, and we all agreed to meet and work on it together. We need your contributions too.",2024-09-03 22:03:04
16293,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,"I know it's important, but things happen. I was going to catch up on the work later.",2024-09-03 22:12:04

16295,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,"I understand that, but you're acting like I do this all the time. It was one meeting.",2024-09-03 22:19:04
16296,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,"Even if it was just one meeting, it disrupts our progress. We need to communicate better if something comes up.",2024-09-03 22:24:04
16297,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_2,"Alright, I get it. I'll text the group next time I can't make it. Can we move past this?",2024-09-03 22:30:04
16298,deescalatory_conversation_599,speaker_1,Absolutely. We just want to ensure we're all on the same page. Let's set another meeting and make the most of it. When are you available?,2024-09-03 22:38:04

16304,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,"I feel like I’ve been doing most of the coding, and we agreed to share the workload equally.",2024-09-03 22:11:07
16305,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,I'm sorry if it seems that way. I've been tied up with the design part. Maybe I underestimated how much time coding takes.,2024-09-03 22:14:07
16306,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,"I understand design is important, but we need to balance things out better. The deadline is approaching, and we can’t afford to fall behind.",2024-09-03 22:23:07
16307,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,You're right. How about we divide the remaining tasks more evenly? I can help with the coding if you need.,2024-09-03 22:33:07
16308,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,That sounds fair. Can you take over the sensor integration part? I’ll finish up the movement algorithms.,2024-09-03 22:42:07
16309,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,Absolutely. I'll start on that today. Thanks for pointing this out.,2024-09-03 22:47:07
16310,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_1,No problem. Let’s just make sure we communicate better moving forward.,2024-09-03 22:56:07
16311,deescalatory_conversation_600,speaker_2,Agreed. We both want to win this competition. Let’s do our best to make it happen.,2024-09-03 23:02:07
